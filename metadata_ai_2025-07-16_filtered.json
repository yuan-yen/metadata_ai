So he talked a lot about the response companies as parallel economy. That's what we've been using our SPACs for. 1789's mandate is even broader than that. It will include some of that. We have, for example, invested in Substack, which is a free speech platform protecting the First Amendment. But we also go into several other areas. One is areas that are going to enhance the security and prosperity of the United States. So think defense tech or the reindustrialization of the United States.  The third is the area that we talked a little bit about, areas that have been underserved, fossil fuels, guns, that we see an arbitrage opportunity in. And then finally, where you're starting to pick up on with polymarket, areas where I think the government or certain incumbents have failed miserably. That's the reason we got into BlinkRx, which reduces drug prices. It's an area of the market where the government has failed to reduce pricing.  And we find this is a disruptor. SpaceX falls into that category as well. NASA failed and SpaceX took the mandate. Polymarket falls into that in that people lost faith with pollsters. They were constantly just paid off and hired mercenaries. And what Polymarket has shown is that you can basically take the markets to try to predict what the truth is.  And because people are going to put their money behind what they really think, it's the same thing you see with using markets in finance in order to predict things. You can do that now with polling around politics and other issues as well. So the last thing I'd say about PolyMarket is it also announced that from Founders Fund they're going to have over a billion dollar valuation, which we like because that marks up our investment three times."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 397.876, "text": " Well, they've been accurate.

It's not that bad.  It is if you're a man. It is if you're a man and you're dragged in front of every court and you're sued for all these... I'm the first person in the history of the world to get sued for paying back a loan on time with interest, just so we're clear. I get it, it's a little bit different, but I think at the time it was something like 18,000 people in New York City paid 84% of the tax. Those people are mobile.  They can move wherever they want. So as a real estate holder in New York, I guess it sucks for me. As a real estate holder in Palm Beach, it's going to be incredible because those people are going to move. They're very mobile. They've had enough. They understand what's going on. And they're not going to continue to subsidize the nonsense that hasn't changed anything. We've seen these promises before. It hasn't worked. It didn't work when they promised communism in Europe. It didn't work in the Soviet Union. Certainly hasn't worked anywhere else that it's been tried in the world. It's created more poverty than any institution imaginable.  And it's sad to see literally the home of the free market, the home of capitalism, New York City, take this sharp turn to the left. And I don't think it's going to work out well, and I think people understand that. It's a little troubling watching Andrew Cuomo now try to come in as this sort of third-party candidate. And just so we're clear, like,  You know, we probably didn't get along that well for the last decade, but my first political fundraiser in history was for Andrew Cuomo because I was a real estate guy in this city.

That's why you've not seen markets rally on all of these trade deals the way you would expect otherwise. There's still a lot of uncertainty, especially to the degree that tariffs are being used as leverage to extract a lot of concessions from the rest of the world.  The one interesting headline which came out a few days ago is that the European Union is now talking to its other non-U.S. trading partners to come up with a joint trading alliance and take a stronger stance to the U.S. I think those are also the things which are interesting, because while the U.S. is a very strong dominant power in the geopolitical space, it is actually forcing the rest of the countries to step up and, you know, do a lot more fiscal spending and also a lot more trade amongst themselves."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 602.637, "text": " Let's zoom out and talk about how all of that impacts the direction of the dollar.

For the longest time, everyone would tell you that the dollar is overvalued, but you could never come up with good enough reasons or catalysts for that dollar weakness to sustain. After a very long time, I can now come up with a lot of reasons for why the dollar weakness will sustain unidirectionally in the remainder of the year.  The capital allocation, that's definitely one which we've seen in Europe. It remains to be seen if other countries follow. But another very interesting bit is that the global investors of the world have been overweight U.S. equities, but they were actually doing that unhedged.

We're talking about Andrew Dudum, CEO of the telehealth company Hims and Hers, which for more than a year has been selling GLP-1s, America's most coveted weight loss drugs.  I'm reading from a story in the forthcoming issue of Bloomberg Businessweek Magazine. It's the August issue, but you can read the story now on Bloomberg.com and on the Bloomberg terminal. Madison Muller and Devin Leonard wrote the story. We've got Madison Muller with us right now. She's Bloomberg News health reporter, and she joins us here in the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers Studio. I think a lot of people are familiar. Well, I would say there are two different types of people who are familiar, maybe three with hims and hers.  There's the investing audience who followed the ups and downs, the roller coaster of this stock. There are the folks who are customers, perhaps, of the company.

I mean, so it's not just us in the subways, not just New Yorkers in the subway. I mean, sure. I talk about weight loss drugs a lot, so I do think I get targeted ads, but like most people I talk to have seen a hims and hers out on Instagram or on Hulu. They advertise a lot.  So people are familiar with the brand. They had this huge Super Bowl ad back in February about their weight loss drugs. And so it's been on people's radars. But I would say that the last year after Hems launched a compounded or copycat GLP-1 drug for a fraction of the price of what, you know, the companies Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly sell their drugs for, it really  put them on the map. I mean, their stock rose a ton in that time. They've experienced enormous growth. They're now worth $11 billion as of the last time I checked. And that is like really what got people talking about them the last year. They are sort of unafraid to  be really loud and vocal in their marketing, sort of push the boundaries a little bit. They want people to be talking about their advertisements, be talking about what the company's doing. So that's sort of like catapulted them, I think, into the conversation and obviously got them on my radar when they started offering these GLP-1 drugs.  How did they actually manage to offer drugs in such a competitive landscape? Would you say now that they're a direct competitor to these giant pharmaceutical companies that are also in on the GLP-1 space? Yeah, no, that's a really good question because these telehealth companies  You know, we did see pharmaceutical giants like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk start to see some of these telehealth companies like him as competitors because they were offering their drugs at a lower price point when Lilly and Novo were struggling with shortages and patients couldn't get the company's branded drugs. And then we saw these telehealth companies crop up offering copycat versions that were allowed during the shortages and really like start to steal market share from them.  And then we saw Novo and Lilly, you know, a few months ago, start partnering with these companies and actually utilizing the platforms and the customer bases that they've built to get their drugs out there to more patients."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 31, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1047.139, "text": "We had a partnership, but then at least the Novo Nordisk partnership with HIMSS, that kind of exploded."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 32, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1052.812, "text": " Yeah, there's been so many twists and turns and ups and downs with this saga over the last few months. I mean, it was a surprise, I think, to a lot of people that Novo Nordisk, huge pharmaceutical company, would choose to partner with a telehealth company that was selling essentially  copycat or knockoff versions of their brand name drugs for a fraction of the price alongside the real ones. And so it was sort of a surprise back then. But, you know, the HIMSS CEO was saying that the two companies were really culturally aligned and promising, you know, that he saw a future for them even beyond weight loss. And then, you know, less than two months after this partnership was announced, we saw Novo Nordisk terminate the deal, sort of accuse HIMSS of  some sketchy behavior. And since then, there's just been this public back and forth between the two companies sort of playing out on social media and playing out in the media, giving interviews to different outlets and sort of like going back and forth, accusing each other of different things. So it's like a really unique situation where we have these two companies duking it out like in a very public way.  You reported on this for months. You've said that you've been working on the story for a long time and spent quite a bit of time with Andrew Dedum, the founder of HIMSS. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit just about kind of his style as a leader, as a founder, his background, and how that's helping HIMSS become like a legit competitor in this very high stakes weight loss drug race. Yeah. I mean, so HIMSS,  Even though it's been around for a few years, I mean, the company started in 2017, went public in 2021, and Andrew's very young. He hasn't really stepped away from this founder, CEO role. He's still very involved in sort of the day-to-day. He's the one that's coming up with new ideas for the company to pursue, bringing him up in board meetings, things, and he is,  He is the one driving the company. And sometimes, you know, we see CEOs like step back a little bit at this point, but he has three kids, you know, three little kids. He's still very, very involved. His vision is sort of where the company goes. And he has this interesting background as well, going to Wharton, where it was sort of like a breeding ground for a lot of direct to consumer companies. And he wasn't out.  like Warby Parker, they went there. There's a few examples that we name in the story. And I don't think Andrew was at school with them, but we sort of see this type of company emerging from Wharton, which is interesting. And Andrew was involved in a lot of different startups. He was at a startup incubator before going into him's full time.

There's some argument over whether or not it's actually a loophole in the FDA legislation that says that these compounding pharmacies can continue to tailor make or personalize, customize these drugs for patients who can't take the versions that are commercially available from pharmaceutical companies.  Essentially, what HIMSS is doing is they're tweaking the dosages, the strengths of the drugs and giving patients lower dose version or titrating, you know, stepping up the amount of drug that they're giving patients more slowly, sort of to mitigate the side effects that are quite common with these drugs, like nausea, vomiting. And so they're saying that, you know, these patients  are not available. You know, they're not able to take the commercially available drugs because they have these side effects. And so they need these personalized versions. And by doing that, they're technically allowed to continue compounding. But the FDA hasn't really stepped in and ruled or said much about this yet. So and we have a new FDA, you know, commissioner now. So we're kind of waiting to see what happens."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 37, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1346.966, "text": "Can you talk a little bit about how he's ingratiated himself in the company with the Trump administration and with RFK specifically?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1353.473, "text": " Yeah, so HIMSS donated a million dollars to Trump's inauguration fund back in January. And since then has been making, you know, sort of broad appeals to the Trump administration, to RFK, to Marty McAree, who's the new FDA commissioner. You know, their Super Bowl ad was very much in line with some of the chief complaints that the Maha movement has about  the healthcare system being broken and pharmaceutical companies incentives and they've really tried to align themselves in some ways with with RFK and with Maha but there's a fundamental difference in that Maha really believes that you know food and diet and exercise are sort of  the ways, should be the primary thing in the healthcare system that people are promoting over pharmaceutical interventions, drugs, and that's what HIMSS does is they sell drugs. So at the end of the day, there's a little bit of a disconnect, I think.  I don't want to spoil the whole story because I definitely want our listeners to go pick up a copy of Bloomberg Businessweek magazine and read your article. But you do start with this anecdote of the CEO creating this donut, this very extravagant donut shop. And I just have to ask, is this like a like a dentist opening up a candy store? Like, why does he have this donut shop? Or is he just an entrepreneur?  I mean, he's just an entrepreneur and this is like him and his wife wanted to create a space where their family and friends could come, you know, in their community. It's like pretty close to where they live. And it's sort of a tribute to Andrew's grandparents as well, who were local, you know, his grandfather was a local business owner in San Francisco as well. And so this was like sort of a passion project for them.  But it is, I mean, if anyone's in San Francisco, they do have good doughnuts. They have very decadent doughnuts, so it's worth checking out.

Ten minutes to go to the close of equity market trading today. Taking a look at how things are. Just got an update from Charlie Pellett. Worth repeating the S&P 500 right now down about two tenths of one percent. The Nasdaq is higher by four tenths of one percent, the Dow down eight tenths of one percent. I want to bring in David George, senior research analyst at Baird. David joins us from Franklin, Tennessee. David, good to have you on with us. How are you?  Great, how are you? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Let's talk big picture here. We heard from the banks, three of the banks today. We'll hear from three more tomorrow. We're sort of at the beginning of earnings season. I think a lot of investors were expecting the last quarter to be pretty bumpy when it came to the outlook for tariffs. We didn't necessarily see that start to seep in. To what extent right now do you think the market is pricing in tariff risk?  You know, that's a that's a great question. I think relatively low. I think that there's a lot of complacency and this is more of a market comment from my perspective rather than the banks, but.  I think there's a lot of complacency around tariffs that the ultimate rates that are being discussed in some of these letters that have gone out over the last few days are going to be something on the order kind of in aggregate, Tim, around the 15% area. So we'll see, to use the president's term, we'll see what happens. But  As it relates to bank earnings, it's not something that we've really seen have much of an impact. I think in the last couple of months, we've seen a pickup in loan demand, and I think part of that stems from  anticipatory buying of inventory. So that has resulted in line of credit utilization picking up to some degree. So there's been some impact there, but we certainly haven't seen any of the negatives as it relates to potential impact on corporate profit margins and so forth. And that's something that will take, if it is indeed an issue, something that will take some time to occur."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 49, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1660.362, "text": " Have we seen any positives? And what I mean by that is sometimes, you know, when bank earnings roll around, you often hear people say that volatility is actually, market volatility is actually good for banks. The traders, you know, pull in more revenue because they're just simply trading more. Did we see that in this current quarter, that all of the market volatility that had to do with tariffs, did it help banks at all?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 50, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1689.556, "text": " Yeah, at the beginning of the quarter it did, Emily. The volatility in currencies, commodities, and markets broadly throughout the month of April and the beginning of May helped derivatives trading, equity trading during the beginning of the quarter. And then as volatility calmed down, we kind of saw the baton being handed off from the  vol-related activity to capital raising activity, M&A. So we saw a number of IPOs and secondary offerings throughout the tail end of the quarter, as well as a pickup in M&A. And the momentum of late seems to be more on that end rather than volatility-related activity.  I do want to make a note that the President is right now making comments at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh. He made some comments about investments from tech companies. You can check out LiveGo. He's attending the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation event. You can watch and see his comments on LiveGo."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 51, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1753.124, "text": " David, I want to ask you specifically about earnings here from JP Morgan because you downgraded JPM to an underperform. You said the risk reward is getting unattractive. Talk a little bit more about that stock rating, that stock call that you made."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 52, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1770.185, "text": " Yeah, the stock call really is just a call on the stock itself. Many times the fundamentals of a company and the stock aren't necessarily one and the same. And I think that's true in this case. We have the utmost respect for JP Morgan. It's probably the best company that I cover fundamentally. I just believe that, and we believe that the market  has priced it that way. J.P. Morgan trades at over 15 times earnings. It trades at close to three times tangible book. If you were to look on your Bloomberg terminal and run a historical valuation analysis on J.P. Morgan, it would suggest that it's never been more expensive. And the market is pricing in, we think,  a permanent improvement in profitability relative to the rest of the industry. And banking to us as a commodity and as great as JP Morgan is, we're of the view that the excess returns that they've been able to generate are gonna be a little bit more normal going forward. And we simply think that the upside is fairly limited. So we're paid to have an opinion and we think that investors should sell the stock.  OK, well, let's talk a little bit about tomorrow and Bank of America. You upgraded Bank of America in April. What should investors be on the lookout for now, and why are you bullish on the company?  Yeah, so we actually downgraded B of A to neutral the same day we cut JP Morgan to a sell. But that stock was up over 30% in just that couple month period of time. I think B of A's quarter tomorrow is going to be relatively good. I think expectations around that stock are not nearly as high as perhaps Wells Fargo today.  as well as JP Morgan. So B of A should benefit from all of the things that we've talked about as it relates to volatility related activity in the capital markets. And then obviously Merrill Lynch benefits from asset prices being elevated. So we think Merrill's gonna have a pretty good quarter and the bank is performing well at the same time. And the stock has lagged peers. So we think expectations are low and we feel  We feel okay about B of A going into tomorrow. I think that the numbers are going to be good. We have an interview with Brian Moynihan tomorrow afternoon in the two o'clock hour, so I encourage everybody to check that out. David Weston will be doing that interview with Bank of America's Brian Moynihan. Okay, so you talked about J.P. Morgan, you talked a little bit about Bank of America. If you think about the broader group of banks and the banks as a broader group, are you thinking that they're  I don't know. What are you thinking about in the context of this rate environment? Nobody can really make sense of the rate environment right now. You hear one thing from the White House, you hear a completely different thing from the Federal Reserve. What's your view?  Yeah, I think the answer is somewhere in the middle, like most things in life. I think it's reasonable to expect that the tariff impact is likely to be, I'm reluctant to use the word transitory, but is likely to not have a longer term impact on inflation expectations. So I think it's reasonable to expect that, and the curve is pricing this in even after today, around 50 to 75 basis points of cuts.  by the end of calendar 2025. If the long end stays where it is, which we think it's going to be in that 425 to 450 range for the foreseeable future, that's actually a pretty good environment for banks. If you go back the last three or four years, we've had a very flat, if not inverted, yield curve for some time. And that has had a negative impact  on the profitability of banks, particularly the regional banks. So, to the extent we can get a sustained, positive-shaped curve, we think that's going to actually have pretty positive implications for most banks going forward. David, thanks so much for chatting with us this afternoon, talking all things banks. We've got to get you back on soon.

And there are now five candidates running in November. In addition to Mamdani, Cuomo will also face Republican Curtis Slua and two other independents, including embattled incumbent mayor Eric Adams.  Joining me now to break down the field's top candidates is national political reporter Steve Kornacki at the big board. Hey there, Steve. We have a crowded field. Everyone's saying, everyone says they're staying in until November. But what are the candidates looking at to make that decision?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 106.9, "text": " Yeah, Gabe, so it's interesting. Here are the three major, as you say, the three major general election opponents for Mamdani right now. Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams, the current mayor, Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee. And this is what they're saying to each other. No, you drop out. Because here's the dynamic, basically, that each one of them is looking at. And there is a point of agreement between the three of them. And the point of agreement that Adams, Sliwa, and Cuomo all have is that Mamdani  can be beaten, or that if he's going to be beaten, it would be by a united front of opposition behind one alternative, a one-on-one race. And they agree that if it's a splintered, fractured field, that's going to benefit Mamdani. Where they disagree is on who that one candidate should be, because they each look at each other and they say, they're too weak.  to be  who's still unpopular with New York City voters. The most recent public poll on this had Cuomo's unfavorable rating at 47% with New York City voters, his favorable rating lower than that, just 41%. So if you're Adams and you're Sliwa, and you're looking at Cuomo saying he's staying in this race, they're looking at him saying, hey, you had your shot at Mamdani. You proved you couldn't get it done. So then shift here from Cuomo  to Eric Adams. What does a Cuomo, what does Sliwa see when they look at Eric Adams? They look at the incumbent mayor, somebody who got elected to this job four years ago, who says, hey, there's some stats last week showing violent crime coming down. He thinks he's got a record to run on. But if you're Cuomo and you're Sliwa, here's what you see. The most recent public poll, favorable, unfavorable for Adams, 68, 68.  unfavorable. His favorable just 19 percent. Remember the indictment on federal corruption charges? Then the Trump DOJ saying they're dropping the case. Enormous, enormous political baggage for Eric Adams. So you're, you're saying, well that guy,  Can't beat Mom Donnie. And then this action shifts over here to Curtis Sliwa. Now, Curtis Sliwa is a familiar figure to New Yorkers. He started the Guardian Angels Group in the high-crime 1980s. He's been a ubiquitous figure in media in New York City for four decades now. But Sliwa's got a track record here. He was the Republican nominee four years ago, just like he's the Republican nominee now. He ran against Adams four years ago. How did he do?  He got 28% of the vote. He lost to Eric Adams by more than 40 points. So Adams and Cuomo are looking at Sliwa and saying, Republicans, they almost never win in New York City. And this guy already tried and got trounced. So why would I, Andrew Cuomo, why would I, Eric Adams, defer to Curtis Sliwa?  That's it. Each one of them brings a chunk of support into this general election, but none of them with a big, broad enough coalition and an accomplished enough track record to make the others say, I'll back off, you take a shot at it. And as long as that dynamic persists, Gabe, the winner in this situation is the Democratic nominees. Zoran Mamdani. Never a dull day in New York City politics. Steve Kornacki, thank you.

And we begin in Pennsylvania, where President Trump is speaking at a summit on AI and energy, as he seeks to tout a key provision in the sweeping legislation congressional Republicans delivered for him in a state that helped deliver him the White House. Here's a live look at that summit in Pittsburgh, where the president just formally announced a $90 billion investment in AI, along with the energy needed to power it."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 89.013, "text": " Today's commitments are ensuring that the future is going to be designed, built, and made right here in Pennsylvania and right here in Pittsburgh, and I have to say, right here in the United States of America."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Tariffs"], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 101.332, "text": " The summit is one of the president's first opportunities to sell his so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, which was not viewed favorably, according to major polls, when it was signed into law on July 4th. A fact Democrats are hoping to capitalize on in next year's midterms, as they focus on the bill's cuts to Medicaid and its benefits for wealthy households.  And now, Republicans are looking for new ways to sell the legislation to voters, with strategists telling NBC News they're advising lawmakers to rebrand the bill as the Trump Working Family Tax Cuts. It all comes as the Labor Department reported today that inflation ticked up to 2.7 percent in June, compared to one a year earlier.  Compared to one year earlier, the price increase is sparked by the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The president is using those numbers to once again attack Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as he demands the Fed boost the economy by cutting interest rates.

All we have is we're making a fortune."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 190.837, "text": " NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Julie Serkin joins me now from Pittsburgh and also with me is NBC News business and data correspondent Brian Chung. Julie, I want to start with you. What's the purpose of today's summit? Well, it's exactly as you laid out, Gabe. He's touting the $90 billion investment in Pennsylvania. Trump spending a large time of chunk on stage. You hear him still talking behind my shoulder. They are talking about this investment, blaming President Biden, something he likes to do in his administration.  in what he called as killing coal in this state. Instead, of course, the focus for this event, Gabe, is all about artificial intelligence and energy. 60-plus business leaders are here. As I was walking through the hallway all day long, there are a lot of different inventions presented by all these different companies, especially when it comes to AI and how that could help take the U.S. into the future. They really want to make sure  this state that is, of course, so critical politically, but also practically with all the industry in the state, is center stage, is front of stage in terms of the U.S. leading the way on AI and energy production here. It was also notable, of course, because this is McCormick, who's a freshman senator from this state, just won in November. It's one of his first big events since becoming senator. And so the fact that he was able to bring all this together, of course, a lot of attention on this and all of the cabinet secretaries that are here as well, what the president here gave.  Yeah, and Julie, any coincidence that this is taking place in Pennsylvania? It just happens to be the most important battleground state which Donald Trump won both in 2016 and 2024.  absolutely no coincidence there, and even Trump when he started talking made that extremely clear. This is his third trip, by the way, Gabe, as I'm sure you know well, since he was inaugurated to this state, to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He campaigned really hard here in the final days of the 2024 election, so it is absolutely no coincidence that he is here  And by the way, touting parts of that mega bill that he just signed into law, specifically focused on those tax cuts, specifically focused on provisions that could help businesses that are here gathered today to hear from him. But we asked Governor Josh Shapiro, who was also here earlier today, excited about this investment, of course, in his state, what he thinks about the bill. Take a listen to what he said. 26,000 Pennsylvanians are going to lose their jobs in the energy sector.  It's somewhat ironic that we're here talking about energy jobs and the bill that the president presumably will be tallying would gut 26,000 energy jobs.  Also notable, I think, is that the president is pointing out here that artificial intelligence puts such a demand on the power grid. He said here that artificial intelligence is going to cause the grid to need twice as more power in the future. So if you juxtapose that with Shapiro's comments, there are two different visions of the same reality, which is something we see often.  Two very different visions. Julia, look, Republicans just delivered this huge legislative victory to President Trump by passing what he calls his one big beautiful bill. But now we have that new reporting that some Republicans may be seeking to rebrand that legislation. Why?  Yeah, they want to call it the working families tax cut. Look, there's a lot of provisions in this thousand page bill that are frankly unpopular. And it's why you don't hear Trump and you don't hear Republicans talking about them. But what you did see is something like a move from Senator Josh Hawley out of Missouri, who a couple hours ago actually released new legislation to try and cut back and change and undo some of the very provisions that were passed into law as part of this bill concerning Medicaid and some of the  food stamp benefits and other social safety net programs that could be very damaging if Democrats play their cards right over the next 18 months, especially in swing states and in battleground states like this one in Pennsylvania. So that is something that Shapiro pointed out, even when he was talking on a panel down the hall from me earlier today. This is going to be a tough thing for Republicans to get over, and it's why they're only focused on the provisions that poll well, like those tax cuts.  Julie Cirkin, live for us in Pittsburgh. Julie, thank you. I want to turn now to Brian Chung. And Brian, we've heard for years about how AI could take Americans' jobs. This summit, though, is focused on how it could create thousands of jobs. Explain how.  Yeah well the economic impact of artificial intelligence cannot be understated not just for the energy implications that Julie just walked you through but also for the workforce implications as well. In fact a recent survey done globally estimates that about 40 percent of employers expect to reduce their workforce where work can be automated as a result of this artificial intelligence technology.  Now, 11 million jobs, though, are expected to be created as a result of artificial intelligence. Think about all these new industries, all these new companies that are popping up that are fueling this type of hiring. But it could also be at risk of displacing 9 million jobs, a.k.a. forcing people out of old industries that might get outdated and replaced by artificial intelligence, and then forcing those jobs to move elsewhere. That's a big reason why not just policymakers, but even everyday people are wondering what could be the ripple effects of this artificial intelligence technology.  technology. There are real benefits like, for example, curing cancer. But on the other side, there's also the worry that it could have a real threat to humanity, as the likes of Sam Ullman and Elon Musk have warned themselves. So very much big pros and big cons to that technology. Well, Brian, this comes on the same day that the Labor Department reported that inflation was heating up, although the president is trying to make the case that it was up only slightly. How much of a factor were tariffs in those price increases?  Yeah, well, economists have said that this inflation report that we got today covering the month of June was the first real inflation report where we started to see the impact of the tariff. So I want to point out here again what we're talking about when we say 2.7 percent, that's how much prices rose between June of this year and June of last year. That is a tick up from what we saw in terms of inflation rates earlier this year, but lower than the 3 percent that we had seen at the end of last year. Now, when you unpack the specific categories,  We've seen food inflation. Energy prices are also going up. So are shelter costs. The cost of putting a roof over your head. These are monthly changes that we're looking at here. But here is where we have seen some of the questions over the impacts of the tariffs. You're not seeing it everywhere. You're not really seeing it in eggs where prices are actually down compared to a few months ago. I know that's welcome news to a lot of people at the store.  milk prices are about the same. And to the president's point gasoline prices are also down by about 30 cents per gallon. But here are the categories game where we are starting to see some of the tariff impacts. These are monthly changes 2 percent in one month alone increases in appliances and toys furniture and bedding rising by four tenths of a percent as well which caught the eye of a lot of analysts. These are categories that don't usually make these types of moves. That's the reason why it's likely due to the tariffs. How will this be impacted in the months to come. That's the open question from here.  Huge question right there. Now, Brian, I was just at the White House a short time ago, and President Trump once again called on the Fed to cut interest rates. So does today's inflation report make it more or less likely that the Fed will cut rates?  Yeah, it makes the Fed less likely to cut rates full stop. And the reason why is because if the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates, there's a worry among Fed policymakers that that would make inflation worse. So if this inflation report shows the rate of price increases going up, then they don't want to cut interest rates into that environment. So as the president is calling on the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, who he's applied quite a lot of pressure to in the last few weeks,  asking the Fed to cut interest rates by 3%, that is simply not going to happen in an environment where the rate of inflation is rising, which very much puts the Fed chair at odds continually with the President, as we've seen. Continually, the President keeps criticizing him, calling him too late Powell, as he likes to say. Now, Brian Cheung, our business and data correspondent, thank you so much. And turning now to Russia and the fallout after President Trump threatened to impose, quote,  very severe tariffs on countries doing business with Moscow if President Putin does not agree to a ceasefire deal within 50 days. A Kremlin spokesperson responded to those comments today, saying Russia takes the statement very seriously, but needs time to analyze what the president said.  But it's not just economic pressure President Trump appears to be leveraging. According to a report by the Financial Times, citing people briefed on the discussions during a July 4th conversation, President Trump privately encouraged Ukraine to step up strikes deep inside Russian territory and even asked Ukrainian President Zelensky whether he could strike Moscow if the U.S. provided long-range weapons.  The White House is downplaying that conversation, telling me the president was simply asking a question, not encouraging any strikes. Here's what the president told me and other reporters when I asked about the issue earlier today. Should Zelensky target Moscow or deeper into Russia? No, he shouldn't target Moscow. Are you on Ukraine's side now? No, I'm on nobody's side. I'm on nobody's side. Why? You know the side I'm on? Humanity's side.  Humanities side, all right. Joining me now from Moscow is NBC News Chief International Correspondent Keir Simmons. Keir, we really appreciate your time inside Russia.

And people here in Russia, and this is, I think, really one of the most important reasons why we're here, people here in Russia, of course, also we're hearing about all of this. And what we really got on the streets of Moscow here was a sense of defiance.  feeling targeted, but also many said, telling us they'd like to see an end to the war.

Well, of course it is an alarming news. It is an alarming news, I have to say that, because I live in Moscow, and I've heard about the drones hits, and I actually seen the drones one time.

Again, Kier, we really do appreciate your reporting. Fascinating conversation. And coming up, as the Trump administration ramps up its sweeping deportation agenda, my one-on-one interview with the Republican lawmaker leading a bipartisan push for immigration reform with a path to legal status for some undocumented immigrants.  Plus, waltz on the hill. President Trump's pick to be United Nations ambassador was on Capitol Hill today facing questions about his role in the Signal Gate controversy that leaked sensitive military plans. You're watching Meet the Press Now. Stay with us.  And welcome back. As the Trump administration ramps up its mass deportation efforts, today a group of bipartisan lawmakers announced a bill that would provide legal status for some undocumented immigrants. The Dignity Act, sponsored by Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Vida Salazar and Texas Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, would allow undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. since before 2021 to apply for up to seven years of legal status with work authorization, provided  They pay restitution and check in with DHS regularly. It also includes enhanced border security provisions and protections for DREAMers. At a press event today, Salazar was quick to point out that the bill does not include a pathway to citizenship. She insisted the bill does not provide amnesty.  Remember that dignity is not amnesty. It does not have path to citizenship. We're not talking about becoming Americans. We are trying to just bring them out of the shadows and have them go work in peace, pay taxes, and come back home again.  And joining me now is Florida Republican Congresswoman Marivela Salazar here in the in-studio. Congresswoman, we really appreciate your time on a significant day for you. Look, we have seen different immigration reform plans fail in Congress before. This Dignity Act, you put forward something similar back in 2023, I believe. What makes this attempt different?  Everything in life is timing, and everything in politics is timing, and this is the time for something like this. The border is secured. The BBB assures $150 billion for border security in the southern border. Now it's time to have a national conversation as to what are we going to do with those people who have been here for more than five years.  They are needed in the economy, they don't have a criminal record, and they are needed. So dignity is the best solution, is not path to citizenship, is not amnesty. It only lets them stay, work, and pay taxes. I thought it was interesting, I was hearing, I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong here, but if they pay $7,000 over seven years,  and 1% of their income or their salary over seven years. We're talking about two pots of money. One, $50 billion that we're going to give back to the Treasury, and the other one is $70 billion that we can use to re-educate or retrain American workers. That's a lot of money. What makes you think, though, that the Trump administration will go for this?  Because Trump has, first of all, President Trump is a businessman. He's the construction guy. He said it, that the construction, hospitality, and agricultural are needed. He understands it. And this is the moment where now the border is sealed. And after the BBB, he has that ability.  I said in my speech, you know, he was the one who attacked Iran and he said to China, don't stop eating our lunch. Trump dares to do things that other Republicans or Democrats in the White House have not dared. And I have all the faith in the world that he will take this up very soon.  That may be the case. A lot of his supporters, though, and including some of his top aides, for example, Stephen Miller, the architect of his immigration policy, has been for years. They would, my guess would be, they would look at this and have some serious questions about it. Because a lot of Trump voters, they voted for mass deportations.  Mass deportation of Tlinderagua, mass deportation of the bad hombres, mad deportation of the illegal who are criminals. But Trump knows that those workers are needed and we are ramping up the economy again. But that is not what is currently happening. Just that, yes, Tom Holman, the border czar, and I've spoken to him many times, he has said that the priority is  undocumented immigrants with criminal records, but according to this administration, they believe that every immigrant who is here illegally is breaking the law. How do you respond to that? And they have broken the law, but the thing is that someone gave them a job for the last decades because they were needed, because that person needed hands or workers, workers that are still needed today. Trump is a very practical leader.  Trump is a common-sense guy. This is the perfect solution for a problem that is brewing and that it's looming and is going to create problems in the economy. Trump is the only elected official with J.D. Vance in the White House. He is the one who will make the decision.  He is the only elected official with J.D. Vance. However, Stephen Miller, again, he holds a lot of influence in this White House. He is the deputy chief of staff. Oh, I have no doubt that that's the truth, but at the end, the one who makes the decisions at the White House is the president, and the president is a common-sense leader. Besides, I told him he could be for immigration what Lincoln was for slavery and what Reagan was for communism. He'll take up the opportunity. I have no doubt. Have you spoken to House Speaker Mike Johnson about this?  I have spoken with Johnson a lot, and he knows about the bill. Johnson is a great, great leader. And now is when the race starts. We just filed for this bill today, and now it's the time where we're going to start bringing the support.  You are doing something that is unusual these days in Congress. This is a bipartisan bill. Veronica Escobar from Texas is partnering with you on that. 11 people, 11 Republicans, 11 Democrats to start off with.  OK, and I want to ask you about something. You have carved out a very interesting path here in the modern Republican Party. You're seen as a moderate. You're a Trump supporter. You have seemed to have disagreed with him on some aspects of immigration. And I want to understand your position here. Regarding temporary protected status, the Trump administration has revoked that. You criticized the Supreme Court for allowing that revocation to go forward.  Was the Trump administration wrong to revoke temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of immigrants?  I think that those people and those people fall into dignity. Once again, if you have been here for more than five years, TPS, I-220 for the Cubans, if you've been here, you do not have a criminal record, and you are needed in the economy. It's only intelligent on our part to not give you a path to citizenship, to allow you to stay, to pay taxes, to buy homes, to open bank accounts, and to consume and to be part of the economy.  There's no way that we're going to be able to continue being the number one economy in the world with a number one military if we do not have hands in the economy, period. So this is the common sense approach. It's national security. We will know then who's here. They'll come out and say, hey, this is Pepe Perez, and we'll know where they are and where they live.  They will contribute to social security because we do have a big pothole there that we need to fill. And so, you know, it's impossible to be deporting 10 million people. The American people will not allow that. So we just brought the solution. Soleimani.  solution you say that however there are many in the Trump administration again and I revert back to Stephen Miller they do want to see 10 million or more they argue there's more than 20 million undocumented immigrants in this country they do want all them that's what to them mass deportation means there is one boss  Donald Trump. He has campaigned on mass deportation. Yeah, he campaigned. He campaigned on deporting the illegals who are criminals. And we all agree with that. They can leave the country. So you say that this legislation, this bill, would be a solution for the problem of letting TPS expire. Was it a mistake to let TPS expire?  I think that everything, that TPS is part of dignity, and even if it expired with dignity, they can continue being legal citizens in the United States. Right, but this bill has not passed. So I know it's difficult."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1429.552, "text": "It will."}, {"keywords": ["Tariffs"], "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1429.853, "text": "I know it's tough because, you know, politically you're in Florida. Hey, you know, hey. But you disagree with some parts of the Trump agenda when it comes to immigration.  Look, politics is the art of the possible. And we are still in the best country on Earth. And I know the process is not as messy, and it's not easy, and sometimes you don't agree on one thing. But it's still, every time I walk into the Capitol, I say, oh my god, if the Cubans, the Nicaraguans, the Venezuelans, the North Koreans, the Iranians were able to see and experience this magnificent system that we have, which is the American democracy. So we are here and enjoying it.  Are we going to bring solutions to the American people? We do have some new numbers from Gallup last week that said that 78% of Americans, including nearly 60% of Republicans, they do favor a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. So why doesn't your bill offer that pathway? Is that an acknowledgment that in a Republican Party that cannot happen?  Because I want a solution. I want a solution right away. I'm trying to bring a solution to the president that will solve the problem right away. Patrick's citizenship could be considered in another bill if that is what the White House wants, if that is what leadership in the GOP, at the House of Representatives, in the House. It's just right now, let's do what's possible, what's fast, and what will keep those workers in place.  And I have been to the border extensively on border. The Trump administration, as it said, it's been very successful in reducing illegal border crossings. We have seen footage of those ICE raids. There have been clashes with protesters. Some communities across the country, whether it be Los Angeles and even Miami, have  been very concerned about some of the tactics that ICE has done. Do you agree with all of the tactics that ICE has deployed in order to round up undocumented immigrants, including some who are collateral arrests who do not have criminal records?  I don't think that we should be arresting those people who have been in the country more than five years, don't have a criminal record, are good for the economy, and they are needed in construction, hospitality, and agricultural. I know that there is a quota. I don't like a number. That's why I'm saying to President Trump, this is the Solomonic Way, and you will be able to pass down in history as the guy who solved this 40-year problem called immigration.

You're watching Meet the Press Now. Stay with us.  And welcome back. If it's Tuesday, someone's voting somewhere. And today, that somewhere is Arizona's 7th congressional district, where a special primary election is Democrats grappling with questions that continue to divide the party tied to age, experience, and ideology.  The deep blue district stretching from Phoenix to Tucson and down to the Mexican border has been vacant since the death of longtime congressman Raul Grijalva in March. The frontrunner is his daughter, Adelita Grijalva, a progressive with two decades of experience in Tucson politics. But also vying for the seat is Deja Fox, a 25-year-old reproductive rights activist and social media influencer, along with Daniel Hernandez, a former state legislator who's running on a more moderate platform.  So, here we go, NBC News correspondent and Arizona native Von Hilliard, my colleague, joins me now from Tucson. Von, it is great to see you down there. Deja Fox is less than half the age of Adelita Grujalva, so have these candidates been, how have these candidates, rather, been grappling with these questions of age and experience in this race?  Right. July election day is not a normal one. And yet this special election in so many ways is going to tell us a lot, not just about Southern Arizona, but nationally for the Democratic Party that is looking for their way forward. They're looking at a race that is a generational matchup here. It's not so much who's more progressive.  Adelita Grijalva or Deja Fox, it's more so both of these candidates leaning into their age. In the hands of Deja Fox, it's making the case that at the age of 25, she first was introduced to politics when Donald Trump, in 2015, started entering politics. And essentially, the better part of her life has been a byproduct of his administration and his political era.  And so in a lot of ways, she says that, look, when she was living here in Tucson, she understands the consequences of decisions up on Capitol Hill when it comes to SNAP, to Medicaid, and to affordable housing. And I want to let you listen to my exchange with Deja Fox.  about age, as well as my asking Adelita Grijalva, who's the 54-year-old daughter of Raul Grijalva, why her age is beneficial, and to push back on Deja Fox's claim that she's in the best position to represent young people.

And still to come, Andrew Cuomo is officially back in the race to be the next mayor of New York City, despite a bruising primary loss to a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist. Steve Kornacki's at the big board, breaking down what Cuomo's third-party bid means for November's general election. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  And welcome back. Turning now to a major development in the race for New York City mayor. Coming just three weeks after 33-year-old Democratic Socialist Zoran Mondani stunned his party with a convincing 13-point primary victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo. But Cuomo is not backing down, announcing he'll stay in the race as an independent. In a video announcement, Cuomo took a clear shot at his opponent while leaning into the same issue that drove Mondani's success, affordability.  Only 13% of New Yorkers voted in the June primary. The general election is in November, and I am in it to win it. My opponent, Mr. Mondani, offers slick slogans, but no real solutions. We need a city with lower rents, safer streets, where buying your first home is once again possible, where child care won't bankrupt you. That's the New York City we know. That's the one that is still possible.  The Mamdani campaign quickly responding to Cuomo's candidacy with a statement reading in part, he's not fighting for you, he's running only to repair his soiled reputation and protect the billionaire Trump donors who fund his campaign. We beat Cuomo once, together we will beat him again. And there are now five candidates running in November. In addition to Mamdani, Cuomo will also face Republican Curtis Slua and two other independents, including embattled incumbent mayor  Eric Adams. And joining me now to break down the field's top candidates is national political reporter Steve Kornacki at the Big Board. Hey there, Steve. We have a crowded field. Everyone's saying, everyone says they're staying in until November, but what are the candidates looking at to make that decision?  Yeah, Gabe, so it's interesting. Here are the three major, as you say, the three major general election opponents for Mamdani right now. Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams, the current mayor, Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee. And this is what they're saying to each other. No, you drop out. Because here's the dynamic, basically, that each one of them is looking at. And there is a point of agreement between the three of them. And the point of agreement that Adams, Sliwa, and Cuomo all have is that Mamdani  can be beaten or that if he's going to be beaten, it would be by a united front of opposition behind one alternative, a one-on-one race. And they agree that if it's a splintered, fractured field, that's going to benefit Mamdani. Where they disagree is on who that one candidate should be, because they each look at each other and they say they're too weak to beat Mamdani. So, for instance, Cuomo, who says, as you say, he's staying in the race. Now, Cuomo,  What his opponents see, what Adams and Sliwa see when they look at him is a candidate who just got beat by Bhamdani in the Democratic primary after starting that race as the overwhelming favorite. They see somebody with the baggage of scandal, resigned as governor four years ago amidst controversy. They see somebody who's still unpopular with New York City voters. The most recent public poll on this had Cuomo's unfavorable rating at 47 percent.  with New York City voters, his favorable rating lower than that, just 41%. So if you're Adams and you're Sliwa, and you're looking at Cuomo saying he's staying in this race, they're looking at him saying, hey, you had your shot at Mamdani. You proved you couldn't get it done. So then shift here from Cuomo  to Eric Adams. What does a Cuomo, what does Sliwa see when they look at Eric Adams? They look at the incumbent mayor, somebody who got elected to this job four years ago, who says, hey, there's some stats last week showing violent crime coming down. He thinks he's got a record to run on. But if you're Cuomo and you're Sliwa, here's what you see, the most recent public poll, favorable, unfavorable for Adams, 68, 68.  unfavorable. His favorable just 19 percent. Remember the indictment on federal corruption charges? Then the Trump DOJ saying they're dropping the case. Enormous, enormous political baggage for Eric Adams. So you're sleewy. You're coming here saying, well, that guy  Can't beat Mom Donnie. And then this action shifts over here to Curtis Sliwa. Now, Curtis Sliwa is a familiar figure to New Yorkers. He started the Guardian Angels group in the high-crime 1980s. He's been a ubiquitous figure in media in New York City for four decades now. But Sliwa's got a track record here. He was the Republican nominee four years ago, just like he's the Republican nominee now. He ran against Adams four years ago. How did he do?  He got 28% of the vote. He lost to Eric Adams by more than 40 points. So Adams and Cuomo are looking at Sliwa and saying, Republicans, they almost never win in New York City. And this guy already tried and got trounced. So why would I, Andrew Cuomo, why would I, Eric Adams, defer to Curtis Sliwa?  That's it. Each one of them brings a chunk of support into this general election, but none of them with a big, broad enough coalition and an accomplished enough track record to make the others say, I'll back off, you take a shot at it. And as long as that dynamic persists, Gabe, the winner in this situation is the Democratic nominees, Zoran Mamdani. Never a dull day in New York City politics. Steve Kornacki, thank you.  Got it. And joining me now is our panel. Shelby Talcott, White House correspondent for Semaphore, Democratic strategist Naveen Nayak, and former Republican congressman from Florida, Carlos Cabello. He's also an NBC News political analyst. Now, Shelby, I want to start with you. Cuomo conceded the primary after losing to Mondani, but is there a level of arrogance here for him to come back here and think he can win over New Yorkers now?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 25, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2233.184, "text": " I mean, that's a good question. I think there's no question. I think everyone has said that he ran a poor campaign Originally, so perhaps he thinks that he can come back and sort of run a better campaign and do things correctly but I also think that his strategy really as was just laid out relies on everybody else dropping out and I don't know if that's a particularly strong  strategy in any state, especially New York, when you're considering how crowded the race is and how each candidate is probably thinking that they have the upper hand and why would they drop out, as again was just laid out. That's not the strongest strategy against Mamdani, who has run a really grassroots campaign, who won because he was so effective, and he was so effective at the social media strategy, he was so effective at getting out on the ground and talking to voters.

Would you prefer him over... I don't want to say. You know, I'm a Republican. He's a Democrat or an Independent. No, I think Andrew would have a good shot at winning. He's got to run a tough campaign. You know, he's running against the Communists. I would think that he would have a good shot at winning.  Now, if you're Andrew Cuomo, is that the last thing that you want to hear? And if you're Mondani, on the flip side, is that the best thing that you can possibly hear? And we're just seeing that, according to his campaign, he's trying to make it seem that President Trump endorsed Andrew Cuomo. Technically, he didn't, but that's how the Mondani campaign is looking at this.  Sure, it goes to the point that Cuomo's path here doesn't make any sense, even if the other candidates get out of there. Like, Mamdani got more votes in a Democratic primary than anyone ever in the history of New York. I think there's a lot more Democrats who would be very comfortable voting for someone whose only priority is affordability and the cost of living in New York. And Cuomo seems to be playing for a very small slice. I mean, honestly, Wall Street  And like, the few people who live around there and work there. To that point, you know, Carlos...

And he did have an opportunity there to sort of hit Mamdani.  First part of his argument we've heard from Mamdani critics. We've heard the argument that he is sort of, you know, laying out all these ideas that sound great in practice, but when you put it into practice are not going to work.

You might not agree with the substance, but there are real policy proposals there.  doing a lot of long-term damage to the Democratic Party, Cuomo, because, you know, Mondani's become this boogeyman for the right. Depending on some of the attacks, you know, if Cuomo goes after him about certain things, is he going to try to walk that fine line not to, you know, come across with all these Republican talking points, essentially? And this inter-party battle, is it good or bad for the Democratic Party?  I mean, my take on this, on the first hand, is that I think Andrew Cuomo cares about himself. He's not in this for the Democratic Party. He lost the Democratic primary. The traditional path would have been to endorse the Democrat and move forward. And, you know, I'm heartened by, if this were, you know, the Wisconsin Senate race, Democrats have avoided these kinds of fracturing in ways that Republicans have struggled to actually unify. And so it's New York mayor. But I do think he, you know, he'll bring more attention to the race. He'll bring more attention to Mamdani. There's no doubt.  Well, Shelby, I want to end with you since we're running a long time. But I do quickly want to expand our window from New York Democrats to the National Party. And I want to mention what former President Obama told the fundraiser on Friday. He said, he had this message. He said, I think it's going to require a little bit less navel-gazing and a little less whining and being in fetal positions. It's going to require Democrats to just toughen up.

And I think the Democratic Party realized that they needed to be almost more like the Republican Party has been in terms of fighting. The problem is there's different strategies.

We really appreciate it.  And up next, we're live on Capitol Hill where former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was grilled by Senate Democrats today over the leaking of sensitive military plans in an unsecured group chat he created. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  Welcome back. President Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, faced senators today at his confirmation hearing to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. It is the first time Waltz has faced lawmakers since he was ousted from the White House after he mistakenly added a journalist to a Signal Group chat earlier this year to discuss sensitive U.S. military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen. Despite that, it took more than an hour for any senator to press Waltz on the fallout. Here's some of what he said.  The use of Signal is not only, as an encrypted app, is not only authorized, it was recommended in Biden's, the Biden-era CISA guidance."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2785.593, "text": "The question I asked was were you investigated for this expansion of the Signal group to include a journalist?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 39, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 2794.206, "text": "The White House conducted an investigation and my understanding is the Department of Defense is still conducting an investigation.  And joining me now is NBC News Chief Capitol Hill Correspondent Ryan Nobles. Ryan, thank you for joining us here. You know, there were some questions about the signal chant controversy, as we pointed out, but it didn't appear to be the main line of questioning. So was that a deliberate strategy by Democrats?  I think what you see play out in these hearings often, Gabe, is that Democrats kind of divide and conquer. There was an issue here that while they certainly wanted to ask questions about the Signal Gate controversy, they also wanted to ask questions about the U.N. ambassadorship and this important role that Waltz is set to take over. And they also were complicated by the fact that he wasn't the only witness today. There were two other witnesses who were going through the confirmation process as well. So you did see two senators in particular.  Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who you just showed, and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, who really focused a lot of their opportunity to ask questions and attempting to pin waltz down on some of these questions related to Signal Gate. And what they came up with was basically a series of talking points, retreating to many of the same things that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said. And they left pretty much empty-handed trying to get to the bottom of how this all came to be.  So it sounds like we didn't learn a whole lot about it, but there was also a lot of mention of the UN's position towards the Israel-Hamas war and the role of UNRWA. What did we hear from the former National Security Advisor about that?  Well, it seems very clear that he is going to extend the same level of support to Israel that the current administration has. And when it comes to the conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, that the U.S. is going to side with Israel. And the U.S. has really been a defender of Israel in the United Nations when Security Council resolutions come up condemning some of the violence there, accusing Israel, for instance, of war crimes. The U.S. has never supported resolutions in that vein.  Mike Waltz made it very clear that that would continue with him in the ambassadorship, regardless of how this process plays itself out and the direction the U.N. takes in the years to come. And Ryan, before I let you go, you also have some other reporting about Congressman Comer, who's leading the investigation into President Biden's mental acuity and his use of an auto pen. What can you tell us about that?  Yeah, we're on a hard wrap, and that's a complicated story, so I suggest go to NBCNews.com to read it. But essentially, James Comer accusing the administration, the former administration, of using an auto pen to sign sensitive documents. Comer himself using a digital signature to sign many of the interview requests that he's had for the people that are part of that investigation. As I said, we've got it all on NBCNews.com, Gabe.  complicated story. Thank you very much. Ryan Novos, unfortunately, we are out of time.

Talking about cities being hellholes. I just want to point to Los Angeles.  I'm sure that's one of the cities they were referring to when they said that. Los Angeles contributes almost $20 billion in taxes. You know what? That's more than all states in this country, except for four. So guess what? If we are gonna push any ideologies, it seems like LA should have an outsized interest in the ideology, because it seems like they actually contribute more money than all these other states, especially these red states, to be clear. In fact, I have another UC.  All right, blue states are bailing out red states. I have another you see Mass Massachusetts sends more funding to the feds than any other state. It seems like blue states are constantly Putting red states on life support yet. We got these little red states that ain't contributing nothing But they are definitely taking up a lot of money, you know, it is interesting because the governor in California I don't know if you caught this but governor Newsom was talking about just holding on to his dollars because California is what they call a donor state and  meaning that they actually contribute more than they take from the federal government. And then you can go down south to states like Louisiana, who are broke, and so they need California to pay in. So it is so interesting that we are so concerned about whether or not we are pushing certain ideologies, but let me talk about some of these. I've got a few questions.

Unauthorized drone incursions are increasing in frequency, particularly in proximity to sensitive sites, such as military installations, nuclear power plants, which we just mentioned,  and airports. Between 2022 and 2024, North American Aerospace Defense Command and the Department of Defense documented more than 600 unauthorized drone overflights of U.S. military facilities. Public reporting has also noted concerning incidents near critical infrastructure, such as the appearance of low altitude drones over nuclear facilities  and near commercial airport perimeters in multiple states. So I think all of you are perfectly capable of answering my question, so I'll just leave it open. But my first question is, what are some of the direct impacts of unauthorized drone overflights at military facilities?  airports, and maritime ports.

Thank you very much. I think first and foremost, obviously, there's with each incident, the potential for there being some sort of a catastrophic event. Thankfully, as mentioned, we haven't seen that in the United States as yet, but we have seen it overseas as the topic of this overall hearing, how drone warfare abroad is changing, you know, the situation at home.  But even without those catastrophic events, each time one of these incidents occurs, it erodes public trust as well. It also damages the public perception around the positive utility of drones. At AUVSI, we represent companies that focus on the defense against drones, but we also represent dozens of drone operators that are doing life-saving critical missions every day.  whether it's for public safety or package delivery or other really important things for our economy and public safety, all of that could go away if there's a very terrible drone incident that occurs in the United States.  And again, as we've talked about today, this is no longer a technology problem. The technology is in place. These three companies, as well as others, all have the ability to offer the protection to all the different sites that you listed. But Congress hasn't updated the rules since 2018. Obviously, the landscape and the threat environment has changed dramatically.

I think also when we say counter drone or counter UAS, I think sometimes that's a misnomer.  These systems provide air domain awareness. They are a safety tool. More than anything else, they provide safety to the general public, to any of the events that we have. The security element is there in mitigation, which is also necessary.

Everybody's technology is in, everybody's system's an amalgamation of various different groups of those technologies, but no, not everybody has the availability that, and I've spoken with multiple law enforcement agencies who don't even know these technologies exist, much less have access to them.  So, I think back to what everybody here has been saying, first off, do we need to give, and I really appreciate him pointing out that I think there's a fear about delegating counter UAS authority down to certain agencies because everybody just assumes that that means we're going to be, you know, shooting down drones or taking down drones, and that's not necessarily the case. It is the identification of whether or not these are hostile or non-hostile.  There's, again, we've said it enough, but I'm going to say it one more time. It's not a technology problem. They exist.

You sort of have a sense of where the pulse of America is. There's been a lot of changes announced and talked about in Washington. Do you see from your customers much reaction to that, either to the talk of tariffs or the one big beautiful bill? Do consumers or businesses, are they changing their plans because of that?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 56.579, "text": " So if you look on the consumer side, in our 70 million consumers who engage with the economy every day, and they send through their accounts and spend the cash and everything, about $4 trillion, $5 trillion a year, that grew up 4% plus the second quarter, 25, or the second quarter, 24. So because they're employed and because of wage growth, and that's not every single consumer.  But in the large, in the main, they are continuing to grow and spend more. And that helps the economy. And so you're seeing in some of the moderate-income households, there's a little bit of shuffling, moving around to different things. You're seeing people trade from one thing to another, less planes, more cruises earlier. That's leveling out now. A lot more going to movies because the movies are good. But at the end of the day,  they're spending discretionary necessary about the same percentage they traditionally spent. They've got money in their accounts, they're employed, and the wage growth has been relatively strong. And, you know, so they're in pretty good shape. The credit quality is good. They have equity in their homes. They're low rate financing in the mortgage. So consumer is pretty good.  When you go to small businesses, that's more the question, small, medium-sized businesses, because the interest rate environment hits them harder because they borrow on lines of credit short-term for a lot of their activities. And that rate went up substantially. And then you think about the, if I'm a $100 million company, a $50 million company here in North Carolina, and I'm engaging in the world finance, I'm importing goods and manufacturing them, further manufacturing them, selling them.  You know, it got pretty interesting here trying to figure out all the trade and tariffs. I think the certainty on the tax rate helps them, meaning the big beautiful bill passing and the tax rate. That's a very good thing. The alternative would not have been good if their tax rates would have changed. A satisfactory resolution to the trade so that they could learn the rules of the road over the next 30, 60, 90 days and get their plans for next year put together.  I think ultimately we're going to have to satisfy a resolution on immigration and population growth because at the end of the day, what I'm hearing more from construction companies, farming companies, and travel and entertainment type companies is I'm starting to worry about, I'm starting to struggle with labor availability at any price.

This quarter was a record in the company's history. And we're saying we're going to grow from that record to 15.5 to 15.7 in two more quarters, a third quarter and a fourth quarter.  That embeds in it the rate cuts in the market that are expected by the market. We don't, we only show it that way. If you have rate cuts over, above that, that would hurt that number, but it would still grow, frankly. And so, and that, the good thing about that is because the great loan deposit growth, 7% loan growth, 4% deposit growth over the last year, that's in the system. That's capitalized in, I mean, that's here. It doesn't go away. And as that continues to stay and we add to it,  What you're starting to see is that sets us up great for next year for further NII growth and further EPS growth. So, this quarter was the trickiest quarter to get through because year over year, we finally got some NII growth, but year over year, the market's business doing strong, so expense growth is a little more robust.

But if, in fact, President Trump gets his wish, as is his right under law, to appoint a new chair who will be more in line with his views, he said he thinks the interest rate really should be at 1%, or even below that.

One is, you're absolutely right. In May of next year, the term of the current Fed chair ends after being reappointed. And it's the right of the elected president to appoint the next successor and go through Congress. And I think in that dialogue around that, there'll be a lot of dialogue about, OK, how do you set interest rates? What do you think about interest rates? Because the Fed is an independent agency. And they're meant to be outside the purview of the executive and the Congress. They are called to task, and they're monitored, and they're reviewed, and all the things.  But the reality was it was set up to be independent, so our central bank in America was independent. So I think no matter who gets in, they're going to look at it and have to look at the facts and make a decision. Because if you drop rates too far, inflation may kick up, and then you're going to have to raise them back quickly. On the other hand, if you think the prior Fed has been slow to lower rates, you might lower them faster. Our team believes that the Fed will lower rates in the second half of next year by 100 basis points. No change until then, because inflation is still going through the system. That brings the Fed funds rate down closer to three.  which they think is probably more of a long-term rate, and frankly is more similar to what we had for most of American history. What's been unusual is the period after the global financial crisis, a very low interest rate structure. That is really not a good place to be, honestly. We'd rather have a higher interest rate structure, a little more inflation, a little more robust economic growth.

So we're using those tools to prepare the information, pull it together, because it could take text and manipulate it and put it into the forms and the capabilities  So that's a big thing in front of us. We've done 500 or 700 pitches so far, and that's cranking up. We see it in employee self-help. If you had a computer that went down at Bank of America, you can click on Erica for Employees, and a chatbot will take you all the way through the placement of your computer process, and it will involve no people, and you'll get the computer delivered to you. So, you know, that's how we took that Save Erica model.  you know, 20 million consumers use 200 million times a quarter and turn it internal. And so there's all these applications, and we think it has high application for the services business that Bank of America's in and the ability to keep doing work. And in the end of the day, we'll have teammates who will harness it and take it and use it to their advantage to make themselves even more successful. So, you know, we talk to teammates, we say, embrace this, let's drive it, and then let's figure out,  you know, what jobs are, what job you're going to do, but you're going to need this to be able to do any job in this company."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 747.866, "text": "As you move forward with artificial intelligence, is it changing what you're looking for in the people coming in the door, the entry level people?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 756.419, "text": " We're just in the process of bringing in our 2,000 plus kids, new hires that just started I think this week.

We love them. They're coming in.  The point I'm making is there is a group that has to use computer skills and data skills and that. That's one set of things. But everybody has to be able to use AI to help them be a better employee at Bank of America.

You've said that you're moving towards stablecoin, as some other banks are as well. You saw Mr. Bailey, who's the governor of the Bank of England, really said that might have systemic risks, because it takes some of the money out of the banking system. You'd be better off going a different direction. Are you worried about systemic risks from stablecoin?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 817.625, "text": " So one of the questions, and I think what Mr. Bailey was talking about, is a question I think the banking system, the United States, the policymakers have to think about, which is think about the money market mutual fund. About $6 trillion of deposit banks moved to money market mutual funds. And their utility was to invest in short-term deposits, treasury bonds, et cetera, commercial paper. They can't invest long-term. So their ability to help the economy is really a limited amount. That $6 trillion is outside the system.  If you said we're going to take the $18 trillion or whatever is in the bank yesterday, another $6 trillion out, you have to think through the policy ramifications, because to keep it stable, you have to have it invest in a very narrow place. And I think that's what Mr. Bailey was talking about. I think that dialogue is going on.  There's another side of this, which means those deposits will come back in the system if we hold the deposits effectively in escrow custody for our customers who are out engaging stable coins. So I think there's a lot of turns in the track between where we are today and where we might be on this. Our view is pretty simple.  10 years ago, you would have said, the clients don't need a thing called Zelle. And now they use it twice as much as they use checks. And it is used more times than the amount of checks written by our consumers, the amount of cash transactions taken cash, all the M's. So it's become the dominant payment network for consumers outside of card. That didn't exist 10 years ago. So we got to have the consumers adopt this. If they want it, we'll build it, and they'll use it. And if it's a way to transact,  will be there to help them transact. We think, you know, small bounce, cross-border transfers, in-app sort of patient purchases, all these types of things, applications for it. But at the end of the day, it's our customer who needs to say, I want to move money. I want to move money into euros. I want to move money into stablecoin.

But I want to start with everything happening in Washington, D.C. when it comes to the Federal Reserve, because we got to  bit of mixed information from different sources about the fate of Jay Powell. We saw markets react, of course, as potentially they would react if he were to step down or be forced out of that role. From an economics perspective, how do you look at what's happening to Fed Chair Jay Powell?  Well, it's unfortunate because, as we know, there is no such thing as a free lunch. But the closest thing that we have to a free lunch in economics is a politically independent central bank. Going back to research from the late 1980s by Larry Summers, friend of Bloomberg TV,  We know that independent central banks tend to deliver lower, more stable inflation with very little cost in terms of foregone GDP growth. Speaking of GDP growth, as Katie mentioned from the Beige Book, reading from the PDF here,  Economic activity increased slightly from late May through early June. Now, when we break it down and look at the 12 different Federal Reserve districts, five reported slight or modest gains. Five had flat activity. The remaining two districts noted modest declines in activity. Rotating to the labor market, employment increased very slightly overall.  Now, something to keep in mind is that when we're digesting labor market data, some folks might have breathed a sigh of relief because the unemployment rate ticked down. But as we're hearing from this soft data, employment's increasing just very slightly. And it's concentrated in just a few districts. Part of the reason the unemployment rate is ticking down is because there's relatively less labor supply. So we're starting to see  some of the details of the hard data matching up with the somewhat softer soft data that we're getting from the Beige Book right now."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 287.802, "text": "Exactly.

I don't rule out anything, but I think it's highly unlikely unless he has to leave for fraud. So we know that there's been a kerfuffle over the renovations with the Federal Reserve. It feels like perhaps the president is leaving that door open."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 322.242, "text": " It does look that way. The thing to keep in mind, though, I think, is that a lot of the discussion about renovations, a lot of this idea about fraud, is really just red herring. It's an attempt to find a cause that gives the president the statutory authority to remove the Fed chairman from office. What he really wants is lower interest rates.  We what he really wants is lower debt service costs. But the thing is if he were to attempt to remove the Fed chairman markets would start to feel that acid reflux. They would start as we saw with interest rates 10 years selling off on this you know temporary news the flash headlines that the president was considering firing Powell.  It's very likely, actually, the case that if the Fed chairman were to be fired so that he could be replaced with someone to deliver the president's preferred lower interest rates, debt servicing costs would actually rise as the term structure steepens. It's the exact opposite of what he says he wants. Well, let's take a listen to what President Trump said earlier today. This was in the Oval Office. We were airing it live. He was along with Crown Prince and Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bahrain. This is on Fed Chair Jay Powell.  He's not doing the right job. We should be saving a trillion dollars a year in interest, you know, when he talks about cost. We should be saving, think of it, a trillion dollars a year. Add that with the tariffs and everything else, but he just doesn't want it. He's a knucklehead.  the president calling the Fed chair a knucklehead. We should remind everybody that the president was the person during his first term who nominated Fed Chair Jay Powell for his first term. He was then reappointed and confirmed during President Biden's administration. What do you make of that trillion dollar figure? Is that on your radar at all?  Well, it's just completely off. If you were to install a Fed chairman who has the objective, the stated objective, of essentially monetizing the national debt, as it sounds like the president wants to do, as he calls the current Fed chairman a numbskull or a knucklehead or a total stiff,  As that happens, bond investors need to account for additional inflation compensation, a higher average expected inflation rate over the entire rest of the term structure. So you would see maybe some rate cuts.  additionally priced in, you might even see a lower two-year bond yield. But if you think it was a little bit jarring to see the 30-year breach 5 percent just yesterday, now 5.06 or wherever it is, we would definitely see the 10-year shooting back up about 5 percent. So you would see just a total rejection of that idea. The actual debt servicing costs would not come down by any trillions of dollars."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 486.368, "text": " Could you build a case for cutting rates here, though? You think about inflation. We got CPI yesterday. That was exactly in line. You got PPI this morning unchanged on the monthly figure. We haven't quite seen the labor market weakness, but there have been some anecdata to suggest that maybe that's coming down the pike. I mean, you add it all together, could you build that case?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 509.234, "text": " I think that the simplest case for cutting rates right now is that basically rates are currently where they were when we had nominal GDP growth of about 6 to 7 percent. Right. Nominal GDP growth being the dollar value of the economic activity in a year.  And currently we're running at a nominal GDP growth rate of about half that, the bulk of which is inflation. So should rates be as restrictive when there was twice as much economic activity and growth in economic activity?  Frankly, you would get people on the committee, including folks like Chris Waller and Mickey Bowman, who'd say, no, we could start delivering rate cuts perhaps as soon as July. But when you see anecdata from the Beige Book today, where the most pervasive and the most concentrated set of answers in that anecdote is that around the country, you're seeing relatively hot price increases. You're seeing seven  of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts saying price growth is at least moderate, five saying it's modest, mostly similar to the previous report. It's not like we're seeing any softening of price pressures. You still have those pipeline price pressures. We're not seeing softening, but we're not seeing the price pressures go up or prices go up like many economists thought three months ago they would as a result of tariffs. Why is that?  So we're starting to see some offsets, right? So some softening of shelter costs, you see some drag from airfares. But the things that are touched most acutely and most precisely by tariffs, things like appliances, home furnishings, clothing, those are seeing rising, in fact, accelerating prices.  Is that because they're a smaller part of our economy? We're a services economy. So we're not necessarily seeing the impact of these increase of prices of goods in the headline numbers. That's part of it. But the Fed is still looking to prevent inflation expectations from becoming unanchored. A lot of the goods are things that we interact with very regularly. We interact with  the grocery store very regularly. It's a notable development when you have to replace an appliance and you realize it's going to cost twice as much as you expected. Those are things that weigh heavily on Americans. So even though it's the case that yes, rent accounts for a larger share of their total spend than something like appliances, a lot of the time your rent is just deducted from your checking account.  It resets every couple of years when you sign a new lease. For homeowners, it's the sort of thing that's very stable over a 30-year mortgage. So when inflation expectations are part of the game for the Federal Reserve when it comes to setting rates, they are going to be paying more attention to goods than one might suspect."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 670.492, "text": " And I mean, to that point, something I always wonder is how interest rate sensitive this economy truly is, because you think about home, buying a home, mortgage rates. OK, you interact with that not too often. Car payments, maybe you interact with that a little bit more.  One of the explanations for why we weren't seeing inflation or activity or spending cool down when we had such high rates, and I suppose we still do on a relative basis, is basically that this economy isn't as sensitive as it was to interest rates. Does that argument hold water with you?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 703.668, "text": " That still does hold. So yes, the U.S. economy is relatively insulated from the effects of higher rates. And part of that is because homeowners locked in mortgage rates that were below 4 percent. So it's still the average mortgage rate on all mortgages that are outstanding in the U.S. economy is just a touch above 4 percent right now. Nothing even close to the mortgage rates, you know, around 7 percent that are offered for new mortgages.  So the transmission of monetary policy into the real economy is relatively slow. But with home price appreciation slowing pretty dramatically, we expect just full year growth of about 1% for home prices, you will start to see more material slowing in rents, in owner's equivalents of rents, and you also are starting to see softening auto prices, which is a consequence of persistently higher auto loan rates."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 755.626, "text": " And Tim, you mentioned that I anchor this show in the morning.

What do we know about Kevin Hassett, what his stances  And how that might translate into a Fed chair, Kevin Hassett."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 788.134, "text": "Kevin Hassett has been a very vocal supporter of the president. He's been a reliable alternative voice coming from the administration, making the rounds on Sunday shows. Most of his experience, though, is more so in tax policy, which is why it was useful to have him in the White House.  helping to shepherd across the one big beautiful bill. He's a little bit more difficult to read in the context of monetary policy. Kevin Warsh has his experience as a member of the Board of Governors during the George W. Bush administration, and so it should be easier to get a read on him.  What's difficult, though, and why it's a little bit tough to say what we'd expect from an outsider at this point, now 20 years basically removed from the job as Kevin Warsh is, is that he was very critical of the Federal Reserve for maintaining especially low interest rates from the global financial crisis through basically 2018. He was very critical. But he's basically interviewing for a job where he's going to be asked to cut rates into an economic expansion.  And so there's a little bit of intellectual inconsistency between his criticism of the Fed as an institution and the job that he's interviewing for. So I think to sort of square the circle between candidates, Kevin Hassett might be someone who is easier to put into that role. But I don't think that it's necessarily a mortal lock that he would be an easy confirmation in the Senate. He's someone who's been very critical of the Fed and its forecasting failures.  But this is someone who published Dow 36,000 on the eve of the bursting of the tech bubble, and so he would certainly come under fire for his own forecasting failures 25 years ago. Well, we did hit Dow 36,000 a few years ago, so he ended up being right just a couple decades of timing.

And you think about the sentiment in the market right now. Is that what we should expect, that misses will be much more punished than maybe they have been?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1053.726, "text": "Yeah, and I think you said the key term, and that is guidance. So misses to the outlook are especially important because the market is priced to assume a beat to the current, right? And this is really tricky because the consensus was so low coming into this earnings season that it's inevitable that these companies are  going to beat extremely low expectations from the sell-side consensus. Yet at the same time, financials, on a relative price-to-book basis, are trading at their peak levels in the last five years. So very, very expensive stocks, relative to the recent past anyway, contrast with very low expectations. What that means is the market expectation is very different than the analyst community expectation. And the market expectation is really about the future.  It's about a much greater return of capital to shareholders likely to come from this group. It's about deregulation, ultimately removing the so-called shackles of the financial sector, allowing for faster growth. So to the degree that any of those assumptions are questioned, that creates the risk. It's about the future. Are we going to actually sustain these new assumptions for much faster growth coming out of financials or not?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1121.847, "text": " Gina Martin-Adams, Chief Equity Strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence, joining us here in the Bloomberg Businessweek studio.

We do check markets all day long here. Bloomberg has been a volatile trading session. Right now, we have got the Dow, the S&P, NASDAQ. They are all advancing, all eyes on Washington. Bloomberg Television and Radio, we got you covered. President Trump denying that he is seeking to remove Fed Chair Jay Powell.  saying to reporters this morning, quote, no, we're not planning on doing anything. Stocks initially sold off, rebounded. Right now we have got the Dow, the S&P, NASDAQ in the green, should point out that the NASDAQ 100 index does, however, remain lower. So here's where we stand. S&P up eight right now, 6251. At one point this morning, we saw the S&P dip to as low as 6201.  You'll recall that yesterday trading at a record 6,300 on the S&P. Right now up one-tenth of 1%.

I'm Charlie Pellett. That is a Bloomberg Business Flash.  Hey, thanks so much for that update, Charlie. Do appreciate it. Well, the second batch of big banks reported earnings today. There was a theme market volatility sparked by the trade war leading to record quarters for traders. Goldman Stock Traders posted the largest revenue haul in Wall Street history. Morgan Stanley Stock Traders scored their best second quarter on record. And Bank of America traders also posted a record second quarter. Watching all of this closely.  Ken Leon, Director of Equity Research at CFRA Research. He joins us from Florida. So record quarters for trading across the board today, yet the stock reaction to the downside. Why is that?  Well, it's great to be here. And when you look at the global US banks, they performed very strongly. What we did see was not only trading, but the elevated markets means that fee income across many different businesses like asset management, wealth management, other services generated substantial year over year growth.  What we are also seeing is how the capital markets can be the delta for getting stronger growth and also higher estimates expected from the street looking ahead, both for revenue and earnings. Those that are more balanced or exposed to Main Street America, consumer and small business are likely to see much slower growth and some risk of kind of sluggish demand in the future.  I think that's really the difference between the outsized significant performance of Goldman Sachs, strong growth for Morgan Stanley, and then those that were kind of in between were the JP Morgans and then Bank of America, which didn't fire on oil cylinders. That's the difference."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1348.36, "text": " But Kent still, I mean, when zooming out from just today's action, even though, I mean, Goldman only being up half a percent after posting a record quarter when it comes to trading, what is the driver of these financial shares? Is it the yield curve? Is it actually the numbers that we get in the earnings report? Is it something else? Because I feel like I go through this puzzle at least four times a year when we get these earnings."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1375.225, "text": " Yeah, lucky for you, four times for me, it's every day. And we've been overweighted, the financial sector really since last November. And the large banks are in the top 10 of that sector. And what we've seen even in the second quarter or year to date is  tremendous performance, more than two times the S&P 500, for diversified banks. But that's not the point. The key point is, where do they go from here? We think the delta, not only for the rest of this year, but really these stocks are going to be priced on 2026 earnings, is going to be how they do into next year. Obviously, two to four rate cuts,  some easing on the regulatory framework, and then also some opening up in the capital markets for investment banking. That's going to help these banks. When you look at them, you know, in terms of PE multiples or what Gina was talking about, the overall market, they have to earn into these valuations or multiples.  When we look at more conservative metrics, which a lot of bank analysts look at, because they're a conservative lot, such as price to net tangible book value, they're pretty expensive. But I think it's earnings growth and what that does in terms of confidence that they can still have upside over the next year or two. That's the key.  Ken, I'd be remiss if we didn't ask you about the drama with regard to Fed chair Jay Powell. The reports emerging early today that he would be fired by the president and the president was seriously considering doing that. We saw a market reaction from the equity side and from the fixed income side. And then just a little later in the morning, we heard from the president who denied that he would do that imminently. Yet there are certainly concerns about the way that the president feels about the Fed chair. We all know that.  What would it mean for banks if this were to happen? Would it mean anything? So I'm a global director and I look at markets all over the world. And also when you look at the bond market and really the 10 and 30 year treasury, the Fed really matters. It's independence, the respect and responsibility of its two mandates.  for inflation and full employment. I just think this is color or drama. You know, Jay Powell is highly regarded. And the other issue, of course, is when his term is up next year, likely probably to retire. But he could stay on for a few more years as as a governor. OK, so what would happen, though, if he were forced out?  I don't see that scenario. You really don't know. But, you know, at the end of the day, even if even if even if they were to find some potential. Look, the president has targeted the handling of the Fed renovation. What if there's something there and he can push him out through that?  So President Trump's going to get a dovish Fed chairman in part. Nobody's really hawkish today. The data will suggest possibly a slower US economy rest of this year, which is why we're much more positive on the delta of the capital markets, not Main Street America, to help large banks' earnings. So we're just going to have to see. But overall, Fed's going to be independent.  Of course, we're going to get rate cuts either way."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 24, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1589.183, "text": " I have a thought as to what would happen to the banks if Jerome Powell were forced out. You would see a lot of volatility, and the banks would probably trade it, Ken. And that brings me back to all of these trading records that we saw, at least for Goldman, and then these bumper quarters that the other big banks put up. Of course, we know what happened in April. We had Liberation Day at the start of the month, and then we had the walk back. And it seems like that was a big boost for these banks. And the question that comes about is,  How sustainable is that? When you think about all of this revenue that's being made in training, how sustainable is that?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 25, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1626.258, "text": " It's not the trading. You really need to focus on financial sponsors, which are the large private equity firms. They're sitting on $2 trillion of companies they own they have to monetize in some way and also afford the investment bankers to get that job done. That's where I would really look as a delta that we haven't seen really in the numbers and size as it relates to mergers and acquisitions, equity underwriting, or other forms of transactions.  look to lower rates, making it more appealing to valuation for both public and private transactions, that's going to be a bonanza for the large banks. Ken Leon, Director of Equity Research at CFRA. Thanks so much, Ken. Good to see you this afternoon.  As we mentioned, Bank of America traders posted a record second quarter as the company reaped the benefits of volatile markets and net interest income top analyst estimates. For more, we sent things on over to David Weston. He's standing by with Bank of America chair and CEO, Brian Moynihan. Hey, David. Thanks so much, Tim. For our Bloomberg audiences worldwide, this is Bloomberg. I'm David Weston, and this is Brian Moynihan, who's the chair CEO of Bank of America. Brian, thank you so much for being back with us. Really appreciate it on this busy day for you.  It's great to be here, David. Good to see you again. So let me start with one of the favorite questions I have for you, because you at Bank of America have a window into so much of America, consumers and businesses of all sizes. You sort of have a sense of where the pulse of America is. There's been a lot of changes announced and talked about in Washington. Do you see from your customers much reaction to that, either to the talk of tariffs or the one big beautiful bill? To consumers or businesses, are they changing their plans because of that?  So if you look on the consumer side, in our 70 million consumers who engage with the economy every day, and they send through their accounts and spend the cash and everything, about $4 trillion, $5 trillion a year, that grew up 4% plus.  the second quarter 25 or the second quarter 24. So they because they're employed and because wage growth and that's not every single consumer. It's but in the large in the main they are continuing to grow and spend more. And that's helps the economy. And so you're seeing in some of the  moderate income households. There's a little bit of shuffle moving around to different things. You're seeing people trade from one thing to another. Less planes more cruises earlier. That's leveling out now. A lot more going to movies because the movies are good. But the other day they're spending discretionary necessary about the same percentage they traditionally spent. They've got money in their accounts. They're employed and the wage growth has been relatively strong. And so they're in pretty good shape. The credit quality is good.  They have equity in their homes. They have low rate financing in their mortgage. So consumers are pretty good. When you go to small businesses, that's more the question, small, medium-sized businesses, because the interest rate environment hits them harder because they borrow on lines of credit short term for a lot of their activities. And that rate went up substantially. And then you think about the, if I'm a $100 million company, a $50 million company here in North Carolina, and I'm engaging in a world  finance. I'm importing goods and manufacturing them further manufacturing and selling them. You know it got pretty interesting here trying to figure out all the trade and tariffs. I think the certainty on a tax rate helps them meaning the big beautiful bill passing and the tax rate. That's a very good thing. The alternative would not been good if their tax rates would change a satisfactory resolution to the trade so that they could learn the rules of the road over the next 30 60 90 days and get their plans for next year put together. And I think ultimately they're going to  We've got a satisfactory resolution on immigration and population growth, because at the end of the day, what I'm hearing more from construction companies, farming companies, and travel and entertainment type companies is, I'm starting to worry about, I'm starting to struggle with labor availability at any price. And that's not, that we gotta make sure they have the workers because they will supply a great service economy and continue to grow.  One of the things you reported today was net interest income, which is really important to all banks, but particularly Bank of America, and just steady growth that you're showing in that. How sensitive are you to the rates set by the Fed? If that comes down substantially, does that affect Bank of America much?  So embedded in our estimates, so we've told the world that this quarter we had $14.8 billion in net interest income. And that is the fourth straight quarter of growth and came off the floor last year. This quarter, when I was talking to you, was the lowest it's been. This quarter was a record in the company's history. And we're saying we're going to grow from that record to 15.5 to 15.7 in two more quarters, a third quarter and a fourth quarter.  that embeds in it the rate cuts in the market that are expected by the market. We don't we only show it that way. If you have rate cuts over above that that would hurt that number. But it would still grow frankly. And so and that the good thing about that is because a great loan deposit growth 7 percent loan growth 4 percent deposit growth over the last year. That's in the system that's capitalized. I mean that's here. It doesn't go away. And as that continues to stay and we add to it  what you're starting to see is that sets us up great for next year for further NII growth and further EPS growth. So this quarter was the trickiest quarter to get through because year over year we finally got some NII growth but year over year the market's business doing strong so expense growth is a little more robust. That'll get in line and then you'll see NII drop to the bottom line and it will set up for 2026 with even more growth.  When you talk about 2026, one of the things we're going to have is, in all likelihood, a new Fed chair. There's been a lot of talk, even today in Washington, about the Fed chair. And you've said you believe in an independent Fed. But if, in fact, President Trump gets his wish, as is his right under law, to appoint a new chair who will be more in line with his views, he said he thinks the interest rate really should be at 1%, or even below that. Is that good for Bank of America? Is that good for the economy?  Well, let me make two things. One is, you're absolutely right. In May of next year, the term of the current Fed chair ends after being reappointed. And it's the right of the elected president to appoint the next successor and go through Congress. And I think in that dialogue around that, there'll be a lot of dialogue about, OK, how do you set interest rates? What do you think about interest rates? Because the Fed is an independent agency, and they're meant to be outside the purview of the executive and the Congress. They are called to task, and they're monitored, and they're reviewed, and all the things.  But the reality was it was set up to be independent so that our central bank in America was independent. So I think no matter who gets in, they're going to look at it and have to look at the facts and make a decision. Because if you drop rates too far, inflation may kick up, and then you're going to have to raise them back quickly. On the other hand, if you think the prior Fed has been slow to lower rates, you might lower them faster. Our team believes that the Fed will lower rates in the second half of next year by 100 basis points, no change until then because inflation is still going through the system. If that brings the Fed funds rate down closer to three,  which they think is probably more of a long-term rate and, frankly, is more similar to what we had for most of American history. What's been unusual is the period after the global financial crisis, a very low interest rate structure. That is really not a good place to be, honestly. We'd rather have a higher interest rate structure, a little more inflation, a little more robust economic growth. So I think everybody has to be a little careful about keeping that engine going, because if this engine fails, the whole world fails.  You also reported increased loans from Bank of America, which is good news for you. Tell us about your competition for that. We now have private credit really coming into that area substantially. There's talk that maybe that would be peaking. Is that the way you see it?  Well, I think that if so, if you think about all our loans, a trillion one of loans, say half from the consumer. And so there's not that competition's always been there. Half of what goes on for consumer lending goes on outside the regulated bank industry. That's been true for a long period of time. We saw growth across all the segments. We feel very good about that.  We go to commercial, the private credit affects sort of the leverage finance and some of the areas. And it's been an effective competitor. It's grown. I think we in the industry and we in a company, Bank of America, have come back with a way of operating we think is consistent with our credit quality, consistent with who our customers and will also deliver a competitive product. And we grew commercial loans, leave aside the market-based business. We grew commercial loans, I think, 70%, excluding the Cree office that we are running down still.  in the middle market, which is as strong as anybody, and we feel very good about the credit quality of those loans. But more importantly, we feel good about the 30-, 50-, 70-year corporate relationships we have. And if they want a different kind of financing, we'll bring it and take it to the market for them, like we've always done.  You also had a great quarter in terms of trading. Give us a sense about where you're going with your trading activities and your investment bank. In the past, you've added more balance sheet strength to that. You've come up in that. Do you plan to keep doing more of that?  Yeah. And so Jim Demar and the global markets business which is the trading business as you call it. They are up 15 percent year over year. Both fixed income and equities are up. And he has had 13 straight quarters like it is of year over year quarter comparison growth. And so there's some ebb and flows in that business. But this quarter started off a little interesting with Liberation Day. And I think the first  you know for the biggest days ever. And equity stock trading occurred in the first week of April or something like that. So it was a pretty wild time. But over the course of the quarter it got more stable and they made it. We have given him more capital and more balance sheet him in a team more importantly. And that team under his guidance has delivered on it is getting a good return on it. And  We have lots of capital. If he can put it to work, there'll be more of it. The trick is he's also got to use it efficiently and get that return on tangible common equity return allocated capital straight. When you go to investment banking, look, April was kind of quiet, especially on the M&A side for us. It came back and you saw us  You know, as recently as three or four weeks ago, we thought we'd do 1.2 billion. We did 1.4 billion. And with pipelines full, Matthew Coder and team are out there driving at it. We did. We lost some deals to other people in the M&A. We were on the wrong side of the trade. That happens. But the reality is what really changed over the course of the months was the financing side kicked in.  That's three quarters of our revenue, and that was good, and that's why the revenue came up. And that team does a good job, and there's lots of places to grow. That is going to be much more dependent upon the IPO markets being open, the M&A markets, the M&A taking place. And I think with stability, again, back to the tax bill, some trade stability.  and then frankly deregulation you're going to see I think that activity keep kicking in as we move through 2025 and 26 which will be good for the economy because it creates a lot of activity investment changes in businesses and all those things that we expect to see.  You took time out from your earnings announcement to really focus on artificial intelligence, something you have been talking about for quite some time and adopting, for example, with Erica that you have. Give us a sense of how that's changing the business of Bank of America, for example, on the expense side. Does it really lead to saving some costs? So, at the end of the day,  The artificial intelligence as we know it is an extension of a series of technology capabilities that allow us to take work and have machines do the work and people and enhance the people's ability to do more work and do more things and spend more time on things that aren't capable of going through that.  AI just gives you a different attack surface, for lack of a better term. In the past, we had 300,000 people 15 years ago in our company. Today, we have 212,000 people. The company's bigger, complex, more transactions. From that time, our digital logins were probably, I don't know, 10, 20 million a quarter, and we felt good about it. They were a billion a month, just to give you a sense. So think of all the investment to do that. But that digitization was customers doing things on their own at 10 o'clock at night and 7 o'clock in the morning, and that allowed us to,  save our time for our people to go out and help customers solve difficult problems. What AI, the place that we think AI has real help is in the preparation of our relationship management force and our small business bankers, our business bankers, our commercial bankers, our wealth management, our investment bankers, allows them to be much more prepared. So we're using those tools to prepare the information, pull it together, because it can take text and manipulate it and put it into the forms and the capabilities  So that's a big thing in front of us. We've done 500 or 700 pitches so far, and that's cranking up. We see it in employee self-help. If you had a computer that went down at Bank of America, you can click on Erica for Employees, and a chatbot will take you all the way through the placement of your computer process, and it will involve no people, and you'll get the computer delivered to you. So that's how we took that same Erica model that  20 million consumers used 200 million times a quarter and turned it internal. And so there's all these applications, and we think it has high application for the services business that Bank of America's in and the ability to keep doing work. And at the end of the day, we'll have teammates who will harness it and take it and use it to their advantage to make themselves even more successful. So we talk to teammates, we say, embrace this, let's drive it, and then let's figure out  you know, what jobs are, what job you're going to do, but you're going to need this to be able to do any job in this company. As you move forward with artificial intelligence, is it changing what you're looking for in the people coming in the door, the entry-level people?  We're just in the process of bringing in our 2,000 plus kids, new hires that just started I think this week. So think about that, 2,000 kids arrived, 1% of applications, less than 1% were accepted. So we had 190,000 applications and around 2,000 people coming in. So we're getting the best of the brightest. We love them. They're coming in.  The point I'm making is there is a group that has to use computer skills and data skills and that that's one set of things. But everybody has to be able to use A.I. to help them be a better employee at Bank of America. So as you think about that you know every teammate and I have high confidence kids coming out of colleges are going to be a lot better A.I. than you and I might be David. But we'll catch up to him someday.  One last question, Brian. You've said that you're moving towards stablecoin, as some other banks are as well. You saw Mr. Bailey, who's the governor of the Bank of England, really said that might have systemic risks, because it takes some of the money out of the banking system. You're better off going a different direction. Are you worried about systemic risks from stablecoin?  So one of the questions, and I think what Mr. Bailey was talking about, is a question I think the banking system, the United States, the policymakers have to think about, which is think about the money market mutual fund. About $6 trillion of deposit banks moved to money market mutual funds. And their utility was to invest in short-term deposits, treasury bonds, et cetera, commercial paper. They can't invest long-term. So their ability to help the economy is really a limited amount. That $6 trillion is out.  side the system. If you said we're going to take the 18 trillion or whatever the bank is today another six trillion out you have to think through the policy ramifications because to keep it stable you have to have it invest in a very narrow place. I think that's what Mr. Bailey was talking about. I think that dialogue is going on now.  There's another side of this which means those deposits will come back in the system if we hold the deposits effectively in escrow custody for our customers who are out engaging stable coins. So I think there's a lot of turns in the track between where we are today and where we might be on this. We our view is pretty simple.  Ten years ago, you would have said, the clients don't need a thing called Zelle. And now they use it twice as much as they use checks. And it is used more times than the amount of checks written by our consumers, the amount of cash transactions taken cash, all the M's. So it's become the dominant payment network for consumers outside of card.  that didn't exist 10 years ago. So we got to have the consumers adopt this. If they want it we'll build it and they'll use it. And if it's a way to transact we'll be there to help them transact. We think you have small bounce cross-border transfers in app sort of patient purchases all these types of things applications for. But at the end of day it's our customer who needs to say I want to move money. I want to move money into Europe euros. I want to move money into stable coin. So we've got to be able to do both for them.  Brian, great pleasure to talk to you. Thanks again on a busy day for joining us. That is Brian Moynihan. He is chairman and CEO of Bank of America.

We got about an hour and 14 minutes to close of equity trading. But Charlie, who's counting?  Well, we are, because that's what we do here at Bloomberg. We got you covered on the closing bell. Bloomberg Radio and Television and, of course, all those fast-moving developments today that move markets out of Washington, D.C. Lower right around 11 o'clock with the S&P falling to just about 6,201. You'll recall yesterday the S&P was at a record 6,300 briefly.

Powell setting off a short lived tempest in financial markets with volatility mostly quelled after President Trump said he has no plans to fire the central bank chief and was discussing it only in concept. United Airlines reports after the close of trading. I'm charlie pellet. That is a Bloomberg business flash.  Hey, thanks for that update, Charlie. Do appreciate it. Well, as Charlie mentioned, we're watching everything happening out of Washington when it comes to Fed Chair Jay Powell. President Trump denied that he is seeking to remove Fed Chair Jay Powell after raising the idea in a closed door meeting with congressional Republicans that leaked to the media. I want to bring in Michael McKee. He's Bloomberg News international economics and policy correspondent. He joins us from Victor, Idaho.  where he is for the Rocky Mountain Economic Summit. And Mike, I take it there's a lot being talked about among the Federal Reserve bankers who are there, among the pundits who are there. What is the conversation happening in the wake of everything we heard this morning from the president and from reports before the president spoke?  Well, actually, Tim, there's a bit of an eye roll going on with a lot of people because we've been through this so many times with Donald Trump and the whole idea of taco came up again. So nobody was surprised when he came out and denied the earlier reports that he was  ready to fire the president perhaps as early fire the Fed chair perhaps as early as today. But the general feeling has been and we talked about this a lot at dinner last night that the president won't do it because it doesn't get him very far. It would probably as we saw this morning lead to a  steepening of the yield curve, a widening of spreads, the dollar falling, and interest rates would go up rather than down in the markets. And it would just create a lot of confusion and hurt the Fed's credibility. It would also end up in court. So he might try to remove the Fed chair, but it would take many months of legal maneuvering to get that far. And really Powell doesn't have that much longer to go as chair.  You said that there was a little bit of eye rolling because this is sort of a movie that we've seen before. Let's take a listen to the rhetoric from the president just over the last few months when it comes to the chair of the Federal Reserve.  And the fake news is saying, oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad. It would be so bad. I don't know why it would be so bad. So we have a stupid person, frankly, at the Fed. I call him Too Late Powell, because he's always too late. I know within three or four people who I'm going to pick. I mean, he goes out pretty soon, fortunately, because I think he's terrible. I'd love him to resign if he wanted to. He's done a lousy job. Jerome Powell's been very bad for our country. We should have the lowest interest rate on Earth, and we don't.  He just refuses to do it, and yet he's spending $2.5 billion rebuilding the Fed. He's a terrible, he's a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed. We're not planning on doing anything. We're very concerned.  As President Trump over the last few months, his rhetoric around Fed Chair Jay Powell, it's in chronological order. And I want to point people to the part just before the last soundbite where he said he's spending two and a half billion dollars rebuilding the Fed. Mike, is there any there there with this new line of attack when it comes to this renovation?  Well, there are questions about why the renovation has gone up from $1.7 billion to $2.5 billion. And I suppose those are things that could be investigated. And Powell has asked the Fed's inspector general to look into it. The Fed's response so far has been that these plans were approved in 2021. And obviously, right after that, we had a big inflation. And so the costs of everything have gone up.  I'll also argue that a lot of things that the administration is focused on, or some of the administration officials who've tweeted about it are focused on, are things that are actually not in the final plans. And so it doesn't appear that there's a lot there. Is it enough for cause to fire a Fed governor? That would be up for the courts to decide. And as I said, that would take some time. So I don't know that that's a big deal. In that string of  Trump quotes, I would also point to the one where Trump said, I was surprised he was appointed. Well, Trump appointed him as chair."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 28, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 2993.639, "text": " Yeah, good reminder. Tim is eager to make that point. He did also express surprise that Biden re-nominated him, President Biden. I do want to get your thoughts, Mike McKee, on the idea that, OK, his term as Fed chair ends in May 2026. We know that. We also know that his term as Fed governor doesn't end until January 2028. We had Treasury Secretary Scott Bessin join Bloomberg Television  Yes, Ray, and he said that would be very confusing for markets if Powell did stay on as a governor until January 2028. What does the precedent look like there?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 29, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 3029.853, "text": " Well there really isn't a precedent. The closest you can get is back in 1951 the Treasury Fed Accord where the Treasury Department and the Fed agreed the Treasury would handle fiscal policy and the Fed would handle monetary policy. And the Fed chairman at the time stepped down. President Truman appointed a new chair. But the old chair stayed on for a couple of years.  as a governor. But it wasn't a matter of standing up to the administration at the time. He was actually asked to do that to lend his experience. In this case this would be a completely unusual situation. The only close analogy I could come up with would be Paul Volcker who faced a rebellion among his fellow board governors and  And the Reagan White House told him, we think this means you need to go. And he did resign. But it was a kind of different situation than we have right now. So this would be, as Scott Besson said, a completely confusing mess for the markets, particularly if the president appointed someone he's seen as a toady to him that would just try to lower interest rates regardless of economic conditions.  The next thing that would happen would be Governor Powell would offer a speech and it would get massive coverage and the markets would be torn between which ones to believe. It's also, and this is important, Tim and Katie, to realize that the Open Market Committee that sets interest rates selects its own chairman of that committee, and it doesn't have to be the Fed board chairman.  So the president could appoint Kevin Hassett as the Fed board chair, and the Open Market Committee could just keep Jay Powell as its chair. And so interest rates wouldn't be any different than they are right now. All right, Michael McKee, we're going to have to leave it there.

You take away Title X funding from these family planning clinics that provide these cervical cancer screenings for 460,000 women.

Thousands of Americans were lost to fentanyl poisoning. Gay members wreaked havoc in local communities. Young women like Laken Riley, Joyce Nungarara, and Rachel Moran were raped, abused, and murdered at the hands of illegal aliens.  This committee led the way by impeaching Secretary Mayorkas for his willful and systematic refusal to enforce longstanding immigration laws, laws passed and amended over the years by bipartisan majorities in Congress. The American people also emphatically rejected the open border policies at the ballot box last November. What is not known by many,  And what will be highlighted today at this hearing is that the Biden-Harris administration could not have executed an open-door border policy on its own. They needed help. And that help came from non-governmental agencies funded by the federal government. These groups that receive billions in taxpayer funding would prove instrumental in helping the Biden-Harris administration process  and release a historic number of illegal aliens into our country. Under a DHS program called the Emergency Food and Shelter Humanitarian Program, EFSPH, which later became the Shelter and Service Program, FEMA provided grants to numerous NGOs, many of whom are operating at the southwest border. These groups spent billions of taxpayers' dollars  given to them by the Biden-Harris administration to provide all types of benefits to illegal aliens, those individuals who were recently released from DHS custody. Our taxpayer dollars were spent on purchasing tens of thousands of nights in hotel rooms for illegal aliens, instead of using existing ICE detention facilities to house those detained individuals.  The Biden-Harris administration sent taxpayer dollars to NGOs to put them in hotels at the cost, again, of hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of those contracts, in many cases without any ICE supervision. Even worse, our taxpayer dollars were used to form the final link in the cartel's human smuggling operation, paying to help illegal aliens travel to their preferred destinations.  Chicago, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, or other destinations of choice. Jansen Owen, then the chief of the Border Patrol Del Rio sector, told the committee in an official interview ICE would then turn over illegal aliens over to NGOs for them to travel to wherever they were going to go while awaiting their hearing.  Recent studies have shown that illegal aliens who pass through the doors of these NGOs at the border ended up in effectively every congressional district across the country. Many of the NGOs served as a launching pad for mass illegal immigration. The abuse was so widespread that even the Biden-Harris administration, the NGOs themselves, couldn't deny what's happening. In June 2022, when DHS officials said,  that the department will continue to closely coordinate with and support NGOs to facilitate the movement of any individual encountered at the southwest border. John Martin with the Opportunity Center for the Homelessness, an NGO in El Paso, said that his organization works with illegal aliens to, quote, facilitate travel to destinations of their choice, end quote.  These actions appear to many on the committee to constitute a violation of Section 274 of the Immigration and Nationalization Act, which prohibits any individual from encouraging or inducing someone to enter the country unlawfully or helping transport them to the interior. Corruption and waste were rampant in the spending by the NGOs.  Under the Biden-Harris administration, DHS's top watchdog audited millions of dollars that had gone to local grant recipients over a six-month period in 2021. They found that a lack of documentation kept them from determining how more than half the money had been spent. In some cases, they discovered that funds had been used to pay for benefits for individuals who were legally inadmissible to receive them. The Biden  border crisis provided to be a profitable business for some NGOs. According to the Free Press, three large NGOs involved in handling unaccompanied alien children, the Global Refuge, who received 85% of its revenue from governmental grants, Endeavors, who received 97% of their revenue from governmental grants,  and Southwest Keys program, who received an astonishing 99% of its revenue from the federal government. These three groups saw their combined revenue grow to an astonishing $2 billion plus by 2022. I would argue that these groups had a vested interest in prolonging the crisis when NGO Southwest Key Properties  use the increase in government funding to raise salaries of officers and officials across the board, including, according to recent media reporting, an increase of over $675,000 increase to their CEO. Many NGOs tried to mislead the public in how these funds were being allocated. This was documented by a recent Florida grand jury investigation.  That just said that in that investigation, the grand jury said that they were actively obstructed. They were obstructed from determining how these federal dollars were spent. The grand jury also noted that some NGOs received the vast majority of their federal funding from grants, or the vast majority of their funding from federal grants. Pretty interesting for groups that like to call themselves non-governmental organizations.  The American people are tired of being told that we should fund the actions of lawbreakers. They are tired of groups encouraging people to cross the border illegally and organizations that facilitate the release of illegal aliens into the interior. When would-be border crossers know that they will receive a host of benefits that await them immediately after crossing the border, they are more likely to make the deadly and dangerous journey.  That's exactly what happened on the Biden-Harris watch as millions of vulnerable people put themselves in harm's way at the hands of cartels and smuggling groups. An untold number perished along the route. Tens of thousands of more suffered physical and sexual abuse on the way, and many are still trapped today paying off their cartel debt through forced labor or working in the sex trade. We can and should look for ways to care for the vulnerable  and less fortunate, but using taxpayer dollars to undermine our laws and the well-being of Americans and migrants alike is not the way to do it. We cannot let taxpayer dollars be used to facilitate law-breaking, and we must shine a light on this disgraceful step as we begin to hold these organizations accountable.

Mr. Chairman, my Republican colleagues and the Trump administration are waging a war on faith and civil society in the United States. That is a real inside job. So let's talk about it.  Faith-based service and civic associations bring Americans together in pursuit of the greater good, and that threatens Donald Trump and mega-Republicans because they believe their political strength lies in driving wedges between people.  In their pursuit of political power, Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans are ripping apart the fabric of what makes America great, our freedom to believe, to practice our faith, and to associate in civic organizations that help us in our pursuit of happiness.  Donald Trump started his second term by attacking religious organizations, and he's not rested since. On the first day in office, Donald Trump paused foreign assistance for the needy, harming the work of faith-based religious agencies. On his second day in office, Donald Trump decided that deportation forces could begin entering houses of worship to arrest migrants.  After a week in office, Donald Trump OMB attempted to freeze federal grants, including the nonprofit security grant program, which helped houses of worship protect themselves from violence.

I would now like to take a moment to formally introduce our witnesses. First, I'd like to introduce Mike Howe. Mike is the president of the Oversight Project, which has done significant work through litigation and investigation to uncover information about the Biden border crisis.  He served as oversight counsel at the Department of Homeland Security under the first Trump administration and has senior experience in different oversight positions on Capitol Hill. A graduate of Duke University and Emory Law School, Howe is also a board member of the National Immigration Center for Enforcement. Second, I'd like to introduce Allie Hopper. She is a nationally recognized expert in human trafficking and the president  and founder of Guard Against Trafficking, an organization that conducts research and advocacy to counter exploitation and human trafficking. She authors Florida's landmark anti-grooming bill, now used as a model language in states across the country. She has testified before Congress on child trafficking and has delivered numerous congressional briefings on human trafficking.  She conducts on-the-ground research in the United States, Mexico, Central and South America, and has trained Interpol in South America, has trained law enforcement officers here at home, and policymakers across multiple states and countries. Last is Julio Rosas. He is an expert and a renowned national correspondent for Blaze Media.  As a journalist, he has reported on the ground from the southwest border during the Biden border crisis and has uncovered many riots and protests and has covered many riots and protests across the country, notably those sparked by Antifa and the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020. Giulio has previously served in the United States Marine Corps as a reserve.  I want to thank all of our witnesses for being here.

The violent obstruction and subversion of the United States that is emanating from so-called non-governmental organizations, unwell individuals, some probably paid, and supported by the political mainstreaming of violent rhetoric from national politicians should not come as a surprise. We saw the writing on the wall during the Biden border crisis.  with the sick marriage between the government and so-called non-governmental organizations facilitating illegal immigration. The reason I call these groups so-called non-governmental organizations is because they, for the most part, draw funds from the government or have a preferential tax status from the government. They are more creatures of the government than they are non-governmental.  Now the United States of America is still reeling from the consequences of the worst border invasion in history. This was an invasion that was planned, promoted, encouraged, funded, and sustained by radical elements of the previous administration. This invasion could not have been accomplished without a colossal partnership between the government and open borders organizations.  Simply put, under the Biden administration's open border policies, the government could only do so much to facilitate mass illegal immigration, welcome illegal aliens into the United States, and move them around the country. The Biden administration needed help, so they drove an estimated $6 billion to a conglomerate of 15 UN agencies and over 200 nonprofits, as recently calculated by the Center for Immigration Studies, to do the open borders work for them.  Now, my organization, the Oversight Project, has led the way on exposing this border industrial complex. In December of 22, we published the first-of-its-kind study tracking the cell phone movement of illegal aliens through these organizations at the border. With only a small sample size of 30,000 devices, we found that these devices went to 431 congressional districts. That's nearly everywhere in the country.  In New York, we discovered a taxpayer-funded shelter providing false residency documents to illegals. In Mexico, we discovered flyers at an illegal alien staging camp encouraging illegals to remember to vote for Biden when they got in the U.S. In Arizona, we found a Mexican consulate official at an NGO advising illegals on how to lie to law enforcement and evade ICE.  We have produced documentary evidence of non-citizens admitting on camera to being registered to vote in Arizona, Georgia, Minnesota, and North Carolina. This year, we obtained video evidence of an open borders organization in New York City hosting a seminar on how to evade ICE.  This is the new trend. Open borders organizations are now in the obstruction of ICE business. Without the partnership and the money of the Biden administration, a blob of nonprofits, legal groups, and foot soldiers are taking to the streets to create chaos. This makes sense because the goal has always been destabilization. This destabilization is happening right here around us.  Incendiary and defamatory protest rhetoric linked to the Group 50-51 and FLARE, which is formerly the May Day Movement, which did no kings, which many members of this body promoted, and Party for Socialism and Liberation movements are some of the groups that are radicalizing individuals and inciting violence. And this only ends in violence.  Now, the Oversight Project has asked this administration, the President Trump's administration, to stop issuing permits for peaceful protest to non-peaceful groups. People should be able to go to work in D.C. without being spat on, assaulted, or having an air horn blown into their eardrums. This happens all the time. I know firsthand.  In conclusion, I'd encourage you all to think broadly about the blob of various organizations and strategies that were involved in sustaining the Biden border crisis and also understand what is still happening today. I thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Mr. Howell. At this time, I'd like to recognize Ms. Hopper for her five minutes to summarize her opening statement."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 29, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 2083.57, "text": " Chairman Guest, Ranking Member Thompson, and distinguished committee members, thank you for the opportunity to testify. My name is Allie Hopper, president and co-founder of Guard Against Trafficking, a nonprofit dedicated to combating human trafficking. As a Hispanic mother, I have held a six-year-old Colombian child in my arms, cold, dirty, and shaking, left to die at the border by the cartel.  I have seen children that have crossed the border alone, holding scraps of paper with sponsor information given to them by the cartels. When I testified in November, we discussed the exploitation of children at our border. Today, countless children continue to be neglected, abused, or trafficked by a system meant to protect them. We must ask, how was this allowed to happen, and what role did NGOs play?  My research partner, Dr. Jared Sadowski, and I have conducted extensive field work, including interviewing incarcerated traffickers, cartel members, whistleblowers, and unaccompanied alien children themselves. An ORR field specialist had visited a home to place a 17-year-old and reported serious concerns, most notably that the adult claiming to be the child's mother was adorned in MS-13 tattoos.  Despite these concerns, ORR leadership overruled that specialist. Tragically, three months later, that child was found dead, his pants around his ankles, with an older man passed out next to him. This heartbreaking case is not isolated. It highlights a system overwhelmed by both scale and mismanagement.  Since 2008, over $20 billion has been dispersed under the UAC program, almost $14 billion of that in the last six years alone, meaning over two-thirds of funding was spent in just one-third of the program's lifespan. Yet despite this massive investment, hundreds of thousands of children remain unaccounted for as the U.S. taxpayer dollars fueled a system hijacked by criminal networks.  No-bid, billion-dollar contracts were awarded with little oversight, while influx facilities became transportation hubs.  A striking example is Endeavors. Their IRS filing show revenue soaring from $65 million in 2019 to $1.18 billion in 2022, driven almost entirely by federal contracts. During this time, CEO John Allman's salary rose from $292,000 to $730,000, with six-figure executive surge bonuses added.  Endeavors ended 2022 with $112 million surplus. Andrew Lorenzen Strait, a former Biden transition official and ICE advisor, helped secure no-bid federal contracts for Endeavors and was caught on camera calling the border crisis a boom for business. Inside Endeavors, leadership blocked critical safety protocols, resisted oversight, and silenced internal dissent.  Our interviews with contracted auditors at Endeavor's Pico, Texas facility revealed disturbing findings.  Male staff had been found inside female dorm rooms. An employee had led 150 teenage girls in sexually explicit routines, dance routines, teaching them how to twerk on multiple occasions. A female over 18 had been shielded from ice. Others nearing 18 were released early to avoid transfer to ice. And auditors were blocked from reviewing child sponsor placements.  These abuses are not unique to Endeavors. Similar patterns existed across multiple NGOs. Federal contracts had prioritized speed over safety and rewarded output over outcomes, conditions which cartels exploited.  A cartel operative in Tecate, Mexico explained to us how children were routinely kidnapped and funneled into the US for profit. Cartels infiltrated NGOs along those smuggling routes, turning humanitarian pathways into trafficking pipelines. Weak sponsor vetting worsened this problem. An HHS audit later found that 70% of sponsor applications were fraudulent  making proper post-placement welfare checks nearly impossible. Recently, we discovered about 117 unaccompanied children believed to be trafficked on a farm in the Midwest, where our intervention sparked a current investigation. These cases are emerging nationwide. Last week, ICE and CBP arrested about 361 illegal aliens at two cannabis farms in California, finding 10 unaccompanied children. So where do we go from here?  This is not about politics, it's about protecting children and confronting modern-day slavery. Good intentions and humanitarian missions must never excuse harm when policies enable exploitation, accountability, and decisive action must ensure it never happens again."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 30, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2417.818, "text": "Thank you, Ms. Hopper. I now recognize Mr. Rosas for five minutes to summarize his opening statement.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today about this important topic. I've been covering the U.S.-Mexico border as a reporter since 2019. I saw firsthand how secured the southern border was during President Trump's first term. I went on to be at the southern border for the next four years to document the deliberate and horrific open border policies implemented by the Biden-Harris administration. The numbers don't lie. The videos don't lie. What our country experienced was a deliberate invasion at the behest of the previous administration.  Their efforts could not have been possible without the non-governmental organizations who provided the federal government the ability to flood our country with people who brazenly cross our borders illegally. The NGOs located along the border were often the first place processed migrants went to after being released by Border Patrol. These organizations helped the Biden-Harris administration avoid the bad optics of released migrants having to be on the street due to the large volume of overcrowding in certain sectors.  Even with those efforts, the mass overcrowding still resulted in people sleeping on the streets, sometimes during the winter. Ultimately, the goal of these NGOs was to get people to their desired destination within the United States and get them settled in, even though their legal status was far from being secured. I would often see volunteers or staffers at the airport when I left the border, guiding these process migrants to ensure they made their flights. A few times, I saw them ushering unaccompanied minors.  This is haunting to think back on now, knowing that Biden's HHS lost track of tens of thousands of minors once they reached their supposed final destination. By having this guaranteed help once they reached U.S. soil, illegal aliens had greater incentive to put their lives in danger by traversing through the Darien Gap and cartel-controlled territory in Mexico."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 31, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 2531.288, "text": "One shelter in El Paso told me in 2023 around 80% of the women who had come to them had been raped, sometimes in front of their children."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 32, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2540.208, "text": " This highlights that despite the NGOs having the stated goal of helping these people, their help ends up harming the people who would go to use their services.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the panelists for being here today. Let me ask you all a yes or no question, and we're going to build this thing out. Do you believe if an employee or an agent of an NGO  that is implicated in child trafficking in a criminal investigation, if they cross the threshold of reasonable suspicion and they're investigated, then that investigation leads to the jurisdictional authority, the investigative authority, developing probable cause. So they cross the threshold of probable cause and they're arrested.  And then they're prosecuted. And if they're convicted, they cross the threshold of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And they are convicted.

Mr. Howell, are you aware that ongoing right now, right now in our country,  if DHS, ICE, FBI, local and state law enforcement agencies working on classified operations to locate, find, and rescue trafficked tender age, mostly girls, talking about girls under 14 and younger, across the country that were trafficked into our country in 2021, 22, 23, and 24. Are you aware that those operations are ongoing? Yes, sir. They're trying to find the children the Biden administration lost.  Thank you, Mr. Howell. Ms. Hopper, are you aware? I am. Mr. Rosas? Correct. I'm aware. Thank you. Would you be surprised? According to my research, which will very soon be revealed next week, they've rescued so far 35,000 tender age kids. How do you like that?  Now, according to Ms. Hopper's research, which I find fascinating, everybody up here should, 70% of the documentation turned in by so-called sponsors, which were lined up by who? NGOs. Through who? Primarily HHS. It was a pipeline, man. We fed a pipeline.  of tender age children into sex trafficking and slave labor into our country. We're finding these kids. We're tracking this fraudulent documents. You're right, Ms. Hopper. My research showed a little bit less, 65%. You said 70%. I'll go with 70. So be advised. Be advised.  We are building out case files, criminal case files. We're interviewing these 35,000 kids, and we're finding out exactly what the hell happened, how they ended up in the nightmare where they were, and we're rescuing more. And there's nothing anybody can do about it. We're gonna identify these children, we're locating these children, we're rescuing these children, and we're building out criminal files based upon the testimony of these young teenagers and the documentation of fraudulent  vetting, and many of these NGO employees are going to find themselves wearing orange, be that new favorite color.

We're all present to cast their votes? Mr. Clerk, we're all present and cast our votes to your knowledge? Yes, all were present in the room when they voted.  The Ranking Member has yielded back. At this time, I would recognize myself for my five minutes of questioning. I want to respond to some of the allegations contained in the Ranking Member's opening statement. And Mr. Thompson, I'm assuming you didn't write that statement because you have known me for some period of time.  I know you to be someone that I have a longstanding relationship with and do not believe that you would write an opening statement attacking mine or the Christianity of any other member of this committee. I don't believe that you would weaponize my religious beliefs. I don't believe that you would criticize me because I choose to teach Sunday school in my church and to somehow say that because I'm a Sunday school, because I'm a Christian,  that me being a part of this hearing in some way flies in the face of my religious beliefs. Because what we're doing here today is we are not casting a broad net on every non-governmental organization, every non-profit. We are instead focusing this hearing on those who have profited off of the illegal immigration that we saw under the Biden-Harris administration.  I have mentioned nothing in my statement about non-profits such as Red Cross, Catholic Charities, Samaritan's Purse, Doctors Without Borders, non-profits who actually take money and use it for the good, who are out there collecting money from their congregation, from members of the community who wish to give back.  Instead, this hearing is focused on those handful of nonprofits who received their money almost exclusively from grants from the federal government, but yet still claim to be nonprofits. Ms. Hopper, you mentioned two of those in your written testimony, two that I referenced in my opening statement, those two being Endeavors,  who, according to my information that I received, Endeavors received 97% of their funding  from federal or local grants. They weren't out raising money. They weren't out there ringing the bell there at Christmas asking people to give money. They weren't in churches asking members of the congregation to please give to these organizations. They were instead an arm of the federal government in that they received 97% of their funding. And then Southwest Key Properties was an NGO  that blew past that. 99% of their funding came from grants from the federal government. And what did these organizations do with that? You talk about in your testimony, Ms. Hopper, you talk about Endeavor, that in 2020, Endeavor reported $52 million in revenue, that in 2021,  they reported $658 million in revenue, a $600 million increase in a year with 97% of that money coming from the federal government. And then in 2022, they reported a record $1.18 billion from the federal government, or at least 97% of that.  You talk about how executives for Endeavor padded their pockets, that with this increase in revenue comes increase in salary, that the compensation for the CEO doubled. You talk about these particular CEOs that I mentioned, instead of using that money to protect children, they were treating this money like venture capitalists. You also stated in there that an Endeavor's  individual, someone within their organization said that the border crisis was a boom for business. In an article from the New York Post, they talk about another one of these nonprofits. They talk about Southwest Key.  The headline says Texas nonprofit housing migrant kids took $3 billion in grants from Biden administration and boosted executive salaries up to 139% to pull the plug. And so I am offended when people from the other side say that we're not being Christian, that we don't want to help people.  We're not saying that all nonprofits are bad. Many of us support and give money and volunteer to those. But this hearing today is focused on those nonprofits which were government funded, which were used by the Biden-Harris administration to continue to move people across the border against the will of the public.  and without the authorization of Congress. So with that, I yield back, and I now recognize my friend from California, Mr. Carrere, for five minutes for his questioning of the witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I do hope to continue to work with you as a friend here in this committee. I would also, though, want to point out that some of our witnesses have to be careful with their testimony. Mr. Rosa has pointed out  Catholic Charities as being one of those organizations that receive funding. I'm a Catholic. I'm kind of disappointed in that. Why? Because of what the chairman said. This Catholic Charities does good work. And you pointed out somebody who got money to do something that was unethical or illegal. Thank you. But Mr. Chairman,  Big job here of this committee is oversight. Homeland Security's budget is doubled. The mission, as was pointed out, some of the witnesses here today, was to go after undocumented criminals. Yet, back home every day, we're a peaceful, loving community. Masked ICE agents, no badge,  no identification, grabbing people off the streets on the suspicion that they may be undocumented. Today, 70% of those apprehended, undocumented, are not criminals. They're hardworking taxpayers. Recently, a pastor in Florida that had been here for 20 years with a stay of removal was arrested.  All of you have known, I told you the story, I'll tell it again. Father, 25 years, not a traffic ticket to his name. Father of three Marines was apprehended. DHS recently raided a church in California, sanctuary. I thought we're supposed to go after criminals.  What authority does DHS have to go after churches? Are these the right people? Not quite sure. Are we creating a national federal police here with unlimited powers? But you know, let's not talk about undocumented here. Let's talk about US citizens, okay? Countless US citizens being detained in this country  In my district, an attorney, woman, female, walking down Centennial Park, apprehended by ICE, did not touch, did not do anything offensive to the ICE agent, was arrested, put in a van with no windows, cuffed, taken to a detention center for hours. What are we coming to?  Many stories like that, U.S. citizens being detained by ICE, not for a few hours, but for a few days. So a U.S. citizen speaking with an accent. U.S. citizens. Do I have to carry around a passport now? Do I have to tell children that are American citizens to have their ID and passports with them? Is that what we're coming to?  Mr. Chairman, I wanna work with you. Let's work on oversight, okay? A lot of these ICE agents, their performance, are probably gonna rely on that defense called qualified immunity when they do things like violate our constitutional rights. What's our defense for not doing a job of oversight? Facial recognition technology now?  Everybody now, citizens or not, U.S. citizens, facial recognition technology without your permission, without a warrant. We should, Mr. Chairman, today have Todd Lyons, Acting Director of ICE, come before this committee and explain what's going on.  Mr. Chairman, pursuant to clause two, sub K, sub six of rule 11, I move that the committee subpoena Mr. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I move the table. There is a motion to table. Mr. Crater, do you yield back at this point? Yes. And the gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Florida has moved to table.  The motion is privileged and is non-debatable. All those in favor of the motion to table, please signify by stating aye. Aye. Any opposed, signify by stating no. No. In the opinion of the chairs, the ayes have it. Is there a request, Mr. Ranking Member? Recorded vote, sir. A request for Mr. Correa for a recorded vote.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Hopper, how many children do you think that DHS basically lost and didn't have track of during the four years of the Biden administration that were admitted to the United States?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 71, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 4927.818, "text": " The reports vary, but as of the last number that we were made aware of was over 325,000 children that went unaccounted for."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 72, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 4936.39, "text": "325,000 children are not accounted for. So, my colleagues on the other side don't want to speak about this hearing. They want nothing to do with this hearing. Why? Because of the failure, and one of the greatest failures in American history,  of the Biden administration, I believe, was in not keeping track of children. And it wasn't like the folks that sit on the other side of this aisle weren't made aware by people sitting on this side of the aisle that it was happening.  They failed to do anything or speak out against really this atrocity that was happening to the children that were coming through the border. So this hearing is about the enrichment of certain NGOs and their part in this tragedy.  But also one thing that we haven't talked about is really, not only did this administration enrich a lot of these NGOs, and I'm not painting them all the same, I'm Catholic, all right? And I'm a really good friend of Mark, Archbishop in Miami, all right? We have dinner and all that, so I know the great work that they do, but I know there's also bad apples in there. But also, the billions of dollars  that flowed to the Mexican cartels through human traffic. And all of it, all of it, and you heard, this is not the first time you're gonna hear me say it, was done on purpose. Because you can't be that stupid. You can't be that dumb. And so the Biden administration allowed, lost track of 300,000 people, children, all right,  probably lost track of millions of other people, migrants, in the United States as they were being trafficked all around, some indentured servants, the children indentured servants and even worse, in sex trade, all done on purpose. That has to be one of the biggest scandals in American history. And that's why  My colleagues on the other side are running for the hills. You can run, but you can't hide, and you can't justify the inexcusable. It's not like we didn't tell them. It wasn't like I wasn't here for four years telling them, hey, this is happening, and it's done on purpose. A lot of my colleagues here were doing the same thing, and they just ran away. Now they're trying to say, well, I don't want to talk about this. I don't want to talk about what we're talking about today.  What we're trying to bring to light is we want to make sure this never happens again. And yeah, we need to bring it to light right now because it wasn't going to be brought to light under the Biden administration. And make sure that it never happens again. And I thank God that we have President Trump in office who has controlled the border and so  The cartels aren't getting richer by the minute using human trafficking, and that our children, those children are not being exploited.

Today I speak as a representative of the American people who desire accountability, transparency, and integrity.  My Republican colleagues on this committee continue to discuss fabricated allegations and are intimidating NGOs, a step straight out of the authoritarian playbook. If they want to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse, this committee should instead focus on DHS Inspector General Joseph Koufari's failure to uphold his office's core principles of accountability, transparency, and integrity.  The position of Inspector General is a vital one. IGs are tasked with ensuring  the agency they oversee remains honest and lawful. During a period when the DHS is riddled with incompetence and abuse of law, the Inspector General is ever so important. However, it is clear that Mr. Kufari is incapable of holding DHS responsible due to his own disregard for accountability.  IG Kafari misused $1.4 million in taxpayer dollars by hiring a private law firm to investigate his own employees in retaliation for their criticism of his qualifications. He ultimately had to pay one of those employees $1.7 million settlement. Inspector Generals are supposed to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, not be the source of retaliation.  The IG misrepresented himself during his confirmation process by failing to disclose when asked that at the time of his retirement from the Justice Department, he was under investigation by the DOJ's Office of Inspector General for ethics violations.  Furthermore, he provided inaccurate and misleading answers with respect to possible misconduct when he was a federal law enforcement officer. We also know that Mr. Khafari routinely deleted text messages from his own government-issued phone, a violation of federal record-keeping laws.  Lastly, he continuously obstructed this committee's work by refusing to respond to inquiries and blocking his employees from appearing for transcribed interviews.  Investigating all of these controversies, the Council of Inspector General on Integrity and Efficiency, an office then run by a Trump-appointed inspector general, found that Mr. Khafari had abused his authority and engaged in substantial misconduct, recommending that President Biden fire him.  Mr. Khafari's tenure as Inspector General has been marked by fraud, waste, and abuse. He has rendered the very watchdog office meant to protect DHS from abuse and mismanagement untrustworthy and inefficient.

At this time, the chair would recognize for five minutes of his questioning Mr. Pfluger from the great state of Texas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've never been so disappointed to sit in a partisan hearing. I mean, what a joke. And let me just correct the record for  The gentleman from Mississippi talking about the floods in Texas and FEMA not being there, false. Completely false. They were there. I don't think the ranking member was there. I was there. Several people on this committee were there.  So the assertion that FEMA was not there, you wanna politicize something, go politicize something else. But that's out of bounds. What a tragedy, and to try to take advantage of that in this space, the Homeland Security space, formed after 9-11, what a tragic statement to make. I mean,  Of all the things, and we kind of knew the politicization was coming, but for it to happen in this committee? Secretary was there multiple times. FEMA director was engaged everywhere. People on this committee were recovering and searching for bodies. I'm just, I'm shocked. Totally shocked at that statement. You know where else?  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle were not. They weren't at the border for the last four years. I was there. I'd like to seek unanimous consent to submit for the record two videos from the Darien Gap from a CODEL in 2023, Mr. Chairman. Without objection. These videos show the children that are walking through and  Only one Democrat accepted the offer to go to that CODEL, to go see firsthand, only one. The entire subcommittee was invited, and yet only one, and he's no longer a member, only one. And you know how many hearings we had at the border from 2021 and 2022? Zero. You know how many hearings we had on border security from 2021 to 2022? Zero. So it's pretty rich to hear the assertions from the gentleman from Mississippi  that the FEMA director's not involved in flooding, that DHS is not involved in flooding. Ms. Hopper, in your testimony, you talk about unprecedented trafficking due to lax sponsor vetting, and you also talk about alarming conditions and falsified records. I'm gonna give you two minutes to describe  the lack of sponsored vetting that led to the abuse of children at a level that is completely unprecedented.

So, it's pretty rich to say that we shouldn't be looking at NGOs that had a role, that were culpable and complicit in not vetting people or not doing the appropriate work.  Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding this hearing. I yield back. The gentleman yields back. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Swalwell. Nobody asked for the cruel deportations that we're seeing right now. We were promised that violent criminals, the worst in our community, would be removed. I'm good with that.  I don't want violent criminals who are undocumented in our community. I'll help with that. Put out a list of 1,000 people. Most Americans are up for getting those folks out of our community. We were promised the worst would be removed. What we have found is that rather than focusing on the worst offenders in our community,  This administration arrested a six-year-old battling leukemia and detained that six-year-old in the cruelest, harshest conditions. ICE detained six-year-old leukemia patient and his family, even though they followed every immigration rule. In detention, the children cried every night, according to the family's attorney.  The woman's six-year-old son also experienced bruising and bone pain, both symptoms of leukemia and missed an appointment related to his cancer treatment. His sister barely ate. Don't give me this Christian nonsense that I've heard from some of these witnesses. I'm a Christian. I'm a father. I'm from a law enforcement family. I was a prosecutor. This is not who we are. This is not what any American signed up for.  This administration deported a four-year-old American citizen battling cancer. They arrested a U.S. marshal. They're not up for this job. They're just up for the cruelty, for owning the libs. They're not serious about protecting our communities from the worst.  and these ice agents running around our communities like masked bank robbers terrorizing women. They're gonna get themselves hurt, and I hope that doesn't happen. And we're already seeing women are being targeted by people who are impersonating ice agents.  I hope every state that is able to, and every community that is able to, unmasks ICE with their policies. If you're standing on the law, you can show your face. The FBI, they're probably doing a search and seizure right now at some dangerous criminal's home. They're not masked. They loudly, on their blue jackets,  have that yellow insignia that says FBI. No other law enforcement agency in America runs around our communities masked. It's time that we unmask ICE. This is an administration that does not want to be held accountable.  Secretary Noem does not want to come in and testify. Stephen Miller certainly doesn't want to sit in that chair and defend putting this six-year-old battling leukemia into deportation proceedings. Tom Homan doesn't want to come here and defend why he thinks it's okay to target people based on their accent and the color of their skin. Yes, he said that. Thankfully, a California court  has shut that down, and hopefully more lawsuits are brought across America to shut that down. But my Republican colleagues in Congress, they don't work for the administration. They are, theoretically, an independent branch of government. Article One, the preeminent branch of government. So why do they go for this? Why do they enable this? Why aren't they outraged that this six-year-old boy was  in a condition where Children are crying every night and experiencing bone pain as he fights cancer. This issue is pretty simple. Go after the worst and protect the most vulnerable, the ones who are contributing to our community. So if our Republican colleagues are not up for holding the administration accountable, then Democrats will.  So, Mr. Chairman, pursuant to Clause 2K6 of Rule 11, I move that the committee subpoena White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller. Does the gentleman yield back? Yes. Is there a motion? Motion to table. There has been a motion to table. Recorded vote. The gentleman moves the motion to table.

We have to do a better job here on this committee as far as oversight goes. There's multiple problems that I see. We should do our absolute best in the department to not make mistakes. The number of 325,000 missing children is a problem. We shouldn't have that problem.

They absolutely should be held accountable. I know they should be, but are you saying that they are or are not? Are not.

We can bitch about it all day long, which we're just going to beat each other up and we're not going to go anywhere. I'm really trying to fix this problem, okay? So, we have to move legislatively in order to solve that problem. Right, and H.R. 2 contains a provision which would do a lot of that. It could also be improved.  Okay, so my next step as a congressional member is to write out legislation that both sides would agree on in order to fix this problem. That sounds like a pretty good fix, correct? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Here we are again, La La Land and Homeland Security Committee conducting oversight of the president and his administration. Great, because there are many, many things that Congress should be conducting oversight over this administration.  Donald Trump campaigned on finding convicted criminals who are unlawfully here in this country and deporting them. The worst of the worst, he said. Instead, he and his unidentified masked secret ICE agents are snatching and arresting immigrants from court proceedings, nonviolent.  non-criminal immigrants pursuing legal pathways to immigrate to this country and then illegally detaining them in horrific conditions and even possibly deporting them despite the fact that they are here legally.  You would think the committee with jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security would want to conduct oversight over the department's refusal to allow members of Congress to observe the conditions of DHS detention facilities. In fact, there is a specific statute that authorizes both Republicans and Democrats  to conduct oversight over facilities that house or detain immigrants. But no, the department refuses. So we're here in the Homeland Security Committee, and I'm sure the Republican majority does not like it when this administration undermines its own authority, its own statutory authority, to conduct oversight. But no, instead of all of that, we are here talking yet again about Joe Biden.  Newsflash, Joe Biden is not the president. He hasn't been the president for seven months. So if we are gonna conduct oversight here, why are we doing it about the Biden administration when this administration is literally detaining lawful permanent residents and even some US citizens?  And it gets worse. It's not just those masked ICE agents. There are many FBI agents who are being called away from their duties to investigate terrorism, violent gangs, child trafficking, and other crimes in order to help ICE arrest and detain immigrants with legal asylum claims, nonviolent. That makes our homeland less safe, not more safe.  So we should hear from FBI Director Kash Vettel about how many of his criminal investigators are being taken away from their criminal investigatory jobs keeping Americans safe in order to help round up non-criminal immigrants trying to immigrate the right way.  Some of these detainees are being held in Bureau of Prisons detention centers that are unfit for convicted criminals to stay in. We should hear from Pam Bondi about how much of the department's resources are being used to detain these non-violent, non-criminal immigration detainees. And while they're here, we can ask them about a very pressing question.  What's going on with the Epstein files? Donald Trump promised to release them. Pam Bondi said she had the files on her desk and that she was going to release them in the name of transparency. Kash Patel has spent years railing against the FBI to release the files.  Many of my Republican colleagues were banging on the table to release the Epstein files. But now, all of a sudden, after a months-long review, Bondi and Patel say, nothing to see here. No evidence that any American would want to see about accomplices, co-conspirators, or other peoples involved. Yesterday, the Republicans voted against releasing the files.  So what's changed? Well, we all know Donald Trump has had a relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. He flew on his plane, he hung out at parties, spoke highly of him. And now there are many people saying that Donald Trump is included in the Epstein files. In fact, there are reporters who say that there are videos of him with topless women. Elon Musk even confirmed that Trump is blocking the release of these files because he's in them.  Pam Bondi says there's nothing there, but Donald Trump even acknowledges that there is evidence there. It's just not credible. It's made up. This is a true social post from 943 this morning.  is an admission that Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. And the American people deserve to know whether he is or not.

I was in the minority back here in 2021 and some of my colleagues did and the ranking member who was chairman at that time repeatedly held votes open when they were not for members to return here to vote.

But let's put our law enforcement officers in harm's way.

It's been a long time in this committee. But I want to start by talking about civil society. Because civil society, in my opinion, is the first line of defense for our communities when authoritarianism, like the one that the president is attempting on our democracy, tries to attack us.  And when Trump demands a public enemy and abuses our authority to target them, it is civil society that holds the line. I find it deeply undemocratic and un-American and unacceptable that my Republican colleagues are targeting more than 212 organizations across the country that assist community members, including immigrant children, since we've been talking about children as if you care about immigrant children, and asylum seekers to meet their basic needs.  So I want to make sure that I remind my colleagues, since we've been here for a while, that Secretary Noman said administration a couple of things. First of all, crossing a border to the U.S. to request the opportunity to apply for asylum is actually legal. Adjusting your status, if you have a pathway to do so, is legal.  Supporting immigrants to apply for asylum, TPS, parole, and other forms of relief is legal. Supporting people to become United States citizens is also legal. Look, Republicans are going to lie and gaslight us all to help their fascist boss suppress dissent. Let me ask you, who drags the reputations of essential nonprofits in our communities?  I'll tell you who, authoritarians, bullies, these weak wannabe kings who are scared of civil society because they uphold the democracy.  This hearing has been unserious, especially since the illegal and unlawful activities are actually being perpetrated by the people in the White House, the Cabinet, and Republican leadership. Tom Homan said during an interview that ICE officers and Border Patrol agents don't need any probable cause to walk up to someone, question them, and detain them based on their physical appearance, occupation, or location.  So he basically said that if someone looks like me, and a couple of colleagues here, they can walk up and question us. That is racial profiling, which is illegal. At the same time, Holman consistently complains about the communities, like the one I represent from Chicago, for knowing their rights, because if they know their rights, it's harder for him to violate them.  Tom Holman's disregard for our rights is unconstitutional. And since Mr. Holman, a.k.a. the Border Czar, has the audacity to repeatedly brag about his legal immigration enforcement practices and disrespect due process, I demand he come before us to respond to the multitude of questions we have for him in person. But not just him.  Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida is complicit in the construction of the alligator Alcatraz and the violations of human rights being perpetrated there. Florida's replica of one of our most notorious prisons is a clear illustration of the brutality of the Trump administration. They unlawfully robbed funds from cities supporting asylum seekers to build a sea-cut-like detention center in one of the most dangerous places in the United States.  Yet, DeSantis has the audacity to repeatedly brag about the inhumane conditions that allegated Alcatraz and celebrate the violence being perpetrated with American tax dollars. Governor DeSantis must testify before this committee and provide answers to our questions about the atrocities being committed in his state. And he should also bring Secretary Marco Rubio.  Because the truth is we shouldn't be sending people to foreign countries when they may face torture and death with no chance for due process or appeal, particularly when they have not had their day in court and have not been subject to an extradition request. It is a gross violation of our shared humanity and our ideals as a nation to use money that's been appropriated to support refugees to disappear them to offshore prisons in countries they do not know and have no connection to.  Yet Trump, Noem, and Rubio have repeatedly been caught red-handed, blatantly breaking the law, entering into backdoor agreements with foreign countries to deport people without due process.

The American people deserve details, accountability, and especially when it comes to their taxpayer dollars.  they deserve answers. You think about it, in recent years far too much federal funding has gone to NGOs with little oversight, questionable practices, and in some cases connections that raise serious red flags. In 2021, ICE awarded an $86 million no-bid contract to Endeavors for hotel stays for illegal immigrants. Mr. Howell  Could you broadly talk about the risk to border security and accountability when the federal government outsources key functions to non-government organizations? Absolutely. So there's a clear break in the paper trail on accountability. Once the money leaves DHS, there's little in the way of reporting requirements as to how it's spent, how it's maintained, where the illegals go, and all sorts of other  standards that relate to condition. For example, in these nonprofit facilities, not much in the way of licensing requirements or living standards are there. Yet you have all this attention on ICE facilities for quite the opposite reasons. And so it's a vastly different ecosystem.  In his testimony, Mr. Rosen noted that certain non-government organizations were present during the recent unrest in Los Angeles and many have played a role in obstructing federal operations. Mr. Howell, has your team identified any instances where federally funded non-government organizations appear to be aligned with political advocacy groups or campaigns in ways that could raise concerns about conflicts of interest or inappropriate influence?  Absolutely. I think the most recent, you know, former Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, who was impeached coming from Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, is an example of how this whole system works and the very cozy relationship between the nonprofits and governmental actors. As it relates to the violence we see in the streets, the foot soldiers and organizers, I would say, are one degree removed away  from those receiving government funds, you know, the giant organizations like Catholic Charities and others who do a lot more in terms of public advocacy. It's a very complex ecosystem all pushing in the same direction.

Thank you. To close out my time, one issue that has been raised by state and local law enforcement is the lack of communication by NGOs as they facilitate the movement and settlement of these aliens in local communities. Keeping law enforcement out of the loop creates public safety concerns.  and likewise does a disservice to the settlement of migrants. For any of our witnesses, can you speak to why these NGOs were encouraged not to work with local law enforcement and some of the downstream implications of these poor policies? It's because that would have gotten in the way of moving as many illegal aliens around the country as humanly possible, which was completely the opposite of the goal of the Biden administration and the NGOs. That's why they don't cooperate."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 159, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 17355.901, "text": " They didn't cooperate because they didn't have to cooperate contractually.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back. The gentleman yields back. The chair recognizes Mr. Magazina for five minutes of questioning. Thank you, Chairman. Donald Trump said he would focus on deporting criminals and people with removal orders, but that is not what his administration has been doing.  Instead, the Trump administration has been going after innocent, hardworking people who have committed no crimes, including children, including U.S. citizens.  Children, grandparents, veterans, students who express unpopular political opinions, and yes, even United States citizens. The latest data from Donald Trump's Department of Homeland Security, their own data, shows that more than 70% of those in ICE detention have no criminal convictions.  They are locking people up who have tried immigrating to the United States the legal way, who presented themselves at ports of entry and asked for asylum.  like Andrew Hernandez-Romero, a gay makeup artist from Venezuela who came to the United States seeking asylum. Listen to this. He did not enter the country illegally. He presented himself at a port of entry near San Diego, tried to do it the legal way. And what did the Trump administration do? They put him on a plane to El Salvador to a prison where he is still today. He has never been convicted of any crimes. He did not even enter the United States illegally. We have been asking the administration  Can you give us a proof of life? Can you let us know that he's still alive? And they refused to do so. They deported a mother from Louisiana along with her seven-year-old daughter and four-year-old son, both of whom are U.S. citizens, and the four-year-old has stage four cancer.  The mother of these children has said that she did not consent to having her children deported with her. Secretary Noem was here and she said under oath that she had documentation proving that the mother had consented. She said she would provide it. She still has not.  Representative Swalwell and I followed up with her. She still has not presented any documentation, any rationale for why this four-year-old U.S. citizen with cancer was deported to a country that is not his own. And so when I hear my colleagues and when I hear our witnesses saying that they care about the lives of the children,  I'm sorry, you have no credibility if you are not prepared to call out the injustice of deporting a four-year-old with cancer, a seven-year-old with leukemia. Where's your sympathy for those children? No, Donald Trump gets a free pass always, no matter what he does from this crowd. That's how we know that what we're hearing  It's political today, not a real concern for the children who have been caught up in all of this. There's more. This family in Oregon, four children, all U.S. citizens, these four children, along with their parents, who have no criminal record, were put into detention by ICE for two weeks in a Border Patrol facility that is not designed for long-term detention, a 10 by 10 cell.  that these five were in. They were just released after two weeks. These U.S. citizen children, where's the concern for them? We know why this is happening. It's because on May 21st, Stephen Miller summoned ICE officials to Washington and ordered them to make mass arrests, not to focus on criminals.  He said, go after people at Home Depot and 7-Eleven. Because again, unlike what President Trump promised, that they were gonna go after the worst of the worst, Stephen Miller, who apparently is calling the shots, ordered ICE to round up everybody, regardless of whether they are hardened criminals or not. Please, someone tell me, what threat to our country did these children pose? Or their parents who have lived here and worked here for years and committed no crimes in the country?  Is this the worst of the worst? Of course not. This is the same Stephen Miller, by the way, who was the architect of the family separation policy under the first Trump administration, during which 4,600 children were removed from their parents, some as young as 10 months old. Where's the concern for those 4,600 children? I haven't heard a word from any of our partisan witnesses or any of my partisan colleagues on the other side.  You lose your credibility when you refuse to acknowledge the humanity of those 4,600 children who were separated purposefully from their families by the first Trump administration or the children who are being unlawfully detained and deported today. I'll leave you with this. Pope Leo, His Holiness, posted on X about the Trump administration deporting people to El Salvador. He said, quote, do you not see the suffering?  Is your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet? This is not what the American people want. Let's focus on going after real criminals, not children, not U.S. citizens, not people who are just trying to make a living who pose no threat. Let's focus on the criminals. I yield back.  Chairman yields back, the Chair recognizes Mr. Buchanan for his five minutes of questioning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We tend to find tactics of distraction, distraction, distraction, distraction. It's what we see happening with people that are trying to stop ICE from deportation efforts. We see that happening in the committee and HR 2 is not law.  What H.R. 2 was designed to do is to stop the $6 billion. That's an entire state budget.  Many of us think about the size of your state budget. $6 billion under the Biden administration went to these non-government organizations, many of which are 100% federally funded, like Endeavors, that reached the size of Save the Children. Ms. Hopper, you mentioned that in your testimony. Save the Children, been around for generations. It's designed for, it's privately funded.  This Endeavor's non-government organization went from $52 million and went to over $1 billion because of government funding. Ms. Hopper, you talked about the NGOs being complicit.  I don't know how many were stirred by your conversation about the 17-year-old child that was placed with someone that was discovered from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, had tattoos resembling that of MS-13 gang members. It was reported, supervisors overruled that, a month or two later, the 17-year-old is found dead. A man passed out has pants, de-pantsed.  Sexual activity being absolutely implied. And you're talking about all the different ways that these NGOs who've got rich, $700,000 CEO figures for the CEO of Endeavors, and that man needs to be held accountable, John Allmans. We're talking about  Children that were ushered into the interior of the United States. These NGOs profited from it. Cozy relationships with the Democrat administration. Who knows what political payback there is? Who knows how many of those dollars that are still retained, when you're talking a billion dollars retained by these organizations, who knows how many of the activities that are trying to stop deportation  are still, those dollars are reproducing after themselves. Who knows how many times we will also see in New York City people being taught how to evade ICE, we know as NGOs. This is a lawmaking exercise. We hold these hearings to hold people accountable for the misuse of taxpayer funds. This is evil. And we haven't solved it and we have to have legislation to stop any future administration from co-opting FEMA dollars and repurposing for these nefarious ends.  All right, Mr. Howell, you all did a project where you took these NGOs, these 230 NGOs, some of them out of country helping bring people in, some of them in country working as an Uber service. You all did a $30,000 data search on cell phones, and you found among these 230 organizations, of which 15 United Nations organizations,  spins by the U.S. government, funneled through the U.N., ended up into some of these NGOs. You all found that, tracking 30,000 cell phones, that the Uber service, these organizations getting rich, went to every congressional district in this committee hearing, not just every congressional district in this hearing, every congressional district in the United States, moving unaccompanied minors, children, to these sponsors.  Only four congressional districts out of 435 congressional districts where these NGOs were not moving people. The gentleman who raped and murdered Lakin Riley was among the list who had two trips where he went to New York City paid for at NGO expense. I'm sorry, taxpayer expense funneled through these non-government organizations. I need to let you talk.  You're absolutely right, sir. So for our study back in 2022 in this country, in towns across it, we're seeing flights being dropped off in the middle of the night with no advance notice. Citizens were living in fear. We decided to do a small, very small sample size of that huge mass of the NGO blob. We looked at only 30 locations for a one month period, grabbed the cell phone movement in and out of them, 30,000 devices. And from that very small sample size, they went to every single congressional district,  I've got 19 seconds left, I wanna say this. You also report that in New York, you saw that these funds were being used for shelter programs, providing false residency documents to illegal, showing them how to provide false documents. Other NGO, you found in Mexico tied into this, illegal alien camps that had flyers telling people, don't forget to vote for Biden. You had NGOs advising illegals to lie to law enforcement to evade ICE. All a part of your organization's information  We need to spend more time on this because this could still continue in the future absent legislation prohibiting and cranking the screws down to make sure this is never repeated. I yield.  The gentleman from New York, Mr. Kennedy, for five minutes. Thank you, Chairman. Earlier, I entered into the record a press release from this Republican-led committee stating that the U.S. Conference of Bishops and Catholic Charities USA are under investigation directly contradicting what was stated by my Republican colleagues in this committee earlier in our deliberations.  I'd like to enter into the record a letter from Pope Francis to the bishops of the United States of America back on February 10, 2025. Pope Francis sent a letter to the U.S. Conference of Bishops rebuking the Trump administration on its mass deportation policies, which included the deportation of U.S. citizens, mind you.  Just a couple of months later, what seems like retribution from the Trump administration and congressional Republicans, now Catholic Charities USA and US Conference of Bishops are being investigated, and funding's being cut to the humanitarian work that they're doing across our country. It's deeply offensive to Catholics across this nation, and it reeks of anti-Catholicism, and it needs to stop. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.  As is the case with all of our districts, there are many organizations that do incredible work that help resettle new Americans and refugees. We lose sight of the selfless humanitarian work that these local non-government organizations do when we rope them in with the partisan grievances that we're hearing here today. In my own district,  There's hundreds of refugees that have settled in just the last three months alone. But in the last year across our country, over 100,000 refugees have come to this great nation who have faced unimaginable hardship.  based on religion, race, nationality, political opinions, or sexual orientation. And they rely on the housing, case management, nutrition, and job placement services provided by these NGOs. And they're doing their best to make ends meet, to become a part of a new committee and community. And while that is critical life-altering support made possible in large part to the federal government investment in these programs,  These programs and funding streams are being cut by this administration and congressional Republicans. They're not only affecting jobs and livelihoods across the country in every single community represented on this committee, but they're forcing the workers to be laid off  And hence, the work that they were doing to help new Americans assimilate into our country is not being done. Refugees can no longer rely on these services. Workers can no longer rely on support from the federal government to keep the lights on. And meanwhile,  American people are watching as people, including U.S. citizens and children with cancer, are grabbed off the street by masked ICE agents in plainclothes. Migrants are mistreated at detention centers by the administration's Department of Homeland Security. And people who came here legally to seek a better life see their futures in jeopardy under Trump's policies.  And finally, I want to share my remarks about an incredibly pressing issue that this committee would be better off addressing and is suited to explore. It's already been addressed today, but all of our hearts are broken about what transpired in Texas with the flooding just a week and a half ago. And in Kerr County, Texas,  surrounding areas experiencing the unimaginable devastation and loss of life. Over 132 lives lost, over 100 still missing. And in the aftermath of this tragedy, current FEMA employees sounding the alarm about the Trump administration's slow and delayed response to Central Texas. And reporting suggesting that FEMA failed to answer many calls, thousands of calls,  from victims in the days following the flooding. So make no mistake, emergency responders and local officials in Texas carried out acts of heroism to save lives and pick up the pieces of the lives that were shattered. But this committee has an obligation  to investigate how the Trump administration's months-long degradation of FEMA, from defunding to layoffs to consolidation, played a role in these delays. 72 hours it took them to get people on the ground from FEMA into the flood zone to save lives and to help those poor people in that horrific disaster.  And I'm so disappointed that there's not been more of a measured response from Republicans to address the authority and oversight of this committee. I've sent a letter with Congressman Gabe Amo, the ranking member of the House Subcommittee with Oversight over Emergency Weather Alerts, asking the administration to address these issues. I ask you, Chairman, and my colleagues, it's our responsibility to conduct this oversight in an urgent manner moving forward. Let's address these real threats and not chase political distractions.  And on that note, I'd like to also, with unanimous consent, put into the record this op-ed from the former FEMA head, Deanne Criswell, Cuts to Federal Response Programs Guarantee Future Disasters. I yield back. Without objection, the gentleman yields. Without objection, we enter it into the record. The gentleman yields back. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Crane, for five minutes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today on how NGOs facilitated the Biden border crisis. You can see our colleagues are very upset that we're having this hearing today. They don't want to talk about this stuff. They don't want to talk about the 300,000 kids that we still don't know where they are. They're upset that President Trump got elected.  They're upset that he's doing exactly what he said he was going to do, and we're backing him up here in Congress. This is what the American people voted for because they saw four years of the carnage that these open border policies plagued on the United States. And we're talking about the NGOs that they used as middlemen to carry out their operations, like the Catholic charities they used to facilitate, normalize, and accelerate illegal immigration into this country.  Ms. Hopper, you've worked closely with trafficking victims and survivors.

I first want to start off by just advising that witnesses should definitely come here with the facts. One of the witnesses today stated that I was arrested, and that's a complete lie, and I want to put that on the record. Mr. Chairman, this hearing is a shame, a sham, and a complete disgrace.  Just because Republicans don't want to see it doesn't mean it's not true. The charities the majority is targeting are doing the Lord's work, quite literally. Republicans are trying to misrepresent and undermine and attack the work of these charities due, excuse me, these charities due to assist the most vulnerable and underserved all while quoting scripture from the Bible.  No matter what narrative my colleagues across the aisle try to spin, the truth is that these religious organizations and other nonprofits are not political.  They seek to provide aid to those who are fleeing violence and seeking asylum. To every person working at the charities, religious organizations, and other NGOs that are the subject of this hearing, I say this to you, thank you, and I am sorry. Thank you for providing the services and resources that our government has failed to provide to desperate people who are in need. And I am sorry that Republicans are trying to intimidate you and prevent you from carrying out this critical work.  I am appalled that this hearing is being used as an attempt to target religious organizations and prevent them from serving their communities in accordance with their faith. Meanwhile, the Republican majority has not done an ounce of oversight of the Trump administration, even as Trump and his administration tear apart DHS.  In January, Trump installed unelected billionaire Elon Musk as the leader of Doge and empowered him to derail and demonize critical functions across the government, including at DHS. Elon has long had massive unexplained ties to China. He did not file any kind of financial disclosure, even as he took a role in overhauling the federal government. But did the Republican majority demand any information on Musk's conflicts?  Did they ask questions about his ties to the Chinese government, a topic that draws their interest in just about every context, every week on this committee? No, they did not. Instead, they turned a blind eye to DOJ, and DOJ installed unqualified staffers across DHS, gained access to sensitive security systems, and drove off untold members of dedicated civil servants carrying out important missions to secure our homeland.  DOJ has been dismantling and reshaping DHS for six months now. Has the Republican majority held a single hearing or called a single witness to examine these massive changes to the department? No, they have not. More recently, Elon Musk and Donald Trump had a very messy breakup. Perhaps men are just too fragile and emotional for these jobs. But I digress. We did, in fact, learn a few things during this breakup. On June 6, Musk tweeted,  Time to drop the really big bomb. Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT. Wow, now that's some inside information. Elon Musk, Donald Trump's right-hand man, who spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help get Trump elected, says the president is tied to the notorious child sex predator.  And look what we're talking about today. And indeed, over the past several days, Trump has moved to permanently squash the release of the Epstein files. Now, my Republican colleagues have long expressed a desire to fight human trafficking, woohoo, talking about it today, but yet, scared to call out, to ask the administration to release the Epstein files. Surely, that must be something we can all get behind.  Surely we can all agree that if Elon Musk has evidence that Donald Trump is or has ever been involved in child sex trafficking, then Musk should be compelled to come share his evidence with this committee and the public. Now I'm sure some of my colleagues may argue that Musk is just blowing smoke, but who's to say? Let's find out.  I might have my doubts, but if you think that under oath, Musk would admit he does not actually have any evidence to back up his claims, then great. Let's find out. Let's do some real work on this committee. With that, I yield back."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 170, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 18952.546, "text": " The gentlelady yields back.

We're talking about the safety of the homeland.  about 300,000 children that right now could be being raped systematically and trafficked. And they want to talk about the boogeyman. I want to talk about the boogeyman, too. I want to talk about all the predators and the gangbangers and the murderers that were allowed into this country. Just in Nashville, the ICE raid, where they arrested murderers, rapists, traffickers, child traffickers. That's who they're protecting.  Let's talk about these 300,000 kids. How do we find them? How do we undo this mess? And oh, by the way, the idea that none of these folks are criminals, if you came into this country on false pretense, that is a crime. They're not migrants, they're illegal immigrants. And they're breaking our laws, and I've had enough of this crap. Let's talk about the facts, the facts around this hearing and these children, Ms. Hopper.  There needs to be complete coordination with the state and local agencies. They know that UACs were sent to their specific districts, their counties.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to just briefly raise my voice in favor of NGOs and the service they provided. As a law student, I worked with NGOs dedicated to immigrants, but not just to make sure that they could normalize their immigration status. I worked with immigrants  On behalf of a cause that I think all Republicans support, I worked with immigrants to help them assimilate to United States culture and identity. I helped them study for their U.S. citizenship exams, and I could see their hope, their commitment. I would even say they were more patriotic and committed to this nation than many people who are born and raised here.  I worked with NGOs to help victims of domestic violence who fled their home countries with their children fleeing from terrible, terrible, terrible life circumstances and people who found hope and security in this nation and people that I was proud to see this nation welcome  to provide them safety and security and a brighter future. So I really profoundly regret to see this Congress, to see this committee attack NGOs so broadly under a false pretext that this is really to protect the people. We are attacking people. We are attacking institutions that help people. And I want to make sure that history reflects the side that we, the Democratic Caucus, this side of the aisle stand on today.

So my first question, and I would really like to leave it open for any of you to please feel free to comment, but  It's kind of simple. How many illegals did these bad actors bring in? And how much of our hard-earned tax dollars did they spend? And did they even attempt to determine if any of the illegals that flooded our homeland were violent criminals?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 180, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 19503.683, "text": " Congresswoman, what I'll say is that it's also not just the unaccompanied minors that were processed through. There wasn't DNA testing being done with family units who were being presented and turning themselves over to Border Patrol, so there were quote-unquote family units that these NGOs also helped and processed, but you ask any border official, any border enforcement, they'll tell you that they rent kids out to act as family units or they're trafficking  these kids as family units.

With these criminal networks, we worked with a other nonprofit in California. Again, we're not against nonprofits. We are against the ones that take taxpayer dollars and mismanage the funds and abuse the funds, to reiterate for the record.  They found numerous cell phones of smugglers.

The chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Carter, for five minutes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wholeheartedly support all of my Democratic colleagues' efforts today to demand information and accountability about the cruel and profoundly un-American mass deportation agenda being undertaken by the Donald Trump administration and his allies.  as well as this administration's dereliction of duty in federal disaster response amid hurricane season. However, I would like to take a few moments to highlight a critical financial issue affecting families and businesses in Louisiana, flood insurance. Flood risk is not just a coastal issue. It affects all of us. Since 1996,  Flood events have occurred in all 50 states and 99% of them in the U.S. counties. That means nearly every single American community has experienced economic, environmental, or emotional toll of flooding. With climate change intensifying, the frequency and severity of major storms, the need for accessible, affordable, and transparent flood insurance has never been more urgent.  Unfortunately, FEMA's implementation of Risk Rating 2.0, the new methodology for calculating National Flood Insurance Program and FIP premiums, have created serious affordability problems for our constituents. Let me be clear. Congress did not pass legislation to mandate Risk Rating 2.0, nor did we have any meaningful input in its development.  FEMA claims that this overhaul falls under its administrative authority. However, FEMA bypassed a former rulemaking process, conducted no economic impact analysis, and declined to brief Congress before the implementing of one of the most sweeping changes to NFIP in its history. In fact, FEMA has continuously refused to release its full Risk Rating 2.0 methodology.  Policyholders do not have access to their property level rating factors inputs, except for the few listed on the declaration page, which are made available only after coverage is purchased. The lack of transparency is unacceptable. In my district, the consequences are real and deeply concerning. Premiums are rising drastically, and in some cases, unpredictably exasperating our ongoing housing affordability crisis.  Louisiana is not alone in this issue. There are over 1.5 million policyholders in Florida and approximately 700,000 in Texas, among others. On average, risk rating 2.0 and NFIP policies will cost $1,800, representing a 103.6 increase over legacy rates.  There are 17 states with higher average rates than Louisiana. Rates will increase by over 50% in 41 states. Some of the states with the highest average risk rates include Maine at 183% rate increase, West Virginia at 171, Mississippi at 149%, Florida at 131, and New York at 85%. Among metropolitan areas, my district in New Orleans has the second highest average insurance coverage.  behind only Miami. For working families already struggling to keep up with the mortgage payments, high insurance costs could mean having to choose between flood protection and other essential needs. Many have opted out of NFIP, altogether leaving them and their entire communities vulnerable and uninsured in the face of disaster. Within just two years of implementing Risk Rating 2.0, NFIP lost over 215,000 policyholders.  and nearly 5% of all policies. States that saw the biggest decline in policyholders were West Virginia, losing nearly 20% of policies. Oklahoma, about 18% and Texas with 15% decline. Not far behind, over one in 10 policyholders in Louisiana has opted out. This is not a partisan issue. I have been highly critical of risk rating  2.0 throughout the Biden administration with even former Secretary Mayorkas acknowledge that risk rating 2.0 is flawed. Yet during both Biden and Trump administrations, FEMA continued to push forward without correcting course, listening to Congress or properly engaging the people most affected by these changes. The bottom line is this, we need a flood insurance system that protects not penalizes American families. It should be grounded in science, equity and economic reality.  but also accountability and transparency. Congress must have a role in shaping the future of the NFIP, and our constituents deserve to know how decisions impacting their homes and livelihoods are made. Mr. Chair, I'd like to introduce the record. This research from the Coalition of Sustainable Flood Insurance, which lays out details on this issue. Without objection.  as well as a letter from the entire delegation, Louisiana delegation, bipartisan, Republican, Democrat, my dear friend, Mr. Higgins, who's not sitting here now, also signed off on this letter. Without objection, it will also be admitted. I urge my colleagues to, this letter demanding information on how public mitigation projects have impacted Louisiana. To date, we have not gotten any information. I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan, common sense legislative efforts  that will bring oversight, affordability, accountability, fairness back to the National Flood Insurance Program because flood insurance isn't something that we should wait. However, we need to do this now. Mr. Chair, pursuant to Clause 2K6, Rule 11, I move that the committee subpoena Elizabeth Asche, Assistant Administrator of the Federal Insurance Directorate of FEMA, to provide this committee with the details and agencies it has been withholding from Congress.  Is there a motion? There is a motion. Move to table. Motion to table. The gentleman moves to table. The motion to table is privileged and non-debatable.

At this time, then, the chair would recognize Mr. Evans for five minutes for his questioning.  Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, of course, to the witnesses for coming. And Mr. Chairman, I'd like to submit for the record this committee's report from last year in which then-CBP chief patrol agents told the committee that, quote, NGOs will facilitate the migrants' travel plans to wherever that's going to be while they wait for their immigration hearing. And, quote, once they're released from our custody, the NGOs then provide them with potentially transportation up to the Phoenix area or other areas of the interior to help them make travel arrangements, things like that.  Without objection, the document will be entered into the record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And also for the record, a statement by now CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott in this same report, in which he says that cartels and NGOs actually coach would-be border crossers on claiming asylum after being apprehended by the Border Patrol. Without objection, it will be entered into the record.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And for everybody that stuck with us through today, I think it's been extremely clear that certain NGOs have benefited significantly from the Biden administration's open border policies to the point where they actually found migrants before they reached the border to encourage them  to illegally enter the United States in return for all of the amnesty and other benefits they could obtain. More benefits, in fact, than many American citizens receive, including free cell phones and upscale hotel stays. Mr. Howell, first question will be to you. Your organization's in-depth study tracked devices given to illegal immigrants by border NGOs and showed, unsurprisingly, that my part of the world, Denver, Colorado, and the surrounding areas,  was one of their more popular final destinations. The sanctuary state policies in Colorado and Denver have allowed NGOs and government entities to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to provide services to illegal immigrants and have proliferated crime in our area, making Colorado this year the second most dangerous state in the country.  When the Biden admin and Democrats in Colorado reimburse NGOs to provide these services and benefits, how does that incentivize illegal immigration and encourage criminal enterprises to conduct business in the United States and in places like Denver and Colorado?  Simply put, if you build it, they will come. It is a completely cost-free for the illegal alien transportation and funding stream with everything they could ever need or want, things beyond what are even applied or given to our poor and needy in the United States. It also takes a lot of pressure off the cartels and makes it much easier for them to sell in the first instance for an illegal to come to the border in the first place. And don't take my word for it, look how the border is secure now. People aren't even trying to come because they know these benefits  aren't available to them even in the event they're able to get in.  Thank you. Ms. Hopper, next question will be to you. I was a cop and a soldier for about 22 years combined, and I am Latino. And unfortunately, I know through those experiences and others exactly how bad the crime situation is in Colorado. We're the national headquarters for Tren de Aragua, which I think we all know now, violent Venezuelan prison gang that does a lot of bad things to include human trafficking.  You have substantial experience in the dangers that unaccompanied minors face on their journey to the border and then once released into the United States. Currently, the federal government is trying to review sponsors in Colorado. We've heard earlier today, over 300,000 kids that we're trying to track down.  Federal government has reached out to Colorado to try to see if these kids that may be in Colorado are in safe environments. However, state laws in Colorado that my governor has signed more than once are preventing the release of this basic information to federal investigators and obstructing the ability to do just basic safety checks.  How do state policies that restrict federal oversight of unaccompanied minors and NGOs that fail to properly screen these sponsors enable cartels like Tren de Aragua and MS-13 to exploit or recruit children in the United States and then again specifically in sanctuary jurisdictions like Colorado?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 198, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 21404.431, "text": "It absolutely encourages cartels  and criminal networks to direct their activity to sanctuary cities and states, knowing that those protections will exist for them, and knowing that there isn't that cooperation and federal oversight and accountability for that. So unfortunately, I don't know what the motivation is for your state's governor, and I'm sorry for that, because of the fact that that isn't helping these children, that isn't helping the citizens  of Colorado that isn't helping your constituents when you're protecting illegal aliens over that of those that elected you."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 199, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 21444.011, "text": "Thank you, and I got four seconds. Chairman, yield back. The gentleman yields back. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I'm concerned about children. I'm concerned about the 37 children  who've lost their lives to the Guadalupe River in Texas. I'm concerned that we're not having a hearing to address the needs of these families. These are people who had their children at a summer camp. They expected to pick their children up.  They didn't expect to see their children waste away. Many of them haven't been found. I'm concerned about children, too. But I'm concerned about all children. I don't segregate children. I don't conclude that some children have lives that are worth more than others. I want to see something done about those children. Why aren't we having a hearing to deal  with the needs of the people of the state of Texas. And other states too that may have similar needs. I don't segregate. I integrate children. Let's do something about all children. And to proclaim this hearing to be one that is related to charities. I'm going to defend Catholic charities.  I don't believe you think that Catholic Charities would have 65,000 children mistreated. I just don't believe you think that. I don't think so. Catholic Charities does an outstanding job. I would love to think that we could resolve all of these things today, but apparently we cannot.  Let me go to something that I think would be relevant for this hearing as it relates to the state of Texas. This, my friends, is a picture of Mr. David Richardson, missing. Have you seen the acting FEMA administrator? Where is he?  Why is he not here to help us understand what's happening to those children in Texas, to explain to those parents why FEMA has been feckless and ineffective? I have intelligence in my hand indicating that an internal FEMA assessment ordered by David Richardson,  the current senior official performing the duties of FEMA administrator dated May 12, 2025, paint a dire and deeply troubling picture. According to these internal reviews, FEMA is fundamentally unprepared to respond to national emergencies due to severe workforce reductions, hello,  workforce reductions, terminated contracts, and systemic management under the current Trump administration. I care about all children. I want to help resolve any issues that we have with children. I don't want to see us decide  that we can't have a hearing to deal with this man who's missing in action. Let me have this, please. Missing in action. Missing at a time when he ought to be on the ground in the state of Texas. Where is he? Why aren't we subpoenaing him? Why don't we get him here? Well, let's find out if we really are serious about children. Let's find out if we can get him here. Mr. Chairman,  Given that the secretary won't appear and can't be subpoenaed because you've already taken that issue up, pursuant to Clause 2K6 of Rule 11, I move that the committee subpoena David Richardson, senior official performing the duties of FEMA administrator. I want to see where you stand.  Why can't we have him here? Why can't he come in and talk about it? You have these three witnesses here to talk about the other children? Good. Let's get him here.

At this time, the chair would recognize the gentleman from the great state of Pennsylvania, Mr. McKenzie.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it is truly an honor to be a member of the Homeland Security Committee, where we deal with so many important issues on a daily basis. And the breadth of the topics that we are faced with dealing with and discussing is quite extensive. I look forward to continuing the work of this committee on a wide range of issues, some of them raised here today as we move forward. But the topic at hand  is the failings of the Biden administration and how NGOs facilitated the Biden border crisis, where millions of people entered our country illegally during those four years. Within that, there was a subset of children. 300,000 children were not effectively monitored, and their whereabouts were sometimes unknown.  That was questioned by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and fact checks were done on that. And what did the fact checks come back with? They said, well, you know, the 300,000, it wasn't that they were effectively monitored, but there were just 32,000 who didn't show up for a court case. And so they were at a greater risk of sex trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor. 32,000 children  who are left vulnerable. And my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want to ask a single question about that. They don't want to talk about that topic. They want to sweep it under the rug. They want to turn a blind eye. They want to pretend that it didn't happen during the Biden administration because it is politically inconvenient. The welfare of children is something that they don't want to talk about all of a sudden because it happened under a Democratic administration.  We have documented cases of rape of children, children working in extremely dangerous conditions. And those unaccompanied minors, when they went to do welfare checks on them, they're unaccounted for, simply gone. But they don't want to ask any questions about that. They don't want to talk about it. And so we have a responsibility as the adults in the room to govern, to do oversight, to do these questions that come before this committee to make sure every American is safe.  And as a state representative, I contacted the Biden administration about this very issue. They didn't respond. I contacted our Democratic governor. He didn't respond. Nobody wants to talk about this issue of missing children in our country. So I am glad we are having this hearing today because we need to get some answers. And so my first question is for Mr. Howell. I want to understand the flow of money  what appropriation, what line item it was in, where it went to DHS, and how it moved to either states to facilitate the movement of these children or to NGOs. So for the DHS money, most of it went out through FEMA and the SSP program, which was renamed about halfway through the Biden administration. It used to be called something else. There'd be a series of grant-making exercises. A lot of them are publicly posted online where you can see the main organizations that received it. And after that, there are subgrants and other things. It's very difficult  to follow the money all the way from federal government to end recipient, let alone the usage. So it went through FEMA, which is intended for emergency management in situations like we faced in Texas and was just talked about, but the money was gone. It was used for these programs, you're telling me. That's absolutely correct. And they begged for more time and time again. Simply astonishing that the money would be used in that way and not for the safety of the American public in emergency situations.  The next question I have is for Ms. Hopper. Who is supposed to have the accountability and responsibility for the well-being of the children? When they move from one agency to the other, does the accountability and responsibility hand off to the next organization, or is it Homeland Security, since they did the initial intake, they're the ones who should be held ultimately accountable?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 206, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 22229.355, "text": "It's a very good question. A lot of these agencies are pointing fingers at each other, and without a clear established  person or group or agency that's responsible. You had Border Patrol that had 48 hours to move these children, these men, these women through. Then they went to HHS, which, depending on the situation, would outsource that responsibility to NGOs.  without that clear oversight on who was responsible. It makes it challenging to hold people accountable, but at the end of the day, I would look to whoever is issuing the grant. There is a scope, there are deliverables, there is requirements that need to be met, and so the grant issuer is responsible for managing that contract to make sure everything is being met before issuing more monies."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 207, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 22281.95, "text": " I appreciate that.

Mr. Chairman, it's good to be here. Thank you for having this hearing. To the witnesses, I would say thank you. I think I owe you another thank you. This has been quite a long hearing and unfortunately the Democrats have obstructed, they've distracted, and they've refused to engage in this topic because it shows that their narrative that they have authored is false.  that what happened at the border was just perfectly in line with the norm. It was beneficial to the country. There was nothing they could do about it. Whatever narrative they've written, it is false. This was a designed.  intentional and protected endeavor to bring millions of people into this country regardless of the consequences. It was designed by the Biden-Harris administration and the Democrats on this committee are still defending it. It's just astounding. They will not say this hurts the American people. Unchecked illegal immigration hurts the American people. We could go on and on. I want to give you all some time to talk. Mr. Howell, starting with you.  One of our esteemed colleagues on the other side declared that what happened at the Biden border was not politically motivated. It was all charity. Do you agree with that statement?  Absolutely not. It was a highly coordinated plan executed by some of the most radical elements of this country for the sole purposes of ushering in a massive border crisis which caused tremendous damage and is still being defended to this day. Does that affect the electoral count or congressional apportionment? Absolutely, it affects the census. Do you think that that is lost on Democratic governors, senators and congressmen and the Biden-Harris administration? It is absolutely not. Was there a plan to send them to politically sensitive states?  I think they send them everywhere, but the highest concentrations are the urban areas, which are clearly a benefit to the Democrats. Was there evidence that these individuals here illegally were coached on how to register to vote, where to go, what to say, how to evade capture from immigration officials?  Correct. It's happening still today with these nonprofits coaching them on how to evade. As for the voting, as this country's voting system became a laughingstock with the mass mail-in ballots, we have evidence from the Biden White House of a listening session they held with these radical activists where they were encouraging the Biden White House not to even ask people if they were citizens before trying to register them to vote. It's worth noting that the Democratic Party is staunchly and uniformly against voter ID, no matter what state has been proposed. Just a random thought.

Now, I've got one more question, Mr. Rosa. I want to give you a chance to respond to Mr. Green.  He looked right at you and said, he didn't believe that you really thought that children were mistreated by a charity with the name Catholic. And I want to make a distinction. It was not an extension of the Catholic church. This was a uniformly named charity with the word Catholic in it. But I want to give you a chance to respond.  Well, yeah, because the reason why that was just a weird thing to say is because the people at the border, they know how these things work, right? This isn't new. So these NGOs, not just Catholic Charities, a whole bunch of them, they knew that the vetting wasn't done, that this was being done haphazardly because of the volume, right? The volume overwhelmed the system. And so there are shortcuts that need to be taken. By design. By design, exactly.  They still took the money to do that. They knew that these children were being abused. Before they arrived at the border, there was probably going to happen after they got to their final destination, whether it's a workplace or sexual abuse. And they still took the money because it was taxpayer dollars. And they increased their pockets.  It's very frustrating because I've seen children as young as seven crossing by themselves. I saw a girl hold a two-year-old, just them. So, you know, he doesn't know me. A lot has been said about our credibility, but I've been there and I've seen it and this was a big problem.  Well, I'll close with this again. This was the biggest problem that I have seen in my lifetime. It's going to take decades to fix, and it's astounding that the Democratic Party not only built it, not only implemented it, but they are still defending it. And the American people need to know that if they get back in power, those open border policies and the flood of mass migration will return. We cannot let that happen. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Knott.  With consultation with the ranking member, there are no closing statements in this matter. I would like to thank our witnesses for being with us today, and would like to remind our witnesses that members of the committee may have additional questions for you, and we would ask the witnesses to respond to these in writing.

And the data have been much better. Even the sort of the pet metric that Jay Powell likes is the super core metric, which is  consumer services, excluding rents, that's about 150 basis points lower than where it was last September, when the Fed first began cutting rates. So, I totally understand the president's frustration.

But my colleague in the CEA, Steven Myron, wrote a great paper. His team did a great job looking at import prices that would have direct impact from tariffs. Those prices actually fell. So, what's happening is, they're adjusting the price as it comes in, and they're building that tariff into their margin.  That's fine. But they're paying it. But they're not paying it because if they were paying it, we would see it in the inflation data.

A similar argument was made that, well, we had this big inventory build in the first quarter, and, therefore, companies aren't going to raise prices, which made no sense, because demand has been strong, and you're going to raise the price if you can get away with it. But the fact is, the U.S. is the world's largest consumer.  We dictate the terms. President Trump knows, from a negotiating standpoint, everybody wants to be in the U.S. market.

On the year-over-year data, they were a little bit warm.  So, for the most part, if I had to summarize, PPI didn't really change much of the landscape. But then again, at 10.54 Eastern Time, everything got a bit weird with the headlines coming out about Mr. Trump firing Powell. My first reaction was, sorry, don't believe it. Some balloons getting floated here. I think he knows, Bassett knows. I think they all know that they can't. But anyway, let's go to the markets. Let's go to the whiteboard. 30-year yields.  We're hovering right around 5% at 1054 Eastern. They moved up to 507 and a half, and this chart is static, so it ends around 115 Eastern. But you see the point. And once again, I'm going to ask the only question all my sources were asking. I do think Jerome Powell's worth a little bit more than 7 and a half basis points, don't you?

And it's the one maturity that's still holding a bit of that. But do keep in mind, we had cooler-than-expected PPI.  Commodity that wins, the trade that wins, the most volatility is the dollar index. It was at 98.70, it broke down to 97.80, a little less than a full cent move. But do keep in mind, it bounced right back A and B.

Heading into earnings, one of the key things that we're watching is this feedback loop between corporate margins, the layoff rate, which is still low, consumer spending, and overall economic activity. Right now, if you can see this on the Bloomberg terminal,  Average EBITDA margins for IG are above 20%. Average EBITDA margins for high yield are above 30%. So what we're watching is, is there pressure on those margins because of higher input costs, for example, and do corporates flex that layoff tool more aggressively? But going back to the earlier discussion, actually, I think we've been pleasantly surprised at the multitude of levers that corporates can flex here.

Of course, we need a surplus for 12 different months. But if you look into why did the month of June actually have a surplus and not a deficit spin, it's because of the increased tax revenues, but also the increased tariff revenues. Those are the two biggest issues that led to making sure that government was balanced for the month of June. So tariffs do play a part of the role.

You need certainty in the tax code.

I mean, equity trading up 36 percent, prime brokerage, cash, derivatives. We talked about the fact that we saw record trading on the equities exchanges this quarter. We certainly saw that come through at the banks. M&A, Goldman talking about the fact that announced volumes are up 30 percent and we're running above average now, so that bodes well for the future.

So if  this quarter we don't see them participate and kind of follow that Morgan Stanley lead. That will give us further proof that they're actually losing share in their home market and that should be a little bit more concerning."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 432.363, "text": "I mean you could argue that the horse is already out of the barn.

So any changes, I think Elliot is going to try, through Bob, to effect a lot of changes at HPE. Mooj, just remind us, what HPE is today, number one. And number two, what do they need to fix to move this thing forward?  Yeah, hey Paul. So HPE is one of the leading enterprise IT infrastructure vendors. They provide servers, storage, now a bigger networking presence with the Juniper acquisition. And actually, quite frankly, there's quite a bit to fix.  From an operational standpoint, they fumbled the first quarter results by mispricing their server business. And it seems to be reconciled now, but it flagged some of the operational issues, number one. Number two, they have made a lot of M&A.  that just didn't create the synergies that they had hoped. So, you know, they did hire the former HP CFO to streamline the financials.

And we think about high-performance compute, they are the market leaders there. HPE has not been able to transition that Cray business elegantly to the AI side of things. So let me put this into context.  I think HPE should be on track for about $3 to $4 billion in AI sales this year, possibly $4 to $5 billion. Dell is going to be on track for about $15 billion this year, and Supermicro is probably on track for about $20 billion this year.  So, you know, they've lagged on the AI front even though they have some of the leading technologies and high-performance compute. That's an area that, you know, could be fixable under the right hands. One more here before we let you go, Wooj. You mentioned they own Cray, they own Juniper. If I'm Elliott Management, am I thinking about maybe they could be selling or spinning off some of these businesses to enhance value?  Well, Bob Calderoni used to be on the Juniper board, and they actually helped with the operational streamlining of Juniper. So I think you want to keep Juniper. There are other aspects of the networking business that you could probably parse away. The Cray business, you'd want to keep, because AI is going to be the growth engine and also help you transition to the enterprise AI.  All right, Woojin Ho, thank you so much for joining us.

I could not tell you what European tariffs will be. We know the UK will be 10 percent, so it's good for Scotch.

It's very difficult to pin down your earnings estimates.  and they've obviously been falling for about 18 months, two years now, to really say that the recovery is coming, because we just don't know whether it's going to be 200%, which was rumoured at some point after April, or it could go down to 10.

I cover a number of Midwest banks like PNC and Huntington, and they're growing.  in the higher-growth areas, in the sun-dealt areas. That's something that we see ongoing, changing the mix of the demographic growth for that company.  How did the regional banks compete with private credit? A lot of the private credit funds that we talked to, at least at the beginning, they started out targeting the mid-market, middle-sized market companies, not like the big multi-gajillion dollar deals. But that's right where those regional banks like to play. How's that dynamic, competitive dynamic working?  Yeah, it's been interesting. I would say that for a lot of the regionals, there's not a lot of direct competition quite yet. I would say the private credit folks are catering to a more riskier company.  For example, we've taken a look at this a little bit, where the private credit companies are, you're talking about loan yields north of 10%, whereas the traditional middle market bank borrower is much more stable.

Credit quality, specifically commercial real estate, there was concern that if there was going to be a problem in our financial system from some falling, particularly office real estate, that we'd see it in the middle-sized regional banks. Have we seen that?  Yeah, I would say that's an ongoing issue. We've seen losses continue, but they're manageable. Office commercial real estate on average for the companies that I cover in the large regional bank space is about 2% of their total loan.  portfolio. So, it's manageable.

NVIDIA's CEO says he anticipates getting the first batch of US licenses to export H20 AI chips to China very soon. Plus more from Crypto Week on the Hill after Trump says the House will pass the Genius Act stable corn bill today. And Elon Musk's ex-AI is in discussions to lease data center capacity in Saudi Arabia. We bring you the Bloomberg exclusive.  Good morning. Let's get right to markets. And we are very focused right now on the chip sector. A.S.M.L. These are the Dutch shares trading in Amsterdam of the world's leading chip equipment maker or chip making equipment maker. The story is really clear. The vision they've given us for 2026 they are not holding to that in terms of  grow for a year of growth. But what really spooked the markets was a comment from the CFO about how right now chip makers and customers are very worried about tariffs. We'll go deeper later in the hour. Then you have NVIDIA. So actually NVIDIA was kind of not doing much this morning. We know that Jensen Wang is in China talking up the success of being able to sell in a limited way some chips back into that market.  Over the course of three days, we had a big gain yesterday, pushing the market cap well beyond $4 trillion. We're giving some of that back this morning. The anxiety in this Wednesday session is slightly linked to, let's say, the jitters from ASML. Anyway, Jensen Wang's been talking up a storm. Listen to this.  Some of the things that we wrote off might be harder to recover, but most of the things that we put on reserve will not be scrapped permanently, was not scrapped permanently. So we'll compare what customers would like to buy now versus the inventory that we have, and then we can figure that out. It's probably not 100%, but it's not 0% either.  Let's get more on NVIDIA and the relaxation of some of those chip cards. Bloomberg's Mike Shepard joins us out of D.C. and Jensen Wang's appeared a number of times actually in the last 12 to 24 hours in Beijing, in China. And let's say he's basking a little bit in what is a big win for him and a big win for the company.  Well, that's fair to say, because this really was a big turnabout by the Trump administration in basically lifting these export curbs on the H-20 that it had imposed just back in April. And much to NVIDIA's chagrin, it prompted the company to take a $4.5 billion write-down in the previous quarter, and it had been looking at losses of perhaps as much as  $8 billion in sales for the current quarter. So this is a potentially big gain. And Jensen Wang is saying that he is expecting those licenses very soon, Ed, although he didn't give an exact timeline. And there's still some unanswered questions about that, too, the scope of it.  We don't know exactly what this backlog of orders that Jensen is saying are still on the books that they can fulfill very quickly once they get the licenses. And it's also not clear whether the permission that the U.S. government now is signaling that it will start giving extends beyond the inventory that Jensen was talking about that have been held up by the restrictions that were imposed.  Likewise, we don't know if this will be a rubber stamp process by the U.S. In other words, will it be quick, as Jensen is suggesting, or will there be some bureaucratic tangles here? So there are some questions about how far this goes and whether this might extend to future chips that NVIDIA may try to sell there.  Bureaucratic tangles. There's also the political entanglement as well. There's been a lot of headlines, I think, in the last 24 hours with Jensen Wang in the center of them because he is in China. And there's a timing question because he met with the President of the United States last week. Do we use NVIDIA as any kind of sign that the relationship between the two countries, the United States and China, is evolving or changing in real time as well?  You know, it really does fit into the broader picture of how U.S.-China relations are really evolving fairly quickly. Since Liberation Day, when Donald Trump imposed these eye-watering tariffs on the world's second largest economy, really prompting a reckoning between Washington and Beijing and forcing  negotiators from both sides to sit down and really hash it out over trade. They didn't get too far into the weeds, but they did address some of the key issues, and they included export controls. The U.S. has been concerned that China had been holding back on sales of rare earths elements to American customers, and likewise, Beijing had been complaining about export controls, like the ones that we are talking about, applying to  the H20 chip, but also to chip design software and other elements. So we got a sense that there has been a little bit of a quid pro quo, something that Treasury Secretary Scott Besson acknowledged during his interview with our colleague Ann Marie Hordern yesterday morning, and something that we are seeing fitting into this broader pattern  of perhaps a little bit more rapprochement. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been meeting with his Chinese counterparts to try to set the stage for a summit between President Donald Trump and his counterpart, Chinese President Xi Jinping, sometime before the end of the year. And likewise, Trump has also been signaling a softer tone. He's saying that he will fight China in a friendly fashion.  And likewise, according to reporting from our colleagues Jenny Leonard and Mackenzie Hawkins, inside the room, inside those meetings, at the White House, Trump is one of the least hawkish voices when it comes to China. Bloomers, Mike Shepard in Washington, DC. Thank you very much. Let's stick with the semiconductor space broadly. This is shares of ASML, right, the world's most important leading edge maker of lithography machines, EUV lithography. They're used to manufacture chips.  And what has happened this morning is the company's walked back its forecast for next year, 2026. Let's go out to London and Bloomberg's Henry Wren. That is a part of the story, right? So in that European session, the stock's off lows, but down more than 10%, Henry. The other part was the CFO saying, our customers are really worried about tariffs right now. Give us the summary.  Yes, yes indeed. So usually every quarter when ASL trades, it trades about its orders intake number. This quarter, the order intake number is satisfactory. It beat estimates. However, one line in this press release really caught traders' attention and that's CEO saying that although the company is still preparing for growth for 2026, the company really couldn't confirm that at this stage.  Because that contrasted with the company's messaging about three months ago, saying that, based on its client conversations, at that time, 2026 was still expected to be a year of growth. So this really dampens the sentiment, as you mentioned. We see sell-downs in some other chip equipment companies today as well, including Applied Materials, KLA in the US, as well as ASMI-B Semiconductor as well in the Netherlands.  What about the course of gone? I mean is there any sense of how the health of the business is right now? Yes, so let's talk about, let's focus on the EUV first because that's the most important growth factor for the company and according to the order intake that we've been seeing the past quarter it does seem that TSMC has been putting into more orders which is  ASML's most important customer. However, for many other customers, the uncertainty level is on the rise. We talked about, you know, the Trump administration is backtracking many of its eye-watering tariffs. However, based on the conversations ASML has with many of its clients, it does seem that the uncertainty level is on the rise rather than on the decline. ASML explained that it's because of two reasons. On the direct side,  You still have this Section 232 investigation going on in the U.S., which means the tariffs imposed to chips and chipmaking equipment is still unknown. And on the other hand, you have this tariff impact on the economy, which many chipmakers are more concerned about. So on the direct and indirect side, the company is getting more cautious. Its customers are getting more cautious. So that's probably why you see the company walking back its guidance a bit today.  Bloomberg's Henry ran out of London, thank you very much. Let's get to the chip and AI sectors in greater depth with an investor, Jay Hatfield, CEO, CIO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. It's hard to know whether to start on trade and policy or the politics of the day between America and China or the idiosyncratic that Henry was going through, but right now  Tariffs seems to connect all of those things. What are you seeing across the technology sector in how investors are responding to tariffs, but also how the companies themselves are communicating the impact?  Thanks, Ed. It's great to be back on. Well, the way we look at tariffs is they're actually very positive for the US and very negative for the rest of the world. And you're seeing that today with ASML. But US companies are mostly, except maybe Apple, mostly unaffected by the tariffs. A lot of them have local manufacturing. So you continue to see tech stocks lead the market. But what I think most people are missing  is the revenue benefit to the U.S. So we're forecasting $300 billion of revenue from tariffs, which is really the run rate right now. And we're also forecasting that the budget deficit declines next year to $1.4 trillion only.  That's only four and a half percent of GDP. So nobody else is really looking at those numbers. It is good for the U.S. to collect revenue, pay down or have less of a deficit, which ultimately will be invested and help the economy.  Jay, I think the top story over the course of several days has been Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, now being more free in a limited way to sell chips back into China. It's a headline and it's a single company, but what does that signal to you on the policy side about how America will continue to trade with China?  Well, I think what you're saying is that the Trump administration, notwithstanding the tariffs, which can be negative for a lot of companies, and trade restrictions, which hurt NVIDIA three or four months ago, is that they are pro-business. And if you lobby the administration, they are open to changing  Policy so ultimately that's going to support the stock market's going to be bullish for tech companies So they're just way more practical than the prior administration and way more pro-business you track a series of economic indicators, right and  What is your projection on the net effect of this administration's policy? Do you see growth near medium term, long term? Or what do you think we're being set up for going forward on the fiscal side?  Well, it's fairly complicated, because tariffs are negative for the economy in the very short run, because you just take, it's really like a sales tax, so you take buying power away from consumers. But the real issue is the Fed is misanalyzing tariffs. They're not treating them as one time. They're sticking with their archaic expectations theory of inflation, that tariffs  might cause expectations and spiral out of control, which we think is no longer the case. Sorry to interrupt you. Let me ask you this. That's your view on this current Fed administration, right? I have to acknowledge that in the markets right now, there is movement across assets on the reports and speculation about what the administration may or may not do vis-a-vis Fed Chairman Powell, right? I think we see that in the markets.  What do you make of that, a potential change? And I'd note for our audience, right, this is Bloomberg Tech. We talk about tech companies and the value on their future earnings. So rates impact that equation, right? Take it from there.  Well, we actually have a differentiated view that if, in fact, the Fed chair gets replaced, of course, the stock market probably would react negatively. That would just be a buying opportunity for a couple of reasons. First of all, the Powell Fed has been tremendously behind the curve.  They use a flawed CPI. So they're always about two years behind the curve. But also, a new Fed chair is not going to have super loose monetary policy. They'll just have normal monetary policy. And they have to deal with the existing board, which has, the core board has four Democrats on it. So they're not going to be all powerful. They're not going to lower rates too quickly. And it's important to note that rates are ultra tight now. So we really, really need a cut.  That was in the context of media reports on the president's consideration of whether or not he can or will fire Fed Chair Jay Powell. Bloomberg's not verified that reporting. But as we discussed, Jay, we see it in the markets. Jay Hatfield of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, great to have you back on the show. Thank you.

You are actually making a more U.S. spec economy in the world which is really big for U.S. dollars and the United States governments. And I think that's why President Trump is really pushing for it.  Secondly it does legitimate everything around crypto with respect to USD denominated currency. It will give a big high for the prices and Bitcoin Ethereum and all the other stuff which we are looking at denominated in USD. So that's a very big one.

We look towards the future of energy as data center demand sees no signs of slowing down. Data center is everywhere at the moment. So much more to discuss. This is Bloomberg Tech.  Welcome back to Bloomberg Tech. Let's get back to the story from earlier in the hour. Bloomberg reporting citing a White House official that President Trump is likely to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell very soon. The market reaction was in the U.S. dollar but we also saw G10 peers climb on those headlines. Bloomberg also confirming earlier reporting that  Yesterday, the president met with GOP lawmakers to discuss whether or not he ought to oust Fed Chair Jay Powell. That's what we'll keep tracking. Markets are moving in real time. Also thinking a lot about the semiconductor space because of ASML's earnings. Right. That is a big story right now. They scrapped their year of growth forecast for 2026. But the big headline that spooked investors  is that the CFO is saying customers are very worried about tariffs. These are shares that we're trading in Amsterdam. The market in Europe now closed. But that is a big drop almost 11 percent. Those are the public markets. Let's go from public markets to private markets. A story I broke with colleagues yesterday. Space X is planning an insider share sale that would value the company at about 400 billion dollars. That's a  according to our sources. The per share price is $212, and that's up substantially from the $185 set in the prior transaction. That was December. This deal marks a rapidly climbing value for Musk's rocket and satellite maker, which is now the most valuable private startup.  in the world. Sticking with Mr. Musk, Elon Musk's AI startup, XAI, is in discussions to lease data center capacity in Saudi Arabia. That's according to sources. It's all part of an effort to expand infrastructure in regions offering cheap energy but also political goodwill. I want to get out to our AI editor, Seth Figgerman, who joins us on the story. Seth, this is something we reported with colleagues in Europe and in the Middle East this morning. My understanding is  from sources, there's one key name, which is Humane. That's who XAI is talking to. What do we need to know here? You know, I think this is one of the rare providers in the region that could probably get XAI, you know, several gigawatts of capacity in the coming years. And it speaks to, I think, the scope of Elon's ambition. You know, it was only a year or so ago that people were still scratching their heads about what he wanted to do.  With XAI, we're really sat in the ecosystem. Now we're looking at a company that is technically valued at around $200 billion and expanding infrastructure at a scale that's starting to rival OpenAI and Meta, though perhaps not quite at the same level yet. Of course, what we're waiting to hear is now what's the product, what's the revenue stream, all of that. That makes it a big business.  Right, so in Memphis, Tennessee, you have Colossus, hyperscale data center footprint. The rest of the reporting is that, you know, they might also be looking at the UAE. There's a relationship with G42 and Elon Musk. They might be looking at Africa. The main thing is, you just mentioned it, the products. Where is XAI at? You know, Grok 4 was this big moment on social media, but what do we know about the model and its capabilities?  Yeah, I mean, this still feels like a company that's making more headlines for the controversies than for the capabilities of its products. That said, it does seem to be hitting benchmarks that are comparable to some of the leading providers out there, including OpenAI. But what we have not seen really from XAI yet is it play a real central role in the business and developer ecosystem. This is not a company that's partnered and done deals with a bunch of Fortune 500 brands. It's not necessarily a central tool for  developers and software engineers, they are starting to implement higher price tiered products that might start to jam up revenue, but I don't know that we've really seen it prove the business case yet, but who knows where it goes in the next six months.  Bloomberg, Seth Ligaming, thank you very much for joining us. Let's get more on the race for AI data centers. Katherine Huff, University of Illinois, a Barna Champagne Associate Professor, somebody that has also held multiple roles in the Department of Energy across the U.S. government. That report just there, I broke it with colleagues this morning in the Middle East.  But what's interesting about it was my understanding is XAI Musk's rationale is to look to regions where energy is cheapest, which puts a reflection on the state of play in this country as well.

Katie just explained a bit of it there. At Bloomberg Green in Seattle yesterday, long-term, long-time, well-known Silicon Valley investor Vinod Khosla discussed the types of energy he thinks can fuel our future AI ambitions.  The change in demand is what has caused the problem. Now, nimbyism like grid again is going to be a problem, but data centers don't need the grid. You can put the data center where the power source is. So I do think grid helps, but the demand problem is created by the projected increase in demand from AI data centers, which can be located near power sources.  Coming up, 19 Labs launches its first commercial drone flight, successfully delivering medicine in Guyana. We're going to speak with 19 Labs CEO Ram Fish. What's next? This is Bloomberg Tech.  This is Bloomberg Tech. You're looking at a live shot of the principal room. Check out the Bloomberg Tech podcast. You can find it on the Terminal, as well as online on Apple, Spotify, and on iHeart. This is Bloomberg Tech.  19 Labs is taking telehealth to the skies. The company has launched its Galeforce drone, powered by Starlink and NVIDIA AI, to autonomously deliver medicine and digital health toolkits. For more, I want to bring in 19 Labs CEO, Ram Fish, who's with us here in San Francisco. So the first kind of case study or successful, should we call it a mission, is in Guyana. What did you achieve and why that nation in particular?  We've been working in Ghana for the last few years. The president and the government over there is very eager to use technology to improve the country and use the new found money from gas to actually have a positive impact. So we've been building a public-private partnership with them for the last few years.  bringing advanced technology, starting with telemedicine, and now launching the drone delivery of medication, and bringing back from those rural indigenous communities blood samples or other goods to the regional hospitals. Can we talk a little bit about the technology? You know, I cover NVIDIA very closely, and for a long time, Jensen Huang's been telling me about real-world AI and physical AI. You use NVIDIA as a partner. How does that work?  There are two technologies that are transforming what we can do in those remote places. Traditionally, you haven't been able to go there physically. Drone is changing this. And you haven't been able to communicate. Drones is changing this. The NVIDIA piece comes on top of it, allows us to automate and monitor and perform drone operation in a much safer, more autonomous way.  And that directly ties into the costs. And when you are dealing with the next one billion people in rural population, one of the major considerations is innovating at the cost point. That's why NVIDIA is transformative here as well. On the data side, or you have physical silicon inside of the...  physical silicon inside because the AI is moving to the edge. So we actually have both the Starlink on the drone and the NVIDIA on the drone to do real-time processing of what's happening on the drone so it can fly autonomously in a safe way. That's astonishing. Starlink is available in so many formats and mediums, industrial scale, on airplanes, in the home. How did you negotiate with them to get a receiver locally onto the drone?  The Starlink Mini is kind of the smallest model of the Starlinks. Drones are, you know, we're not talking about the DGI small drone. We are looking on something that's better be called unmanned aircraft. And these are just growing.  every year now. Like, we can carry 25 pounds this year, by next we are looking at 150 pounds unmanned aircraft. So yeah, you put a Starlink on it, and the moment you put Starlink, you completely transform how you can fly, because the pilot can sit, view the weather, view the physical location, monitor throughout the flight. Very low latency. Almost no latency, sits with a joystick. You know, in the past, those technologies have only been available for expensive military usage.  We believe in drones for good, and the Starlink has been able to enable us to transform this, put the Starlink on the drones and offer those services. Ram, in my study and research of you, I know you to be more kind of involved in the smartphone market, historically working at Apple, other OEMs. How did you get into drones?  Oh, I've always been into aviation since I was a kid. And if you think about a drone nowadays, a drone is no longer that much of an aero challenge or aerospace challenge. A drone is much more of a computer with sensor.  and models and software and communications that you need to come together. Well, that's what I did at Apple. That's what I did in Samsung leading digital health. And that's where I started when I built the first phone in the world. It had a browser in 95. It's building the hardware and the software together to create amazing products.  Just very quick, you know, Zipline's a company that we've covered on this program deeply. It's very analogous in many ways to what you're doing. They've been able to scale in different markets. Do you see them as the main competitor? Do you try to emulate them? I think they're absolutely a fantastic company and they're doing amazing things. We try to take a slightly different approach than them.  They are much more vertically integrated and everything needs to be technology powered. We believe in achieving balance between what I call AI and Agi. There is a space to use humans in the operation of drones, especially in rural indigenous places. And being able to balance, you know, you can have local people charge the drones, unpack the drones, have it land in the communities. It also means that you empower and educate local people.  Rumfish, 19 Lab CEO, thank you very much. We've got to get out to Washington DC and Bloomberg's Kayleigh Lyons and speak more about headlines that President Trump very likely to fire Fed Chair Powell. Kayleigh, update me, what's the latest?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 34, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 2290.441, "text": " Yeah, Bloomberg is reporting this, according to a White House official familiar with the matter, though they do caution, Ed, that no final decision has yet been made. But yes, it does seem that the president may be getting closer to the point where he makes the call to at least try to fire the Fed chair, Jerome Powell. And he spoke about this, we understand, with Republican lawmakers who were gathered at the White House.  Tuesday evening here in Washington. The New York Times, in fact, actually reporting that he waved in front of them a draft letter of his firing of Chairman Powell. So there certainly is an escalation in what has been an ongoing feud, if you will, at least one-sided feud between the Trump White House and the Fed chairs. The president has continually pushed the chair to lower rates substantially.  The question is going to be whether or not, A, he does this, but also if he has the legal grounds to do so. When we actually look at the Federal Reserve Act, of course, a Fed governor can only be removed for cause. It's unclear exactly, in terms of reading the law, what it actually means to try to fire a Fed chairman. Though, of course, as Fed chair, he is a Fed governor as well. And there's a question of to what extent.  this would be applicable to both of the titles that he holds. It also is a question of what exactly that cause would be, because simply not lowering interest rates isn't necessarily a justified cause, which is why we may have seen the administration putting continued focus on specifically the cost of the renovation to the Fed buildings here in Washington, suggesting that Powell may have lied to Congress about that.

This is a procedural hurdle.  to try to get them to be able to vote for final passage on various pieces of crypto legislation. Because yes, it is still crypto weak in the House.

As for what is the issue right now, we are trying to find that out.  Well, it's interesting. We spoke with Senator Tom Tillis of North Carolina on balance of power last night, Megan, about the idea that the House could try to change the Genius Act and send it back to the Senate. And he suggested that could be a deal breaker, that the House shouldn't do that. The problem is that the House doesn't do that. The House, once again, has gotten jammed by the Senate. This is just lawmakers in Congress, at least some of them, feeling like there's a repeated pattern here where they don't have the power, the authority. Yes. I think part of what we are seeing here, the undercurrent here, are these hardliners.  feeling like, as you said, that they are being jammed by the Senate, that they need to sort of take whatever the Senate ultimately passes.

Well, I don't think anything is a guarantee right now as we're seeing  play out on the House floor.

And people said that there was no way that we could ever do it.  And I continue to say failure is not an option. Of course, the crypto legislation that is on the floor is within other committees of jurisdiction from the House Ways and Means Committee. We're working on our own crypto items that's not on the floor.  But I truly believe that we'll be able to iron it out, get it together and pass it. We have always, whether it's funding government, whether it's the debt extension, people didn't think we could do it. It got a little rocky, but we still got it done. And it's going to happen the same here today."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 670.795, "text": " Chairman Smith, if we see passage today or even later this week of the Genius Act, do you anticipate that this will clear a path eventually for something on market structure?

That's what President Trump has said over and over again. We had a hearing this morning in the Ways and Means Committee on cryptocurrency and taxing digital assets. This is another point that has to be addressed and looked at. And that's what the Ways and Means Committee is focused on from this gambit within the digital asset space.  super important. As you know to the markets to investments there's 50 million 50 million Americans that that are involved with digital assets. So that's that's pretty substantial. And we need to make sure we continue to be the world leader.  Well, of course, markets and investments also care very much about tax policy, which is why we all paid such close attention to the tax changes and extensions that were included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, one piece of budget reconciliation. But, Mr. Chairman, the chair of the Budget Committee, Jody Arrington, told our colleagues this week that he wants to work on a second budget package to pass by the end of the year. I wonder if you  see that as likely given how hard it was to get the first line across the finish line and what if any tax changes you would want included in a second reconciliation package.  Well, let me just say there has never, there has never been two partisan reconciliation bills that have become law in the same year. It's never happened before. So trying to do a second one is doing something that when the Democrats controlled the White House, the House and the Senate, they attempted to do two and then ultimately couldn't pass Build Back Better. And then the next year they did a second reconciliation bill, but it wasn't in the same year.  So it is extremely difficult to do, because passing a budget reconciliation is not easy. As you saw, what we passed just recently, which is the largest tax cut in U.S. history, the largest spending cuts in U.S. history, the largest welfare reforms in U.S. history, the largest one-time investment in border security in U.S. history, that wasn't easy. And we had to pass it just in the House. The first initial vote was 215 to 214.  So it was by one vote. The Senate, J.D. Vance, had to do the tie-breaking vote. So it's very, very difficult. But if we come up with a reconciliation package that addresses needs for working families, small businesses and farmers, we'll get it done.

This is something that a lot of people's not paying attention to or discussing. If you look at the revenues that came within the federal government and the expenses we had, last month was the first time since June of 2016 that we had a month that created a surplus, not a deficit.  Of course, we need a surplus for 12 different months, but if you look into why did the month of June actually have a surplus and not a deficit spin, it's because of the increased tax revenues, but also the increased tariff revenues. Those are the two biggest issues that led to making sure that government was balanced for the month of June. So tariffs do play a part of the role.  I've said all along, when you're looking at the fiscal sanity, the fiscal responsibility of government, you have to look at three different legs. You have the tax issue. You need certainty in the tax code. We just finished that with the one big, beautiful bill.  Then you have the trade mechanisms, and then you have the deregulation. Once you do those three legs, that will create an economy that will go gangbusters, and it will help us balance our budgets. And these trade agreements that the president's working on, you're even having CEOs now of some major U.S. companies that's going out there saying, I was opposed to the president's tariff policies, but  They're really not making an impact. They're not inflationary. They're not raising prices. And I think they're working.  Well, Mr. Chairman, we know that President Trump is paying close attention to that lack of an inflationary read-through, at least at this time, from his tariff policy. And he sees that as further justification for his view that the Federal Reserve should be cutting interest rates right now. I'm sure you're aware of the reporting, which the president has pushed back on, that he was considering firing the chair of the Federal Reserve. Do you believe he would have the legal authority to do that? Is questions over the cost of the renovations to the Fed buildings here in Washington justification for firing for cause?  First off, I will tell you, I agree with the president that interest rates should be cut. Interest rates were raised because we went through an inflationary crisis during the Biden administration where inflation went up 22%. We now have the lowest inflation that we've had in four years, but yet they've not reduced one time the interest rates. So he has a valid point when you're talking about the interest perspective.  If you look at other heads of different agencies, whether it's the IRS, the IRS commissioner chose to step down whenever President Trump was elected so that President Trump could put in place his person. This is something that I would consider Mr. Powell to do. He should consider resigning because clearly he's not aligned with the President of the United States.  other people's done that with the agencies. I think Chairman Powell should should consider his place in government right now.  All right, Mr. Chairman, we appreciate you joining us. Congressman Jason Smith, the Republican representing Missouri, of course, and chair of the House Ways and Means Committee here with us on balance of power. Thank you so much.

So on that note, let's bring our political panel into the conversation. Bloomberg Politics contributors Rick Davis and Jeanne Shanzano are with us. Rick, of course, Stonecourt Capital Partner and Republican Strategist. Jeanne, Democratic Analyst and Senior Democracy Fellow at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress. Jeanne, I wonder how you read into the reasoning  president trump has around interest rates that mike was just referring to that actually at the end of the day what this really is about for him in large part he says is about the interest burden of the united states making sure those payments are lower is this the president that maybe is a bit more worried about our debt and deficit knowing that his one big beautiful bill just passed that will add to it  Yeah, I don't know of a president, Republican, Democrat, anywhere in between who has not wanted lower interest rates. So in this way, Donald Trump is perfectly in keeping with every, not just president probably, but every politician or most of them.  And sure, he is going to be concerned about the interest rates. He's going to be concerned about debt and deficit because this reflects on him. The number one reason he was elected, according to those exit polls in 2024, was that he promised to be able to manage the economy in a way that people felt Joe Biden simply wasn't doing, that he was a sound manager as a former businessman.  of the economy. And so as he sits here today, six, seven months in, he knows he owns this economy and interest rates are something that we all feel as consumers and voters. So it does matter. And we all, of course, see the ticking up of the deficit and that matters as well. So he's looking at the same numbers we are. Voters feel it. And so it matters to him."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 27, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1359.397, "text": " Rick, when it comes to numbers and what the president and his allies in Congress as well are looking at, how much are they factoring in the market reaction? It was quite negative when those reports began to emerge that the president had not only floated the idea of firing Jay Powell in private, but even waved around a letter. We've seen those numbers recover a little bit, but how much of this is a factor in their thinking?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 28, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1385.165, "text": " Yeah, I think quite different from his first term, where he seemed hypersensitive to market changes. He seems a little bit more immune to them in this term. Obviously, the biggest crisis he'd had in the markets was when he got into a bit of a trade war earlier in his administration and backed right off of that, yielding us a new acronym, TACO tariffs, and the TACO trade. And so I think he's thinking more long term on this.  You guys are absolutely correct that he's got the deficits in his rear view mirror, looking at those every day, realizing that these interest rates that keep ticking away are not very dynamic. They're very much a penalty to any administration that runs up the deficit. And that's exactly what he's just done with this big, beautiful bill. But the other key component to his entire budget strategy is economic growth.  And he needs these low interest rates for economic growth. So maybe less focused on the markets today and much more focused on new building development manufacturing starts things like that that really require lower economic lower interest rates in order to create that kind of economic growth which of course all his models that he argued  for in selling the big beautiful bill were three and a half, 4% GDP. He's a long way off of that. And so I think that's what's really fueling his interest here.  Well, but doesn't that just speak to the kind of catch 22 for the president, Rick, where he wants juice to grow or he wants growth to be juiced. So he wants interest rates lower, knowing growth might take a hit ultimately from his tariff policy, depending on the extent to which tariffs are actually implemented and for how long they stay in place. But it's those very tariffs that is keeping the Federal Reserve on the sidelines for now, not wanting to cut interest rates because of inflation. Can't we chalk up all of the difficulty he has around interest rates to his own policy, not necessarily the Fed's?  Yeah I think that this is a massive change. This is not a small change. And if you follow sort of the Mar-a-Lago accord in the in the significant alterations of the global economic infrastructure that exists today that this administration is pursuing there's a lot of friction.  And I think this is the kind of friction you're seeing happen right now on these issues. You know could he get the Fed to move more quickly if there weren't pressures on prices because of tariffs. Absolutely. But he needs those tariffs to generate revenue in order to reset the financial relationships. And of course one of the fundamental aspects of his realignment economically is getting down the trade deficits. And so you know he's not going to give that up. What he wants to do is get rid of Jerome Powell."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 29, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1555.197, "text": " Jeannie, it's been very hard to keep up with the fast-moving pace of everything that is happening here with Trump, from Jay Powell to tariffs.

Now, Mike, I always say Democrats and forming a cohesive sort of narrative to sell it an election. It's something like an oxymoron. It doesn't work so well all the time. But given the big, beautiful bill, they should be able to do that. And, you know, what's working against them are things like Mamdani's potential election in New York City.  But putting that aside, they are going to be arguing, number one, about health care and the impact of this big, beautiful bill on health care, the impact of inflation. We've seen that tick up, the impact of debt and deficits on their children, their grandchildren. But I think most important to make the case that Donald Trump is doing the bidding of the billionaires and  He's a very wealthy, and he is leaving aside the people he claims to care most about, the working and the middle class who bear the brunt of all of this, including, by the way, on his tariffs. I know his talk about tariffs is always they, meaning the other country, will pay 19% in the case of Indonesia. The fact is Americans at home will bear the brunt of that, and it is a regressive tax. So Democrats have to make that case.  All right, Jeanne Shanzano and Rick Davis, our political panel here on Balance of Power, both of them Bloomberg politics contributors. Thanks for being with us, as always, here on Bloomberg TV and radio. And we want to go live now here on Bloomberg to the North Lawn of the White House, where we find Bloomberg's chief political correspondent, Anne-Marie Hordern, having just been in the Oval Office with President Trump and having the chance to question him about his intentions with the chair of the Federal Reserve. So, Anne-Marie, obviously, some pushback to today's earlier reporting.  Yeah, a lot of pushback from the president in the Oval Office. He talked about the fact that he is not looking or planning to fire Jay Powell. When I asked him about this draft letter, did he write it? Did he wave it in front of congressional Republicans at this dinner last night? He said, no, there is no letter. He discussed the quote, concept.  of the idea of firing the Fed chair. He actually said that lawmakers most of them were really in favor of it. But he said he is more conservative than they are. So he pushed back on this notion. But he continued of course to bring up his gripes with Fed chair Jay Powell. One of course being the fact that  He thinks the Fed should be lowering interest rates and we have not seen the Fed do that of course since last year before the election. And now this new one that you've seen a lot of administrative officials really start to push going after the Fed chair for the renovations that are taking place at the Federal Reserve Building. So he kept those talking points but he made it pretty clear that at this moment he has no plans to fire the Fed chair which of course would open up a huge legal battle because this would be a president in American history."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 31, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1743.218, "text": " Amory, are you getting a sense that that whole question of the renovation of the Fed headquarters is emerging as a coherent means of arguing for and justifying the Fed chair's exit?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 32, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1756.752, "text": " Well, they definitely are looking into it. And even within the Fed, we do know that the Fed chair, Jay Powell, is asking questions about it. How did the renovations become over budget, et cetera?

But the president continues to go after what, for him, is the biggest problem.  which is where interest rates are right now, and he wants to see them lower. Of course, a lot of economists on Wall Street, even ones that are sympathetic to the president's view, like Neil Dutta of Renmec, who says the Fed should be lowering interest rates, said if you were to fire him, it'll have the exact effect in the market that the president's looking for.  Yeah, well, it all comes down to the behavior of the bond market, I guess, at the end of the day. Anne-Marie Hordern, live at the White House for us. Thank you so much for being here on Balance of Power, and we'll have more straight ahead. I'm Kayleigh Lyons, alongside Mike Shepard, right here on Bloomberg TV.  President Trump, again, as we've told you repeatedly this hour, has said he is not planning on firing the Fed chairman, but he still is unsatisfied with the chair's performance and with the current state of interest rates, which he wants to see lower in the face of what he said in the Oval Office today, Mike, is, quote, no inflation.  And at least looking at the PPI data that we got today, you could see how that technically might be true, at least in this particular instance, as both PPI on the headline and core exiting out food and energy month on month rose 0%."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 33, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1851.203, "text": "It would be a very favorable reading for the president and his point of view, but it's only one month.

What we saw was a drop in service industry inflation in the PPI that was strong enough, because it's a service industry economy, to push down the overall number, or to keep it flat rather, which on a year-over-year basis brought down the PPI inflation numbers. But the goods inflation went up, and we saw goods prices rise on a number of areas that are tariffed.  So for the Fed, they're going to be looking at this and saying there's evidence that tariffs are going to bleed through into the economy and they are going to cause prices to go up. I go back to what Mike just said about it's only one month. So the Fed's going to want to make sure that this is a continuing pattern and it could get worse before they do anything. So  Well even though this would make the case to somebody who didn't understand economics like perhaps the person in the Oval Office it's not going to make the case for the Fed. And so I suspect that the president is going to be disappointed at the July meeting even if the numbers suggest that inflation is somewhat tame."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1970.66, "text": " Now, the Fed chair has insisted that the law backs him up in staying in his role.

But even he knows that  That would cause problems for the overall Fed because in essence you'd have two Fed chairs. You'd have somebody the president appointed whom the markets may not want to listen to. And then you'd have Jay Powell whom the markets are used to listening to.

What this president has been very clear about is he doesn't like the interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve. He puts that fully on the chair of the Federal Reserve. So there are two things that can be true at once. One is that he doesn't like Powell's approach to rates being too late at the beginning of COVID and thinks that our rates should come down now.  And then the second part is to see that the second part is that the Open Markets Committee is dominated by Biden appointees. So even if you remove the Fed chair, you still have an Open Markets Committee that has a different view than the president does.  And you're talking about the Fed chair's term of office ending at the beginning of next year. So I think what we're seeing today is the president highlighting the fact that inflation has come way down, that the tariffs haven't had a dramatic negative impact on inflation, counter to expectations, and is trying to drive his economic message in light of what we know is the inflation print this morning.  So all these things are complicated and there's a lot going on here, but the key message the president's trying to drive is an economic one, not a personnel conversation.  Well, I'd like to ask you about a separate live conversation happening as we speak, Mr. Chairman, on Capitol Hill right now, as the House is moving toward reconsidering the rule that failed yesterday, a procedural hurdle to advance three different pieces of crypto legislation as part of crypto week. The rule that failed yesterday was because of a handful of lawmakers who actually convened with the president at the White House last night, a meeting which the president emerged from saying  we have a deal, they're now going to vote to pass the rule. And indeed, the chair of the Freedom Caucus, Andy Harris, confirmed that on X a few minutes ago, that they will be voting in favor of the rule today. When do we break out of this pattern of people voting no initially, President Trump stepping in, and they ultimately decide to change their minds? What's the point of the exercise?  That is the point of the exercise, which is I'm going to stop your agenda, President Trump. You're going to bring me to the Oval Office. I will say to you, I love you and I didn't want to hurt you. Give me assurances about some extraneous random thing.  And then they vote yes. So what they want is the attention and love of the sun, the moon, and the stars. And right now in the Republican ecosystem, that is in the person of Donald J. Trump, who controls this party. Unlike any other politician in modern American history, he has control over his party, and thereby the policymaking on Capitol Hill. So it is a messy way to do it.  It is very embarrassing for congressional leadership to have to send members over to the White House for the president to close them again. But that's the process that we're going through. And inevitably, what they've shown, what policymakers on Capitol Hill have shown, especially the Freedom Caucus, is that they will cave, they will fold, and they must do that in the room with the person of Donald Trump. But they will inevitably fold for no change in policy.  And that's what's happening once again with crypto that happened on reconciliation. It's happened probably a half dozen times so far this year. I will continue."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 45, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2433.171, "text": "Chairman Henry is your sense then that this actually gets through this week.

That's a smaller group, but they are well-versed in the set of policies that are in the Clarity Act or last Congress called FIT21.  That is the market structure bill that brings clarity to commodities and securities and defines a digital asset and a means of exchange. So House members are much further along on this than Senate members, and so the Senate is going to take a lot of time to actually understand this policy. The tradeoffs to go through this and then go through the stages of grief before they can get to actually voting on a market structure bill. Hopefully that happens this fall, but it should. It's going to take longer than expectations, unfortunately.  Well, Mr. Chairman, we just have a minute left. Is that effort in the Senate knowing it would require Democratic buy-in, potentially disrupted by a rescissions vote we could see later today or tomorrow that Democrats obviously don't want to see? Do you see that disrupting potentially the appropriations process and any further bipartisan effort on crypto or other things?  Yes, I think when Chuck Schumer got played by President Trump and Elon Musk in the Doge process, that kept the government open at the beginning of the year. I don't think Schumer and the Democratic Senate will play the same rules, by the same rules going into the fall. I think the likelihood of government shutdown is rather high, given the environment we're currently in, highly partisan environment we're currently in. And that will curtail a lot of serious policymaking that could otherwise be done.  All right, not an optimistic note to end on, but we'll leave it there, Mr. Chairman.

So they, because they're employed and because of wage growth, and that's not every single consumer, but in the large, in the main, they are continuing to grow and spend more, and that helps the economy. And so you're seeing in some of the moderate income households, there's a little bit of shuffling, moving around to different things. You're seeing people trade from one thing to another, less planes, more cruises earlier, that's leveling out now. A lot more going to movies because the movies are good.  But at the end of the day, they're spending discretionary and necessary at about the same percentage they traditionally spent. They've got money in their accounts, they're employed, and the wage growth has been relatively strong. And, you know, so they're in pretty good shape. The credit quality is good. They have equity in their homes.  of financing the mortgage, so conservatives are pretty good. When you go to small businesses, that's more the question, small, medium-sized businesses, because the interest rate environment hits them harder because they borrow on lines of credit short-term for a lot of their activities, and that rate went up substantially. And then you think about the, if I'm a $100 million company, a $50 million company here in North Carolina, and I'm engaging in a world  finance. I'm importing goods and manufacturing them, further manufacturing them, selling them. You know, it got pretty interesting here trying to figure out all the trade and tariffs.

The alternative would not have been good if their tax rates would have changed.

One is, you're absolutely right. In May of next year, the term of the current Fed chair ends after being reappointed. And it's the right of the elected president to appoint the next successor and go through Congress. And I think in that dialogue around that, there'll be a lot of dialogue about, OK, how do you set interest rates? What do you think about interest rates? Because the Fed is an independent agency. And they're meant to be outside the purview of the executive and the Congress. They are called to task, and they're monitored,  and they're reviewed and all the things. But the reality was it was set up to be independent so that our central bank in America was independent. So I think no matter who gets in, they're going to look at it and have to look at the facts and make a decision. Because if you drop rates too far, inflation may kick up and then you're going to have to raise them back quickly.  On the other hand, if you think the prior Fed has been slow to lower rates, you might lower them faster. Our team believes that the Fed will lower rates in the second half of next year by 100 basis points. No change until then because inflation is still going through the system. That brings the Fed funds rate down closer to three, which they think is probably more of a  a long-term rate, and frankly, is more similar to what we had for most of American history. What's been unusual is the period after the global financial crisis, a very low interest rate structure. That is really not a good place to be, honestly. We'd rather have a higher interest rate structure, a little more inflation, a little more robust economic growth.

AI just gives you a different attack surface, for lack of a better term. In the past, we had 300,000 people 15 years ago in our company. Today, we have 212,000 people. The company's bigger, complex, more transactions. From that time, our digital logins were probably 10, 20 million a quarter, and we felt good about it.

But that digitization was customers doing things on their own at 10 o'clock at night and 7 o'clock in the morning, and that allowed us to,  save our time for our people to go out and help customers solve difficult problems. What AI, the place that we think AI has real help is in the preparation of our relationship management force and our small business bankers, our business bankers, our commercial bankers, our wealth management, our investment bankers, allows them to be much more prepared. So we're using those tools  to prepare the information, pull it together, because it can take text and manipulate it and put it into the forms and the capabilities.

You've said that you're moving towards stablecoin, as some other banks are as well. You saw Mr. Bailey, who's the governor of the Bank of England, really said that might have systemic risks, because it takes some of the money out of the banking system. You're better off going a different direction. Are you worried about systemic risks from stablecoin?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 786.305, "text": " So one of the questions, and I think what Mr. Bailey was talking about, is a question I think the banking system, the United States, the policymakers have to think about, which is think about the money market mutual fund. About $6 trillion of deposit banks moved to money market mutual funds. And their utility was to invest in short-term deposits, treasury bonds, et cetera, commercial paper. They can't invest long-term. So their ability to help the economy is really a limited amount. That $6 trillion is outside the system.  If you said we're going to take the $18 trillion or whatever the bank says today, another $6 trillion out, you have to think through the policy ramifications because to keep it stable, you have to have it invest in a very narrow place. I think that's what Mr. Bailey was talking about. I think that dialogue is going on.  There's another side of this, which means those deposits will come back in the system if we hold the deposits effectively in escrow custody for our customers who are out engaging stable coins. So I think there's a lot of turns in the track between where we are today and where we might be on this. Our view is pretty simple.  10 years ago, you would have said, the clients don't need a thing called Zelle. And now they use it twice as much as they use checks. And it is used more times than the amount of checks written by our consumers, the amount of cash transactions taken cash, all the M's. So it's become the dominant payment network for consumers outside of card. That didn't exist 10 years ago. So we got to have the consumers adopt this. If they want it, we'll build it. And they'll use it. And if it's a way to transact,  will be there to help them transact. We think, you know, small bounce, cross-border transfers, in-app sort of patient purchases, all these types of things, applications for it. But at the end of the day, it's our customer who needs to say, I want to move money. I want to move money into euros. I want to move money into stablecoin.

There's a huge amount of pressure on weaker currencies, and they're trying to find how they're going to interact in between the U.S. and China. So that's the source of this. You know, the mistake, and we should remind people of this, was the world becoming dependent on China.  We're all aware of how harmed Germany was by depending on Russia for their natural gas.

I want to look at Goldman, ticker GS. So Charlie mentioned shares are down across the board for all these banks reporting today. Goldman shares down two tenths of one percent. So pairing some of those earlier losses, but  You would not expect that from a bank that just reported its best stock trading quarter in history. That's trading revenue of more than $4 billion, which is about $600 million more than what analysts are expecting. Fixed income revenue and investment banking fees  also healthily exceeding analyst estimates. But I was asking the markets life strategist just before I came on here, why the reaction, right? Very muted. And that is because Goldman shares seem to be essentially a victim of their own success. We did see those shares hit record highs earlier in July, a lot of expectations heading into the earnings season. And even though Goldman handily beat them, it really was a sense of price to perfection when it comes to the share price. So we're just seeing a little bit of a pullback here today.  Bank of America also lower this morning. They're down like four tens of percent, but they posted this record second quarter That's right. That's right Lisa. Yes a Bank of America ticker BAC shares also pulling back this morning interesting Oh because you know the equity trading revenue that was really the key to Goldman success is  was a little bit softer you know compared in comparison for Bank of America that did 2.1 billion dollars that's you know that's nothing to to sniff out but and it did top expectations but it is slightly softer from the previous quarter but net interest income rising 7.1 percent to more than 14 billion dollars also CEO Brian Moynihan commenting on the state of consumers saying that they are resilient their health they have healthy spending they have asset quality so  pretty upbeat assessment there of how households are doing."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 134.133, "text": "And as Charlie Pellett just reported, we have the CEO, Mr. Moynihan on Bloomberg Television with David Weston, 2.30 p.m. Wall Street time today about our good friends down in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Tariffs"], "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 146.101, "text": " Yeah, Johnson and Johnson ticker J and J.

And so it's interesting because we did have President Trump speaking a week earlier saying that he would impose tariffs of as high as 200% on drug companies if they don't start shifting their manufacturing toward the US in the next 18 months. But then according to CFO Joe Wolk, that's actually good news because that means it's a slow ramp up to tariffs and the 18 month runway is a recognition that it takes some time for companies to be able to do this, right?

It's a pretty high hurdle. Now, it should be said that hurdle is  potentially going to be lowered by the Supreme Court for other federal agencies. Trump has moved to fire some FCC commissioners, and the Supreme Court is hearing that case. And there's a lot of speculation that they will allow Trump to do that. But the court, very importantly, has already in a preliminary ruling  signaled that they are likely to treat the Fed differently, saying it has unique historical qualities as a public-private institution. Legal scholars have interpreted that as a sign that the Supreme Court will protect and keep this for-cause hurdle in place for Fed governance. So if Trump wants to remove Powell from the Fed altogether, he will have to show cause.  Now, historically, that's meant inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance, according to the legal experts.

And I think what we're finding is that CEOs are coming in a little bit bolder about what the second half looks like.

When tariffs were first introduced in early April, it was this huge change, and people didn't really understand even what the implications were for their supply chains. Over the last couple of months, many CEOs have been able to sharpen their pencils,  understand where those implications are, sometimes diversify their supply chain so that they're less beholden to, let's say, China, where that's sort of been ground zero for tariffs, and also be able to forecast different scenarios. So again, this doesn't say that policy isn't an impact. I think policy uncertainty is still a really big challenge, but being able to have that time to work through it really makes it much easier to be able to manage through.  Is the air getting very rare for some of these stocks? And John was asking for the totality of the morning saying, you know, not good enough, not good enough. And that seems to be the read through from bank stocks. Is that a sort of wider spread phenomenon throughout the stock market?  So when we came into earlier this year, one of the main risks that we saw were high valuations in a very concentrated market. With the rebound that we've had more recently, we still have those same exact risks. And so that's really a big reason why we're leaning a little bit more into mid-caps, a little bit more into non-US.  So yes, I think that's a challenge, but it's a challenge for certain names. And then you mentioned financials. I think that's a really interesting area where these names got some really nice lift recently. So I think some of the maybe like lackluster reaction to the earnings is more a reflection of what the stocks have done recently. And I think importantly, as we look through those bank earnings, what we see is pretty decent underlying economic growth. And I think again, that augers well for second half earnings growth in general.  You know, it feels very volatile. There's been a lot of volatility on a headline level. When you actually look at the move index, which is implied volatility and treasury yields, it's pretty low. When you take a look at the average VIX, it's come down pretty significantly. Do you just sort of sit on your hands, decide what you like, buy it, go on vacation?  I like to describe the first half of the year as the Van Winkle market, right?

The market has reacted less and less with every new tariff announcement because, and this is important, because the assumption is that the Trump administration is not going to accept a recession in exchange for its trade agenda. If that breaks,  then I think we have a very different market.

But it's been largely justified because of stronger growth in the U.S. I think as we're moving from a very unipolar free trade world to a multipolar world where maybe U.S. is a little bit less dominant, I think we start to see capital flows outside of the U.S. And then on top of that, you have maybe a little bit of a narrowing of the differential in growth rates, a little bit of a narrowing of that valuation difference."}, {"keywords": ["EU"], "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 300.035, "text": " What is the European growth story that I can get excited about?

The growth story is fewer holidays. That's what we're learning. For us.  For us, sure. Yeah, but in France, right? The idea that you're going to take two holidays out. I just wonder, you know, what this sort of debt management and sort of when debt is too much discussion, whether that's really going to come into play with bond vigilantes. It seemed to be picking on Germany, even though Germany's debt to GDP ratio is really good. It's not as though they're particularly overly indebted. And yet, you've seen yields in the long end climb there, too. I think if there's anybody who needs the finger pointed at that has a debt problem, it's the US.  And as I think about one of the largest challenges that the US faces, and a really intractable problem, is the amount of debt that we have. And let's be clear, it is Republicans and Democrats who have contributed to this. This is not a political issue, this is an American issue. We like to spend money, and so far the debt markets have given us a pass, right? For many, many years we had really, really low interest rates.

And now there is an easing again of these restrictions. We had a similar situation last year and the year before last. So I would say these back and forth, you shouldn't read too much into it. I think the reality is that  you have a situation with three major metrics. One is making sure we protect the US leadership in AI. The second one is making sure we don't completely cut off the relationship with China because, as Brandon mentioned, China has very important elements into the AI race, like the rare earth materials. And the third one is that, of course, the US government, the US administration is very careful  to protect the interests of US companies. And so this situation always creates a back and forth. It's good sometimes to tighten the rules to slow down the progress of China. But at the same time, doing too much of that favors China is developing their own supply chain.  And it's good to maintain the leadership of US companies globally. So it's good, as Jensen said, that they keep selling in China and you have the right balance to find over time.

And then also they're growing their asset management business, particularly in alternatives, and people don't appreciate how much assets they're raising. And so I felt like we had a differentiated call, and now we've become more consensus. So we're just looking for opportunities where we still have differentiated calls. But listen, you had a great quarter.  And I actually think the outlook, again, trading is going to be a little bit of a question mark in the back half of the year, because the tariff volatility did help. But Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, too, they're gaining market share. So you have the market backdrop, which volatility helps. Then on top of that, both firms are actually taking market share in trading. Goldman's really leaning in on the prime brokerage business. So we feel really good about the tone of the business.

But this world of kind of less regulation, I think, is starting to creep in. And I think it's going to be a tailwind for banks over the next couple of years.  And then on top of that, I think another catalyst here is consolidation. You're starting to see a little bit of bank mergers. It's going to be in the kind of the small, mid-sized banks.

And that adds to our list of number ones. We're also number one for education freedom and have been for many years. Number one for public higher education.  We have a 50 year low in the crime rate we have the lowest per capita debt of all 50 states and we've retired almost 50% of it now, just since I've been governor of the entire history of Florida we've knocked out 50% of it just in our tenure. We're also the lowest number of state government workers per capita.  Anywhere in the country and yet we're still dozing all this stuff even more to do even better And then if you look at what we're doing on illegal immigration We are far and away the number one state that is fighting for illegal immigrants to be deported Not even a close second  We're also the only state that actually returned money to the DOJ and the federal level for rejecting federal funds. I mean, we rejected things that Biden was trying to cram down our throat. Oh, you get money for roads, but then you've got to monitor everyone's tailpipe emissions or do DEI. Uh-uh, that ain't happening on my watch. And so we've rejected it, but Biden didn't even know how to take it back. We sent it back under the Trump administration. So on and on, we've led on so many different issues.  and that's part of the reason why people look to Florida for leadership. Now, we're here today because we had a vacancy in one of our statewide offices. So we have the governor, of course, who I think you guys all know who I am. We have Attorney General, Chief Financial Officer, Agriculture Commissioner, our Chief Financial Officer for after the 2022 election got reelected, Jimmy Petronas, he ran for Congress  in Florida Congressional District 1. He got elected to that position and then had to resign, of course, from CFO. I said that I would make a selection when the legislative session ended, which was scheduled to end in May 2nd, ended up going all the way to the wire. And so we were signing bills in the budget, you know, at the end of June, even in the beginning of July, some of the legislation. So I said, as soon as that's over, this will be kind of next to be able to fill appointments.  You know, when you do something like this, for me, when I look at this, I look at what have you done? Because don't tell me you're going to do all these great things if you've had an opportunity to do it and you've never stood up and fought when it counted. I want people that have conservative principles. I want people that are dedicated to the mission. But I also want people that run into the fire, that run towards  the battles. We've got a lot of people that when things get a little tough, they cut and run, or they kind of just sit on the sidelines, see how things go out, and will just offer nothing but platitudes even when they do enter the fray.  And then even worse, you do have Republicans that will run for office singing our music, then they get in and they betray the voters that elected them in the first place. That obviously is the worst of any possible situation. So chief financial officer is important because it's interesting. I got work with the legislature to get Doge authority for the state of Florida, the governor's office.  so we can doge audit local governments and expose, I think, a lot of bloat in these local governments. And then the question's that, why are you paying property taxes to fund this bloat? Why don't we give homeowners a relief? And so that's all underway. But, you know, the chief financial officer has the ability to audit any governmental entity that receives state funds, which is pretty much probably everyone in the state of Florida. And so that authority is there. You have an opportunity to do that.  You also have an opportunity when you're managing, of course, the checkbook and everything for the state, but also to continue, you know, the momentum to heal Florida's insurance market. And it's very difficult when you have six major hurricanes in seven years. But in the last two years, because of very difficult work, we now have 14 companies that are entering the market in Florida. It's the only way you're going to be able, you have competition.  California, they're all leaving. Other states are all leaving. It's a problem really nationwide, but particularly for us with the tropical. So you have an opportunity to really be a voice for consumers when it comes to these really important issues. So there's a lot that can be done, but certainly  We need to be have people in office that are going to continue the momentum that are going to build off the success. We don't want people that are going to try to undercut that success. We don't want people that don't have a record of getting in there and fighting for what's right, even when it's difficult. And so with that in mind, I'm pleased today to be able to announce that I am appointing the most conservative senator in the state of Florida.  someone that has a very clear record as a warrior for all the things that the voters that elected us want us to do to be our next chief financial officer, and that is Senator Blaise N'Golia.  Now it's interesting because if you look on his Twitter handle, it's not Blaze or Angolia or Senator, it's gov gone wild. And I'm like, what does that mean? And he told me that this was years ago. He was watching out of control spending at the local level. And he's like, well, why are we paying higher property taxes when you guys are spending like this? And so it was really to be an activist  to get new people in at the local level that would be friendly to taxpayers. And now as chief financial officer, this is really going to come full circle for him because he's going to have the authority to go in and audit all those local governments and really hold them accountable in addition to everything that we do. But I said that I care about record. And yes, he's got a great financial record, which is important. But I look even broader than that because I want to say, who's running towards these fights  and who's running and hiding. And on every single time we've had a flashpoint in Florida, Blaze is running into battle to stand up for people like you. Look at illegal immigration. Nobody in the Florida legislature has done more to crack down on illegal immigration than Senator Blaze Angolia. He was the author of our E-Verify legislation. He was instrumental in enacting the  illegal alien transport program, which even visited places as far away as Martha's Vineyard. He led the effort to stop localities from being able to issue IDs to illegal aliens. We don't do driver's license at the state of Florida, but some of these locals wanted to do it. He put the kibosh on that. Also, a crackdown on establishments like hotels and motels that facilitate human trafficking, which is very much intertwined with  illegal immigration, also increased penalties for child predators, which also has connection for illegal immigration. But then earlier this year, I called a special session of the Florida Legislature because with President Trump about to take office, I knew this was our one final chance to be able to end the problem of illegal immigration once and for all. And yes, it starts with with sealing the border, which President's done a great job of.  But then you have all these millions and millions of people that Biden led in, and then many millions even over the years before that. There was no way that you were going to be able to conduct the largest removal operations in American history successfully unless the states and the local law enforcement were working hand in hand with DHS and the Trump administration to do this.  And so I asked for a number of policies, most significantly requiring that all state and local law enforcement agencies participate in these deportation operations and holding illegal aliens accountable.  And blaze was was standing there right beside me obviously the voters that elected us that's exactly what they wanted to see. But we had a movement in the Florida legislature led by the Speaker of the House to sabotage.  what we were trying to do. And they even passed legislation that I vetoed that would have made all the operations we have done this year in conjunction with DHS illegal in Florida. Alligator Alcatraz under their bill would have been illegal in the state of Florida. It was one of the worst pieces of amnesty legislation I have ever seen and one of the worst pieces of legislation we have ever seen Republicans put forward in the state of Florida. I vetoed it.  I had a handful of guys that stood with me for that. All the people were standing with me, but these politicians had the different agenda. Blaze was standing strong against that amnesty legislation. And if you didn't have people like Blaze standing strong against that, you would not have Florida leading the charge in that. And in fact, we would have ended up being a de facto sanctuary state.  So Blaze was right. A lot of these other guys, starting with the Speaker of the House, were wrong. And nobody should ever forget what they tried to do to you. That was stabbing you in the back with that legislation. And there was no question Blaze was not going to be cowed by that. And so I really appreciated him standing for that. He's also been the leader in the Florida legislature on election integrity measures. So you look at Florida has probably the best run elections anywhere in the country.  And we've done a series of reforms the entire time I've been governor. We try to build off the success to be able to make it that way and to be transparent and to be efficient. So all the things that we've done. I came in immediately. We removed the Palm Beach supervisor of elections, Broward supervisor of elections. We made it clear that we had a new sheriff in town, but we needed legislation  to be able to bring this all to a head. So if you look at things like banning ballot harvesting, if you look at the things like banning Zuckerbucks, all the major reforms that we were really leading the way on, Blaze was all leading those efforts every step of the way. You also look at his record on conservative issues, like the Second Amendment. He's got 100% record on Second Amendment issues. Never voted to violate your Second Amendment rights.  He's worked hard to break down outdated licensing barriers for people with reforming. It was a major landmark reform we did on occupational licensing. He's also been the leader in the Florida legislature on supporting term limits for county commissioners and school board members, and is also a big supporter of what I'm supporting nationwide in Article 5 amendments to do both a balanced budget amendment for Congress and term limits.  for members of Congress, which is really important. When we saw the woke mind virus flare up around the country, a few years back, it led to skirmishes in Florida where we had to pass  Parental Rights and Education Act to say, yeah, you know what, as a parent, you can send your kids to school in Florida, and they're not going to be taught that their gender is just a choice and they can change genders. That's not happening in Florida. We did things that the parents really appreciated. Not everyone appreciated that. Media, other things, and we even had a little company in Central Florida that didn't appreciate  that and we had to make a stand there and a lot of people said we were wrong on doing that but we were absolutely right to sign parental rights but then we were also right to ensure you know that we didn't have one company in Central Florida being able to also control its own local government and so Blaze was instrumental in us calling back that authority. We now have this run by state board oversight board.  And guess what they've done? They've cut taxes for all the local businesses. More local businesses are able to compete for projects. It's been a total home run. People said that Disney was going to leave Florida as a result of that. I think actually they're going to invest many billions of dollars more in Florida. But there are a lot of people that just kind of, they didn't necessarily want to be heard on that. Blaze was with us every step of the way. You also look this past November, we had, uh,  Special interests poured two hundred seventy five million dollars to amend Florida's Constitution with amendments three and four Both would have been very bad for this state We were up against a lot blaze was a hundred percent On board to defeat both of those amendments and we fortunately were able to defeat both of those amendments  So I think as CFO, he's going to be a really important voice for what a lot of Floridians are asking for, and that's relief from property taxes. And we're looking at this very, very closely because, you know, obviously you have to make the numbers work.  And I think we're going to be able to produce a proposal that's going to be very, very bold, but we're going to be out there soliciting input from people. But the reality is the free state of Florida needs to mean they're not going to tax your income, but it should also mean that you actually own your own property and you're not perpetually paying rent to the government. And that's the vision that Blaze shares with me. And I know that's a vision that a lot of people in Florida want to see realized.  And so that's not something we can just do by executive action, even by legislative enactment in the legislature. It's something that will require Florida voters to approve on the ballot in November of 2026. And so he's going to be instrumental in that. We also, a lot of people may not know that the chief financial officer serves as the state's chief fire marshal. Blaze was very supportive of my initiative to increase the pay of all the state firefighters.  We wanted 25%. The House under the Speaker wanted zero. The Senate helped us get to 15%, and that's what we ended up getting. And we're going to come back for more next year. But I think that as he leads the state component of our firefighter corps in Florida, they're going to know they have someone that has a demonstrated record of fighting for them and fighting for their interests. So I'm glad to be able to make this appointment.  To me, the record speaks of everything, and if you want to know what someone's going to do when they get into a position, look what they've done when they've had opportunities to lead. Did you lead, did you cower, or did you actually stab us in the back? There's really only three ways you can go, and I'm pleased to say that  We have our warrior senator stood with us every step of the way and stood with the people of Florida every step of the way on all these very, very important issues. And so without further ado, the state of Florida's next chief financial officer, Senator Blaze Angolia."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 980.333, "text": " Thank you, everyone. It is an honor to be here. And first, I want to thank my friends, my family, my wife, my daughter, my dad, my sister are here. This really means a lot. And for the people who know me, you guys know I care deeply about these issues. And I work night and day to make sure that I am a good public servant for you.  And I personally want to thank probably the greatest governor we may ever seen in any lifetime, Governor Ron DeSantis. So a couple of years ago, I had a conversation with the governor. I said, think about running for a higher office. And he immediately said, CFO, right? Because he knows.  The governor knows how much I care about spending. He knows how much I care about spending less and having better outcomes. And sometimes that is just what the opposite of what government does. But that's never stopped me. I've had a history of calling out wasteful spending, whether it was Democrats or Republicans, because I truly believe that government is accountable to the people.  And our job is to make sure that we deliver that promise. There are some things that I'm going to work on as your next CFO, and I'm going to work day and night to ensure that this happens. I had said, even though we weren't able to enable any property tax reform this past legislative session,  I've said publicly that I am not going away. I am going to continue to work hard to offer property tax reform. I am going to work hand and glove, side by side, with this governor to make sure that we get rid of property taxes on homestead exemption and offer real property tax relief to the people of the state of Florida. That, I will continue doing.  Part of that also is making sure that we are cutting back, cutting away and eliminating wasteful spending at the local level.  I don't need to tell you, you guys see it, that local governments, cities, county, spend things that should probably not be spent on. But with the audit authority at the CFO's office, I promise you we are going to start digging in and we are going to start calling out some of this wasteful spending. We are going to be a proactive office. People call me a conservative pit bull in the Senate. I'm going to be the conservative pit bull when it comes to spending.  as your next CFO. That I will promise you. First responders. I have always stood up for our first responders. I've always been there with law enforcement, working with the governor to make sure that we're bringing bonuses and we are recruiting the best from other states that want to escape high tax, high regulatory states and relocate to the state of Florida.  Being state fire marshal is an opportunity for me that is near and dear to my heart. I know that there are firefighters in the room and I thank you guys for our service.  The firefighters probably already know this, but I carried the bill that got them presumption cancer coverage to make sure that we take care of our firefighters, because fires of the past are not like fires of today.  If a structure was burned, it was usually concrete and wood. Now, they're plastic. And when these toxins enter the air, it's unfortunate, and we thank them for their service, but a lot of them are getting lung cancer.  for serving us. I will always stand with the firefighters. I'm going to continue to work hard as the state fire marshal to make sure that we help them out. Um, if they become injured on a job with that, I was also instrumental in passing  the PTSD bill because our cops, our sheriff's deputies, our first responders, unfortunately do suffer PTSD. And we have a higher than unusual rate of suicide amongst our first responders. It is a plague that needs to be solved. And you have my commitment that I will continue working on these issues. The governor already spoke on positive reforms when it comes to insurance.  I will continue to work hard on insurance. In fact, I'm going to work on housing affordability overall. Because when you have a house in the state of Florida, anywhere, you're usually paying principal interest taxes and insurance.  The taxes and insurance is something that we can help out with. Insurance was starting to run away, and the costs were just getting astronomical. But we put reforms in, and now we, the state of Florida, is leading the nation in bending the cost curve and making sure that we are getting the waste, fraud, and abuse out of the insurance industry. But I want insurance companies to listen to me. What I'm going to say next, especially for the cameras,  If an insurance company does not do what they say they are going to do and contractually obligated to do, I am going to call you out. I am going to make sure that people know that the CFO will stand with people against unscrupulous insurance companies who are not doing what they are supposed to be doing.  But with that, we are going to create the environment, continue creating the environment where we have a vibrant insurance market that will continue to push down rates. Look, it is unfortunate. A lot of the premiums, not the rates, the premiums for insurance companies have increased over the years, especially over the last five years.  And the main reason for that were two things. One is that fraudulent insurance company claims were driving up costs, but also insurance premiums are based upon the replacement cost of your house. So if your house five years ago was worth $200,000 and now it's worth $400,000, your insurance premiums are going to go up.  So just know that I'm going to be watching the insurance market, and I'm going to be helping out, including that, I'm going to be helping out the insurance agents to make sure that you guys as policy holders are getting the maximum amount out of your policies, and we're doing what we're supposed to be doing. I'm going to be a proactive fiscal watchdog for the state of Florida. One of my big concerns  is turning New York, turning Florida into New York. Do not New York our Florida. The difference under the leadership of Governor Ron DeSantis and what we are doing compared to California and New York is astronomical.  New York, we have more residents than New York right now. Their budget is more than twice what ours are. That is fiscal insanity. We stand for fiscal sanity. I'm going to make sure that this place does not turn into the place where so many people are fleeing from.  New York, New Jersey, not on my watch. I'm going to make sure that we are fiscally sane. I'm going to look to protect consumers against fraud. I'm going to work with the insurance agents to make sure that we are calling out the fraud. And I will tell you this, no one will work harder than I will to make sure that they deliver on these promises.  Every single campaign promise I have ever said on the campaign trail over the last 10 years, I've delivered on. If I tell you I'm going to do it, I'm going to get it done. Governor, thank you for entrusting me with this. We'll do great things."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1508.305, "text": "Well, well done.  I mean, from a fiscal perspective, not only do we have some more people than New York, we've got 4 million more people than New York. They have 19.5 million. We have 23.5 million. And yet, how is their budget more than twice our budget? Are their roads better? No. Are their services better? No. And obviously, are our educations doing better?  So, where is that money going? Those are choices that are being made. New York City's budget all by itself is more than the entire state of Florida's budget. And the budget I sign after my line item vetoes, we're spending less in fiscal year 25-26 than we did in  fiscal year 2425 and we spent less in fiscal year 2425 than we did in the previous fiscal year and so how many other states are actually reducing spending and yeah some of that was you know there was money sent down for COVID and all that that that was kind of one-time things but I think it shows a real commitment to fiscal responsibility and we've paid down now with this budget we'll have paid down almost 50% of  of Florida's total debt. We're obviously going to come back for more and do that in the ensuing years as well. But I don't know that there's that many states that are actually paying down and reducing debt. Your share of debt as a Florida resident, I think it's like 400 bucks. Your share of national debt as an American is like $106,000. And so, and escalating ours is declining. So there's a big difference in terms of how we've approached it for, how these other states have approached it.  I do think that as much as I mean I say I'm not asking anyone to move here because we've got a lot of people and you got to build roads and like honestly I'm I'm I'm fine if we just kind of like chill for a while. But the reality is if they elect this guy mayor of New York you are going to see people flee the coop. I mean it just  I mean, from just the cops, would you want to be a police officer when this guy thinks your agency shouldn't even exist? When he's going to blame the cops anytime anything goes wrong? I wouldn't want to do that. And so you come down to Florida, you get a $5,000 bonus. Do you have any openings in Hernando? Are you pretty full? OK. All right. Well, some place.  Yeah. Some places have some openings. I know some PDs and some other, but yeah, the reality is you're just going to see that. Um, and so as much as I am not like saying, you know, move here, whatever, because I do think, you know, housing's gone up everywhere over since COVID, but Florida, you know, you did have a lot intense demand. So people are buying these homes because they desperately wanted to be here. So when you have a little bit of a break from that, I think it gives some people some chance to, to get their sea legs. But the reality is in a free country, people vote with their feet.  And people are going to make those decisions. And every time they do dumb things in these other parts of the country, people tend to look to Florida to be the refuge. And so I'm happy to do this. I think Blaze is going to do a lot of good stuff on particularly the auditing of local governments.  And we have authority, we've got a team in governor's office, but we're gonna be working hand in hand to make sure. Local government's not easy, and we've got some people that do a great job, but we've also got some that have a lot of problems, a lot of problems. And I definitely have a few in mind that I know need a little bit of examination, let's just say that. So, okay, I see Forrest from Tallahassee. What do you got?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1713.957, "text": " With no disrespect to our new CFO, I'm curious why you didn't tap Senator Joe Gruders who has Trump's endorsement."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1725.396, "text": "Like I said in my comments, I go by your record. Political campaigning, political stuff to me is not as important about what's your record in office. And if you look at somebody like Joe Gruders, he's voted to violate Floridian Second Amendment rights.  Blazes stood in favor of Second Amendment rights. We did landmark legislation to hold teacher unions accountable for their partisan activism. It was a huge achievement for Republicans. Joe Grutter sided with the teacher unions rather than side with conservatives. On immigration, he was the author and architect  of this terrible amnesty bill, which would have made everything I've done, including Alligator Alcatraz, to help President Trump's illegal immigration removal agenda illegal in the state of Florida. Even protecting our coast with the boats from the Haitians coming in. We wouldn't have been able to do that. He also authored legislation that would have put gender ideology as a special class in Florida law. We've done the opposite.  since I've been governor. And then when we had the fight over amendment three, uh, Joe Grutter sided with the mega weed company true leaf and was joining with liberal Democrats to try to do it. So his record is contrary to what we've told the voters that we would do. And it's all about doing what you said you were going to do. Delivering blaze has done what the voters that have elected all of us expect.  Joe Gruders has taken major positions that are totally contrary from what our voter base wants to do. So when it comes to making an appointment, I have to go on the record. And I can tell you, if Blaise supported the Perez-Gruders amnesty bill, he would not be standing on this stage today. That's just the truth. And I like him personally, but it doesn't matter. It's all about the record.  So if George Washington rose from the dead and came back and tapped me on the shoulder and said, will you appoint Joe Grutter CFO? My response would be, no, I can't do that without betraying the voters that elected me to lead the state in a conservative direction."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1858.924, "text": "Are you prepared for a rift with the White House over this particular appointment?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1862.048, "text": "I don't think so. I mean, we were with the president the other day. I mean, he said we've got a great relationship. He's never once mentioned this to me. And all the times I've spoken with him  over these months, and so I don't know how high it is on his radar. I know there are political operatives that stand to gain by certain things. I get that. But in terms of him, it's never been anything we've discussed. Is it fair to say that you'll be campaigning, such as you are right now, for a place throughout the next year and a half? Well, I think the main thing we're going to do is do the people's business, right? Like, there's no need to campaign for a year and a half. I mean, honestly, it's like, are you focusing on that, or are you focusing on substance?  And so he's going to come in, I think with a head of steam, and you're going to see him doing things in office, not promising, not doing platitudes, but actually doing the job in office. That, to me, is what it's all about.  I think whether you're campaigning here or campaigning there, so he'll be a good partner with us, and I think he's going to produce really big results. And when you're doing that, then all the campaigning takes care of itself. When you're running and you have a record that you can run on,  then you don't have to worry about this or that. I mean, when I was running in 22, you know, I wouldn't even, really, I didn't campaign that much the last couple months because I had to deal with the hurricane, Ian. And we were off the trail for like three or four weeks. And you know what? It didn't matter because people knew that I had delivered time and time again. And that's really what it's all about, is delivering an office. As I said, if you have a record of fighting,  If you have a record of delivering, then I have confidence that you have an ability to do that going forward. If you don't have that record, if you're not running into the battles, if you're not taking on the tough issues, if you're not willing to make tough decisions when it's not easy,  well then you're not all of a sudden going to grow some backbone, right? It doesn't work that way. You know, if he wants a linguine spine, always a linguine spine. That's kind of how it is. So you've got to be somebody that is going to be fighting. And I think he's proven that he can fight and win. And a lot of the success that we've had in Florida is a result of having really good folks fighting for these things in the Florida legislature."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1996.613, "text": " My name's Nadine. I cover insurance only here in Tampa. As you know, insurance is number one priority for voters. And I know we're waiting for the market to stabilize. For those who feel the state still isn't doing enough, they're not seeing those rate decreases reflected in their premiums, as you mentioned, they're different. What would you say to our voters?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 2016.155, "text": " I would say, first I would rebut the claim that insurance rates have not taken a turn downward. So we have to distinguish between premiums and rates. As I've said before, premiums are going to go up as property values go up because it's based upon replacement costs.  So, when you hear some people on TV, quite frankly, getting hyperbolic, saying my premiums have increased, go after the Republicans, they're going up because their properties increased. Now, let's talk about the rates. The rates are what the insurance companies set. That is a percentage of the  actual replacement costs. When it comes to the rates, what we've seen and what the data is showing, that the reforms that we put in a couple of years ago is actually bending the cost curve down. We are seeing rates drop in auto insurance, and we're also seeing it drop in property taxes also.  I think the last bit of data that I had seen said that 49 states had double digit increases in the rates for insurance over the last 12 months. And Florida's was, I think it was less than 1%. But having said that, we continue doing what we need to do. We cannot undo the reforms that we put in place because then you're adding costs  to the cost structure. And this is what I don't understand. Insurance companies are no different than any other business. It's a P&L and it's a balance sheet, profit and loss. So when you add frivolous lawsuits, which is what we've seen. Now, not all lawsuits are frivolous. In fact, a lot of the lawsuits that are filed  done because insurance companies weren't doing what they were supposed to do and I've already made the promise that I'm going to hold them accountable and I'm gonna call them out but we cannot go back to the days of past where we're adding all that cost to the structure and expand and expect rates to go down it's the math does not math when you do that so in 24 Florida had the lowest rate increases in the country of all 50 states now obviously"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2148.995, "text": " You know, we've had six major hurricanes in seven years. That is a factor that these other states just don't have to deal with. But you had a report the other day, massive increases in some of these states in the middle of the country, huge issues with insurance nationwide.  I haven't seen Congress offer any type of relief. What was done in Florida was to relieve the excessive costs where Florida represented 78% of all litigation costs nationwide on property insurance. Well, that is not going to be sustainable. And so since that was done, you've had a stability. Now, it doesn't mean that all of a sudden people are having massive decreases, you know, which is what people want, but there's stability.  So what are the reforms that people propose that would make a positive difference? I know Blaze has always been open to that in the Senate. I'm obviously open to that in the governor. What did they try to do this year in the Florida House of Representatives? Did they try to do anything that would have reduced rates? No. They tried to do a bill that would have enriched plaintiff's lawyers and would have caused rates to spike. Every analyst that looked at that  said it would have caused rates to spike, it would have undone the progress to get to a place where we were attracting businesses and attracting companies. And that was done, proposed by Republican leadership in the Florida House of Representatives. So when I hear people out there, these politicians, when they're talking about the insurance, they either don't provide any positive reform that would make a difference, which I think I'm open to,  What they're trying to do is basically run interference for trial lawyers because the reality is the more litigation you bring,  If you're getting attorney's fees and the other isn't, then you have an incentive to do. And that's what was in Florida. Very few other states had that. We obviously had a cottage industry that has developed on all these different things. I mean, they did the roofer scam, they did this, they did that. That causes people to go. But the one thing that got traction in the Florida legislature would have caused your insurance rates to spike. Everyone that looked at that acknowledged that that was the case.  Part of what I think you gotta do is to prevent that from happening and to make sure that we continue to be a place where people have confidence. I mean, you think about it, you've had 14 new companies come in since these reforms were done. This stuff doesn't happen overnight, but people two years ago were thinking Florida wouldn't have any insurance offered. Like California, they're leaving. We've got millions and millions, and we've actually added private policies by the 100, 200,000 over the last couple years.  So that defied what most people were saying when you have six major hurricanes in seven years. So any positive reforms, bring them forward. But I can tell you that the number one thing that will help in this is not anything the legislature can do, it's mother nature. If we have a 10 year period like we did last decade, where we don't have any major events, if we have one of those runs, you're gonna see things improve very quickly. If we're constantly getting hit with majors,  You know, that just makes it more difficult. And I think if you look at how the market responded to two majors last year, you haven't seen big, stiff increases. You've seen basically stability, which I think a lot of people didn't think was done. But I think when people prattle about this, ask them what they want to do about it. Ask them for specifics.  about what they want to do. It's the most complicated homeowners insurance market in the country, maybe in the world. To ask them what they're going to do, because what I hear is people do platitudes, and then they come up with a trial lawyer subsidy bill that's going to cause you to pay more. Oh, we're holding the companies accountable by  by underwriting more lawsuits. Well, that has not worked. I mean, that was tried. It didn't work. So what are they going to do? Make them tell you what they're going to do. Don't let them just prattle off and say they're going to do it. Because I can tell you, no state's been better managed in terms of our budget and all that than Florida, you know, that we have under the last six years. And that stuff's not easy, but some of these issues are very, very  They're not easy fixes, and so be very weary of politicians that prattle that all of a sudden they're going to come in and be this great solution for it. The reality is this. Most of these politicians, when they do things, it makes your life worse, not better, okay? You'd rather them just sit on their hands because their solutions end up just making the problem worse.  So I had mentioned this the other day when I was in Northeast Florida. We sent out the request, the RFP, for Blanding. I think that there are a number of people that submitted bids. What I've told the DEM is I'm willing to do Blanding once Alligator Alcatraz is filled. And so the DHS has started moving in a significant number of people. I think you're gonna, and they're starting to deport people from there too.  This is not the Ritz-Carlton, okay? We're not doing this just to let people have food and shelter, although they do get that, but that's not, and all the minimum standards are upheld, but the reality is it's there to be a quick processing center so that they can, we have a runway right there, they can just be flown back to their home country. So that is the purpose of why we're doing it, and as that fills,  Once there's a demand, then we would be able to go for Camp Blanding. But what I don't want to do is set up Blanding if, you know, one is 60% full and then the other is 40%. I'd rather just have channel everyone to Alligator since it's easier. You can add from whatever, you know, you need. But we definitely think that you can do  easily 3 to 4,000 at Alligator Alcatraz. We have not yet received that many illegal aliens yet there, but it has grown pretty quickly. And if you think about it, we submitted our proposals, just kind of a broad policy about what we can do with the Florida Division of Emergency Management in the spring. We work with DHS and then finally they said, yep, if you do that, you know, that will be eligible for reimbursement. And so within a week,  we had this facility set up. And I know other states are now saying they want to get in the ballgame. It'll be interesting to see, you know, how quickly these other states are able to move. I think Florida's really set the standard, not only for executing missions, but doing it swiftly and doing it in ways that kind of defy people's expectations about what government can do. You think about  with the Iran conflict in Israel. We had a lot of, we had students over there. We had a lot of Floridians over there. All of a sudden they shut down Ben-Gurion Airport. You got all these rockets raining down. We turned the switch and we executed rescue missions and we brought back, I mean, we got, I think we got like 1,500 people out of Israel on boat. We fly people to Florida. We did all this stuff in record time and we were the only state in the game on that.  I'm not saying that every state has the same connections that Florida does in terms of our population and people that go over there or study over there. So I'm not saying every state should have done exactly what we did, but we were the ones in the game and we were able to bring a lot of people back home to safety. So that's just what we do. Blanding can be turned on very quickly.  I know they'll award the bids once we make that decision, but I don't want to set up a new infrastructure until, and look, this may happen in a matter of a week or two, right? I mean, it's possible. We also have different ways we can do blanding. We can use existing infrastructure there, which would not give us as big of a footprint, so we would end up having, you know, some illegals, but we wouldn't be able to house like 2,000 or 3,000 if the existing footprint, if we build out from there,  with the temporary structures, that's when you can get to 2,000 or 3,000. So we'll make those decisions based on the facts on the ground. But I told these guys, even though we're getting reimbursed for it, I was like, I don't want to be creating some structure that can hold 2,000 illegal aliens, and then we end up having like 150 there after a week. And I don't think that's the trend. I do think DHS is doing a good job of sending, and here's the thing.  These are basically like military-age males that are going to Alligator Alcatraz. I mean, like, you know, these are folks, and a lot of them have criminal records, but that's what's happening here, and I think it's been very effective. Now, I would note, kind of like,  You know, the Democratic Party in this state, such that it still exists in this state, they really, I mean, honestly, like, if I had to say, like, what I, as a Republican governor, would want you guys to focus on that would benefit us, I would tell them try to kick up a storm about Alligator Alcatraz. Because what it, first of all, what they're doing is incredible, and people that have been there and seen, it is, it's a professionally run operation.  But these are people that are illegally in the country. Many of them do have criminal records. Have you ever seen these Democrats in Florida fight this hard for you as an American citizen? I haven't seen that. In fact, they've opposed almost everything that we've done over these many years. And yet they're fighting tooth and nail to not have illegal aliens deported to their home country. Now, can you imagine, as an American,  You know, if you tried to, like, illegally enter France or Japan or China, I mean, you'd be sent back. Like, it wouldn't even be a question that that would happen. You want to try to work illegally in some of those countries? No way. They would not let you. So this is just basic upholding the rule of law. I do think it'll be beneficial if you're able to have an increased pace of removals.  you're gonna end up with less stress on schools, less stress on hospitals, less stress on the criminal justice system. I think higher wages for American workers, particularly in some of the industries that you constantly hear. So this is something that can be very beneficial for Floridians, and yet they want to basically put the thumb on the scale  for folks here illegally to just stay in the state of Florida and stay here indefinitely. That's what they want. So I don't understand why they think this is something that is gonna be effective. There's so many things that Floridians care about. Why don't you fight for Florida citizens? Why are you fighting for foreign nationals that came into the country illegally? It just doesn't make sense to me. One thing I do wanna mention, we were at,  out in Hendry County. This is further south than the Tampa Bay area, but we launched a major Everglades restoration, and it's the largest restoration in all of America, maybe in the world. There's a lot of different components to it, but one of the things that we've had to do is construct reservoirs on each side of Lake Okeechobee.  Army Corps, when that lake goes, they spew the water out into the rivers, it creates problems. And so we've worked with the Corps to mitigate that, but ultimately they can make those decisions. So we wanted to have the existing infrastructure where you could store water, clean it, and everything, everyone lives happily ever after. So yesterday, we opened the C-43 reservoir, which is on the east side of Lake Okeechobee. And that is gonna hold, I mean, they said we did the ribbon cutting, and South Florida Water Management District  said you could fit almost every Florida University inside the footprint of this reservoir. I mean like it's just a massive reservoir. So that's going to be something that's going to be very good. And basically what we've tried to do is just restore the natural hydrology to the state of Florida.  which means water moving further south through the Everglades into Florida Bay, and there's just a lot that goes into that. So that was a huge achievement. We also did the C-44, and the federal government has had to work with us. We've got to get them in a better spot, but we did the C-44, which is on the east side of Lake Okeechobee. Now we have this massive reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee, and we did our part in that ahead of schedule. The feds, Army Corps, are kind of doing what they're doing, but, you know, working with the president,  We have a, I think an agreement that we're likely to arrive at where we're going to get delegated the federal responsibility for a lot of those projects. And so we'll be able to get in, get some of those done. And so under Biden, this really slid to where this wasn't going to be done till the middle of next decade. And we want it done this decade. So I think now that's going to compress the timeline. So stay tuned on that, but we've been working really, really hard. And the president himself said,  We want to empower Florida, and even the Army Corps has acknowledged, look, Florida does things quick. We get it, and we want to utilize you. So, if we're able to get that agreement and then really work going forward, that will be one of the biggest achievements that any state government has ever had, because that restoration was floundering.  when I became governor, we were way behind on what we needed to do. And we really put a lot of emphasis and a lot of resources into doing something that'll have impacts in Florida for decades and decades to come. Okay, guys, thank you.

I thank our nominees for being here. Thank you for your willingness to put away a life which is normal to come serve the country in a time which sometimes never seems normal. The committee will hear from Crystal Carey, nominated for the General Counsel at the National Labor Relations Board. It confirmed Ms. Carey is committed to addressing the backlog of cases left by the previous administration, refocusing the General Counsel's Office to issue guidance giving workers, business, and unions clarity on how to comply with the law.  Ms. Carey's extensive experience at NLRB, including as a former field agent and an official at the Office of Appeals, is her great qualification. The committee is also considering Brittany Panuccio, nominated to be a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  If confirmed, Ms. Panuccio will work to ensure EEOC provides clear guidance encouraging compliance and leading to a better environment for workers. Her strong record as a prosecutor will help the EEOC continue robust enforcement efforts under this administration.  Lastly, the committee will consider Dr. Brian Christine to be an Assistant Secretary of Health at the Department of Health and Human Services. If confirmed, Dr. Christine will play a crucial role in modernizing HHS, making it more open, collaborative, and responsive to the American people. His experience as a practicing physician is an asset to the Trump administration as it works to make America healthy. Thanks again to all of our nominees for appearing before the committee. With that, Senator Sanders.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank the nominees for being with us today. I am strongly opposed to the three nominees that we will be considering this morning. Let me begin with the nomination of Crystal Carey to be the General Counsel of the NLRB.  Let us be clear, this nomination would be unnecessary if President Trump had not fired the most pro-union general counsel in the modern history of the National Labor Relations Board on January 27th. Moreover, the NLRB would have a quorum today if President Trump had not illegally removed a member of this independent board, Gwen Wilcox, on that same exact day.  The mission of the NLRB is to, quote, vigorously advance the policies of the National Labor Relations Act to promote collective bargaining by ensuring that workers can freely express their wishes regarding union representation and protecting workers' fundamental right to act together for their mutual aid or protection, end quote.  That is not my definition of what the NLRB is about. That is what the NLRB says on its own website. At a time of massive income and wealth inequality when 60% of our people  I live in paycheck to paycheck. We need a functioning NLRB and an aggressive general counsel who will vigorously enforce that mission and protect the constitutional right of workers to form unions and collectively bargain for better wages and benefits. Millions of American workers want to do that, and because of illegal actions on the part of the corporate world, they are unable to exercise their constitutional right.  Unfortunately, as a result of President Trump's actions, the NLRB has been effectively shut down.  What does that mean? It means that it is now much harder for workers to form a union and improve their standard of living. It means that during a union election, corporate bosses can illegally fire workers who vote to join a union. It means that corporate CEOs have free reign to illegally intimidate and coerce pro-union workers without recourse. It means that corporations can aggressively decide not to bargain in good faith.  with union workers or sign a FERS contract. And because the NLRB is now dysfunctional, workers have no recourse. And let's be clear.  President Trump's decision has already had disastrous consequences. Five months ago, workers at a Whole Foods grocery store in Philadelphia voted 130 to 100 to join the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, but Whole Foods, owned by Jeff Bezos, has ignored this union victory and has refused to bargain with the union workers as required by law.  Without a functioning NLRB, Whole Foods cannot be held accountable for its illegal behavior. And that has happened in Chicago at Mouser Packaging. Similarly, it has happened at Mass General Brigham Hospital, where 88% of primary care physicians voted to join a union, but the hospital is challenging this union victory. And without a functioning NLRB, it remains to be seen whether they are going to be able to do what they have voted to do.  Mr. Chairman, let's be clear. Replacing the most effective NLRB general counsel in modern history with someone who has spent her career representing some of the most notorious union busters in America will not make this situation any better. It will only make it worse. Crystal Carey, Trump's nominee, is a corporate attorney who has represented Amazon and Dollar General and many other corporations  that have worked relentlessly to prevent workers from forming unions. That is the nominee for General Counsel of the NLRB. In fact, Amazon  One of Ms. Carey's clients is working overtime to abolish the NLRB. Incredibly, this company absurdly believes that this independent board that was established by Congress 90 years ago is unconstitutional. So further, we will also be considering the nomination of Brittany Panuccio to serve on the EEOC. Like Ms. Carey, Ms. Panuccio has also represented powerful corporate interest.  Bottom line is that at a time when workers want to join unions, are benefiting from joining unions, I think the folks we have in front of us are not doing the job that workers need. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With that, we'll hear from our witnesses. We're joined today by Crystal Carey, President Trump's nominee for the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board.  Ms. Carey is a former NLRB field agent and staff member at the NLRB's Office of Appeals. She's currently a partner at Morgan Lewis. She's a graduate of the University of Georgia and Old Dominion University. She earned her JD from Pennsylvania State University. I look forward to hearing from her today and looking forward to seeing if Coach Tuberville will vote for her given that Georgia, well, never mind. So anyway, Ms. Carey."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 421.568, "text": " Thank you. Dr. Cassidy, Ranking Member Sanders, and other committee members, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I am truly grateful for President Trump's nomination. There is no greater honor I could imagine than to be considered for the General Counsel position, as I have spent almost my entire legal career focused on labor relations matters  and practicing at and before the National Labor Relations Board. My husband, PJ, our three daughters, Claire, Grace, and Alice, and my mom, Betty, are seated behind me. I'm lucky to have them as always cheering me on. I was born in Athens, Georgia, and raised in nearby Franklin County. My parents divorced when I was around two, and my mom made the decision to live close to her family.  That included her parents, my papa, Stanley, who worked at Victoria Bryant State Park as a ranger, my grandma, Elsie, who worked as a seamstress in the Carwoods sewing plant.  My late Uncle Del, a tow truck driver, an Army veteran, and my Uncle JR, who worked in the construction industry and is a member of the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 926. My mom always worked multiple jobs at a time, but her primary job and where she retired from was my home away from home, the University of Georgia. Go Dawgs.  Most of my childhood was spent on Park Road in a single wide trailer on my grandparents' property. I read every day, recorded my homework on cassette tape so that my mom could check it on her way to her various jobs, watched Jeopardy, Gunsmoke, and Wheel of Fortune nightly with my grandparents.  I'm a proud product of public schools. I attended Royston Elementary, Franklin County Middle School, and Franklin County High School. Thanks to Georgia's dual enrollment program, I attended Emanuel College, now a university, and earned my associate's degree just one year after graduating from high school. I then transferred to the University of Georgia, where I completed bachelor's degrees in sociology and criminal justice, all first for my family.  It was in my final semester at UGA that I met my now husband of 23 years. We moved shortly thereafter to Norfolk, where I attended Old Dominion University and obtained my master's degree in applied sociology. Subsequent military transfers allowed me the opportunity to attend Florida Coastal School of Law in Penn State Dickinson. During my final semester at Dickinson Law, I participated in the Semester in D.C. program. Through that program, I attended  and it turned with the National Labor Relations Board Region 5 office. That's Baltimore. This was my first true experience with labor law, and I loved it. I loved the people with whom I worked, the members of public I was able to help, and the sometimes feisty interactions with both union and management officials.  It was an agency that, at its heart, helped people. After graduation and passing the bar, I was offered a position there, and I happily accepted. While working in Region 5, I investigated unfair labor practice, conducted elections, served as a hearing officer, and litigated. Most of the cases I handled were filed against employers, and ultimately, most cases settled. One of the biggest cases I worked on in Region 5 involved bargaining, allegations, and an unfair labor practice strike involving almost 50 members of the Teamsters Local 639.  We won the case, and ultimately the Supreme Court agreed with the NLRB's position that the company had acted unlawfully and awarded almost $1.1 million in back pay to those employees. I will never forget and have never forgotten sitting with those witnesses days on end and hearing the impact of that case on their families.  After three years in Region 5, I spent three years in the Office of Appeals. In that office, I reviewed appeals for parties who felt that their cases should have gone differently. I handled hundreds, but one stands out to me in particular. A case was dismissed alleging that employees had been unlawfully coerced during an organizing campaign. The allegation was that employees were promised green cards for them and their family members in exchange for their vote. The promise came from the union.  not the employer. I argue that the appeal should have been sustained because the employees testified that they were coerced and they truly believed  that they would get those green cards if only they voted for the union. My argument was not adopted. The promises of the union were brushed to the side because the union couldn't make them happen, even though the employees didn't know that. I will also never forget that case. My final three years were spent on the board side serving as senior staff counsel to the chairman, and in that role, I reviewed exceptions, presented arguments, and wrote decisions for the board.  I left the board in 2018 to join the team at Morgan Lewis. My practice focuses on three primary areas, negotiations, training,  and counseling employers on whether and how to ensure their operations or potential actions comply with the law. The NLRB was established as and remains an independent agency, and the NLRA was passed to promote labor stability. There cannot be stability in labor relations when there is not stability in the law. If confirmed as general counsel, I commit to respecting longstanding board precedent.  to not putting the desire to clarify board law over the resolution of a case that would otherwise effectuate the Act, to applying the laws written and intended by Congress, and to committing to the training and the support that the hardworking employees of the NLRB and ensuring that they have the resources they need to effectuate the Act.  I take seriously the trust that comes with public service. The NLRA touches the lives of millions of American workers and businesses, large and small. Across every sector of the economy, I commit to faithfully serving the statutory mission of the National Labor Relations Board and the people the Act protects. Thank you again for having me here today and considering my nomination. I truly see it as a privilege to be here, and I look forward to all of your questions."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 776.77, "text": " Senator Tuberville, will you introduce the next witness? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much. It's an honor to introduce my friend and constituent, Dr. Brian Christine. Also thrilled to welcome today his wife, Alina, and sister Kathleen. Thank you for being here. Dr. Christine is a board certified urolic surgeon with nearly 30 years of clinical experience serving patients in Birmingham, Alabama.  A recognized medical expert, Dr. Christine is known for teaching and demonstrating advanced surgical techniques, both nationally and internationally. Born in West Germany to a decorated U.S. Army combat veteran and the grandson of Italian immigrants, he will bring a lifelong dedication to service, resilience, and American values to this role. Dr. Christine attended college in Georgia. What's going on here?  and earned his medical degree from Emory University. He later moved to Birmingham for his residency and has since dedicated his career to caring for the men and women of Alabama. Beyond the operating room, he has supported local law enforcement by volunteering as a trauma surgeon.  with tactical police units. If confirmed, Dr. Christine will oversee critical public health programs, regional health offices, and U.S. Public Health Service Commission Court, where he has pledged to accept commission and lead with a main street medicine approach. His top priorities include addressing chronic disease such as diabetes, hypertension, pediatric obesity, mental health, and the nation's physician shortage crisis. He is particularly focused on expanding access to primary care  and improving health in rural and underserved communities. With deep medical expertise, leadership experience, and a clear vision for reform, he is well-equipped to serve as Assistant Secretary for Health, and I hope my federal colleagues will support his nomination. Dr. Christine.  Senator Tuberville, thank you so much for your kind words. Thank you also for the service that you've rendered to our nation here in the U.S. Senate and the service you have and will render to our home state of Alabama. Chairman Cassidy, Ranking Member Sanders, members of the committee, good morning. It is truly a pleasure to be here and to have been nominated to be the next Assistant Secretary for Health by President Trump.  I want to thank President Trump and Secretary Kennedy for the trust they have put in me to help with the mission of making America healthy again. With me today, as you've heard, is my wife, Helena Christine. Helena is my rock, my best friend, and a compass that orients me toward what is good and just. Watching from home is my daughter, Maria Christine Mims. Maria is a mother of two beautiful little girls and, by training, is a special education teacher.  My sister, also a special education teacher, is here to support me, and my older brother, a judge, is supporting me from his home state of Florida. From the earliest times that I can recall as a child, I wanted to be a physician. I was blessed to be able to attend one of the best medical schools in the world, Emory University in Atlanta.  And I still possess the fire in my heart that ignited when I took the Hippocratic Oath 34 years ago, a burning commitment to love my patients, to treat them with compassion, and to act with integrity. I trained as a urologic surgeon at the University of Alabama, completing my residency, attaining and maintaining board certification, and have practiced in Alabama for over 30 years, specializing in men's health.  The vast majority of my patients are prostate cancer survivors. My team and I have treated patients from not just the United States, but from Europe, Asia, Canada, and South America.  My practice in prosthetic urology and men's health is recognized both within the United States and internationally as a true center of excellence in no small part because of the support of my partners, the assistance of my amazingly committed surgical team, and those surgeons who have mentored me along the way. I have earned a reputation as a thought leader, a surgical innovator, and a medical educator.  And I tell you about my practice because I want you to understand that if confirmed, the perspective that I will bring to the Department of Health and Human Services is a perspective shaped by a career spent in day-to-day patient care. Treatment decisions and hard conversations with patients and their loved ones happen in the clinic or in the emergency room or at the bedside. They happen in community hospitals and medical offices and that is where I practice and that is what I know.  Every organization, if it is to be successful, must have someone in a leadership position who lives and works on Main Street. Every workday for the past 34 years, I have listened to and interacted with patients. Every day, I have heard doctors and nurses discuss the challenges faced in the fight to provide care for their patients.  Every day, these same healthcare providers and patients have voiced concerns regarding limitations placed by insurance providers, hospital administrators, rising drug costs, and a shrinking number of physicians and nurses. Now, understanding the link that I provide to actual patient-centered healthcare, I sit before you today to state that there is a crisis.  Our nation's healthcare institutions and policies are broken, and this has real world effects at every stop in the system. Healthcare providers, nurses, physicians, allied health professionals are overworked, they're discouraged, and they're retiring from active patient care in numbers that will be more than difficult to replace. Nurses are the backbone of patient-centered care in the United States, and yet over 50% report burnout and emotional exhaustion.  Nurse retirement rates are accelerating. An astounding 20% plan retirement in just the next five years. And similarly, job dissatisfaction among physicians is at an all-time high. Many of us are fed up with administrative and documentation burdens and a lack of control over patient care. And physician retirement, too, is accelerating.  Senators, if we do not take this workforce crisis seriously and take action to address it, the shortage of doctors and nurses will number not in the thousands, but it will number in the hundreds of thousands. But perhaps most importantly,  The average American has come to distrust our healthcare system, and this distrust causes men and women to miss important cancer screenings and break appointments for follow-up of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Missed early detection of cancers and worsening of manageable conditions directly and unquestionably has led to early death, lost workforce production, and accelerated healthcare costs for everyone.  But in the midst of this crisis, I do see hope. My boots on the ground practice of medicine and surgery allows me to take the pulse of Americans, both figuratively and literally. And what I see, what I hear, and what is growing is a feeling among so many that President Trump and his administration are truly, truly focused on understanding and curing chronic disease.  Across the political, economic, and racial spectrum, there is enthusiasm for Secretary Kennedy's commitment to improving the quality of our food, ridding our diet of additives and chemicals that other countries ban, and promoting radical, radical transparency.  And tellingly, since my nomination was announced, hundreds, and I'm speaking literally, hundreds of physicians, nurses, patients, and citizens that I have not previously met have expressed a profound appreciation that the president wants a Main Street doctor in a leadership position. Interviewing with Secretary Kennedy, I told him that I will not come to Washington for a job or to start a new career. I've had my career.  But I said, I will come to execute a mission. And that mission, as part of the Health and Human Services team, will be to restore trust and confidence in health care in America, to address the looming crisis of too few health care providers,  to work with you, all of you, to eliminate our healthcare deserts, and to carry out any other part of that mission to make America healthier while always pursuing an America First agenda. I do look forward to your questions, and I ask God's blessings upon each of you and your families. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Panuccio, I've been a little light on the hammer, but try and keep it within five minutes, okay? I've been a little light,  It's gotten a little bit longer. Testifying today is Brittany Panuccio, President Trump's nominee for EEOC Commissioner. As a prosecutor, she'll be a key voice at the commission. Ms. Panuccio will work to enforce federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information. She is currently an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the 11th Circuit  and previously served at the Department of Education, Department of Justice, and as an associate at the law firm Jones Day. She's a graduate of Northwestern University and interned at the EEOC while earning her JD from Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law. I look forward to hearing from you today, ma'am, and I thank you for joining us."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1351.357, "text": "Chairman Cassidy, Ranking Member Sanders, members of the committee,  I am honored to appear here today to serve as a nominee to serve as a commissioner on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. I'm grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to serve and to continue to contribute to the EEOC's important work of preventing and remedying unlawful discrimination. I would also like to thank and honor my family.  First, thank you to my husband, Jesse, for the sacrifices he continues to make for me to be able to pursue a career in public service. I would not be here today without his support and wise counsel. He is a devoted father to our daughter, Lilia, who is the light of our lives and for everyone's benefit is at home napping right now.  Thank you to my parents, David and Leslie Bull, for raising me to love God and this country and for the innumerable sacrifices they made for their children. Through my parents, I have witnessed the blessings and challenges of owning a small business. My father worked tirelessly to provide his children with so many more opportunities than he had. My mother has shown me how to be a Proverbs 31 woman and gracefully balance motherhood and a career.  I strive to be a role model for my daughter, as my mother is for me. Finally, thank you to my brother and sister-in-law, Ryan Bull and Jordan Fowler, for their love and support.  While in law school, I interned in the Chicago district office of the EEOC. So this is a full circle moment for me to be here over a decade later as the president's nominee to be an EEOC commissioner. Congress has given the EEOC a critical mission, preventing and remedying discrimination in our nation's workplaces.  This mission reflects foundational promises of this great nation, that all Americans are inherently created equal and are entitled to equal treatment under the law. Americans have a right to be treated in the workplace as individuals, not as members of a particular race or group, and to be judged on the content of their character, skills, and abilities, rather than the color of their skin or their sex.  These values have always been important to me. I have committed my career to civil rights, equal opportunity, and public service. After graduating from college, I served as a Teach for America Corps member, teaching eighth grade at Miami Edison Middle School in Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood. My service was rooted in the belief that all children, regardless of their zip code, should have equal access to an excellent education.  After law school, I practiced labor and employment law, litigating cases involving a wide variety of laws, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. I devoted most of my pro bono practice to representing a student with severe disabilities seeking reasonable accommodations from his public school.  During the first Trump administration, I served at the U.S. Department of Education, in the Office for Civil Rights, and the Office of the General Counsel. I advised senior department officials about legal and policy issues relating to anti-discrimination laws and regulatory reform.  I am proud to have co-authored the 2018 Title IX Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which was the precursor to the 2020 final rule that the Department enforces today. I currently serve as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of Florida. Our jurisdiction covers the same neighborhood where I taught eighth grade so many years ago.  And I vividly remember visiting one of my students after he was shot six times. And each day, I work to ensure that my former students, their families, and their neighbors can live, work, and go to school in a safe environment. As part of the Appellate Division, I litigate and argue civil and criminal appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. These cases cover a broad subject matter, including employment law.  I also personally understand the importance of civil rights laws and equal opportunity. As a child, I was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and I have benefited from disability accommodations throughout my education and professional career. I know firsthand how an accommodation as simple as having two sets of textbooks, one at home, one at school, can ensure that a child has equal access to education.  My interest in laws relating to sex discrimination also stems from personal experience. While studying abroad in college in Spain, I was raped. But I have seen God's goodness, even in the worst of times.  God has given me multiple opportunities to turn my pain into purpose.

My personal experience underscores the importance of preventing discrimination because the remedies the legal system provides, while important, can only do so much to make a victim whole again.

Dr. Christine, in my lifetime, I've never seen the deterioration of an institution like we have in the trust of the American people.  after COVID. How are you going to try to put that back together? Because we desperately need some help in getting a positive attitude towards our hospitals and our doctors back to the American people. Yes, Senator Tuberville, number one, thank you so much for being here. Again, thank you for your introduction. Thank you for meeting with me before today's hearing. I'm truly appreciative.  The loss of trust that we have seen in our healthcare institutions and the healthcare policies emanating from this city are the worst that I've seen in over three decades of practice. People feel that during the pandemic, particularly they were led astray. Some people feel they were lied to. We have to work to restore that trust. Secretary Kennedy is 100% committed to doing that, as is President Trump.  In my career as a surgeon, I've had to earn the trust of my patients, allowing me to operate on them, literally take their life within my hands. I believe I have the ability to communicate to patients and now, hopefully, to the American public at large.  and approach them and give them a sense that what I'm saying, what I'm telling, is truly for the good of the country, comes from a position of honesty and transparency. I've had to do that for over 30 years as a surgeon and as a physician. I truly believe I can bring that skill set to the office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. Yeah, the American people are tired of being lied to about their food, the ingredients, things that we're now finding out that are detrimental to our health.  And up here, we seem to overlook all that. But we need to start looking out for the American people. How do you plan to help the Secretary with that?  Well, we know that Secretary Kennedy is absolutely committed to the Make America Healthy Again agenda, to remove toxins from our foods, to make sure that all have access to clean water, that we focus on not just treating chronic disease, but finding out what causes chronic disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and work to not only cure those diseases, but really prevent and eliminate those diseases.  Secretary Kennedy is always wanting to approach things from the foundation of science. He truly believes in that. I agree with the Secretary on all of those things. I intend to support him. I intend to work diligently, if I have the privilege of being confirmed, to support him in that quest to make Americans healthier than they've ever been. Thank you. Ms. Pannunzio, is that how you pronounce it? Pannunzio. Pannunzio, yeah. You've expressed some concern  that some DEI-based hiring practices may violate anti-discrimination laws.

Yes, Senator, I think one of the things you're speaking about are healthcare deserts, those areas where men, women, and their children don't have ready access to primary care services such as pediatrics or gynecologic services or family practice. We have to find ways to bridge those gaps. I think that absolutely telehealth can help provide a bridge to these individuals. We'll see what AI brings in the future, but again, technology can help bridge this gap.  We absolutely must encourage and must increase the number of primary care physicians, family practitioners, pediatricians, gynecologists, and obstetricians, and primary care nurses and nurses to help bridge this gap as well. Now, that takes a while to spin that up, but in the interim, we have to find ways to bridge the gaps. We do have to use technology. I believe that I, as Assistant Secretary for Health, one of the things that I intend to do if I'm privileged to be in that position will be to be a true evangelist  to really go out and encourage young men and women who are in medical school and nursing school to serve in these areas. Young men and women getting into healthcare, they want a mission. I want to help them understand that that mission to serve our brothers and sisters in rural American healthcare deserts is truly noble and is worthwhile. And one thing we need to sell to in rural hospitals is loyalty to the people in these communities to go to these rural hospitals so we can save them.

Would you agree with me that there is something wrong where we, the wealthiest nation on earth, are the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right? Senator Sanders, number one, thank you so much for being here today. I'm sorry that we didn't have a chance to meet before this meeting, but I do appreciate your time today.  Senator Sanders, Secretary Kennedy believes, and I agree, that every American deserves to be healthy. And that is the crux of the MAHA agenda. We believe- I don't mean to be rude. I don't have a lot of time. Simple question. Every other major country guarantees health care to all people. Do you think the United States should do the same? I think that we must make it clear that every American has the opportunity to be healthy, that they have access- You're not answering the question.  in all due respect. Let me ask you this. Recently, the Senate, against my vote, voted for the reconciliation package, which, according to the CBO, will throw 17 million people off of the health care that they currently have through massive cuts in Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. Do you think we're making America healthy by throwing 17 million people off the health care they have? Senator Sanders, again, I thank you for the question.  No one, and President Trump has been clear about this, no one wants to remove Medicaid benefits from truly deserving beneficiaries. However, we do know that there are inefficiencies in the system. We know there are costs. 17 million people are going to be thrown off the health care they have. Is that making America healthy? Truly. The individuals who are most deserving and truly deserve Medicaid will continue to be covered.  In terms of making America healthy, do you think that vaccines are safe and effective? If confirmed, will you use your position to educate Americans about the importance of getting vaccinated?  Senator Sanders, once again, thank you for your time and thank you for your question today. Let me be clear to this committee. I believe, as does Secretary Kennedy, that vaccines save lives. I believe that vaccines are an important part of the armamentarium that we have to help prevent disease in this country. I support vaccinations.  just as Secretary Kennedy does. And what we also support is the right of every individual to make informed consent decisions about what's right for them or for their children. Well, in all due respect, I don't know that that is Secretary Kennedy's position. He has spent years trying to undermine  the belief and the faith in vaccines in this country.

Ms. Carey, I wanna talk with you briefly about something that I learned at the NLRB,  It's taken a long time to clear cases out there. The median age of all the cases at the NLRB in the past year was 154 days. That's up from 106 days. That's a long time. People need to get these issues settled so they can move on with life. And it appears that the Biden administration was guilty of  forcing that extension because they were focused on overturning decades of precedent in labor law, which stretched it out. And the NLRB, rather than handing in cases before the board in a timely manner based on precedent, were trying to set new precedents. And I want to just ask you,  Is that your take on the situation?

I think that when you have a general counsel who is trying to overturn a majority of every decision ever held by a Republican board, that definitely puts a lot of stress on the field agents who are doing their best to keep up with all of the cases that come in. One of the biggest things that I want to do and priority-wise is to do an organizational assessment to understand exactly what is causing those backlogs.  If it is this heavy reliance on the need to overturn precedent, as I said in my opening statement, I respect for a longstanding board precedent, and I don't see a reason to let the sake of trying to overturn a case get in the way of an employee who has filed a charge getting a quicker resolution."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2647.206, "text": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

The Secretary gave no reason for the pause, no indication whether or when the funds might be restored. These Boys and Girls Clubs essentially start their programming when the school year starts, which for many of my jurisdictions is in one month, and they don't know whether they can keep the doors open. I hope we might have a further discussion about this on the committee when we next have an education-focused hearing.  Dr. Christine, about 18% of Americans have experienced long COVID at some point in the last five years. 25% of people who currently have long COVID have debilitating symptoms, unable to work, housing insecurity, mental health challenges, and other challenges. I've been pretty open on this committee since January of 2021 about my own journey with thankfully mild long COVID.  symptoms that have not gone away in five years. And others, Senators, both Democratic and Republican, members of this committee, current and former, have also shared long COVID experiences, both personally and of family members. Given the Secretary's goal to address chronic conditions, I was disappointed  that the administration ended the Department of HHS's Office of Long COVID Research and Practice, which coordinated a whole series of government efforts to look at research causes, cures, treatments. The administration has also undermined the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which established a long COVID care network. Let me just ask you this. Do you believe that long COVID is real?  So Senator Kaine, number one, thank you for being here today. Thank you for taking the time. Can I just say this? You don't need to thank me for being here. My Virginians sent me here, and I thank them. I'm supposed to be here. I'm just doing my job. And I don't need a thank you from anybody for just doing my job. But I'd like to hear whether you think long COVID is real. Sure.  Well, certainly the COVID pandemic was devastating for this country, devastating in the loss of life, the individuals who suffered, and as we've said, devastating to the prior administration's approach and causing the loss of confidence. And how about President Trump suggesting LIDA as a treatment or injection of Invermectin? You talk about loss of confidence and you want to put it on somebody's shoulders.  You're ignoring a whole lot of misinformation that was perpetrated by the previous information. But that's not the question I asked you. I asked you the question of whether long COVID is real.  Well, we certainly need to continue to collect data on individuals who've suffered from COVID. So you're not sure about whether long COVID is real or not? Would that be a fair statement? So we need to continue to collect data. Okay, I'm going to take that as you're not yet sure about long COVID. Do you think long COVID is a chronic condition? I think that absolutely. We are early on in this experience with COVID, just a few years, which is just a blink of an eye. Okay, so you haven't reached a conclusion yet.  puzzling that Secretary Kennedy says he wants to focus on chronic conditions, but he's undermining and shutting down an office that was designed to look at a chronic condition. Let me ask you this, as a provider, would you recommend your patients get a COVID vaccine?  I think that COVID vaccine, like any medical therapy or any vaccine, is gonna have inherent risks and benefits. Would you recommend that a patient of yours gets a COVID vaccine? When I've practiced medicine in these over three decades, I've always hinged my practice on informed consent. Okay, let me ask you this. So you've practiced medicine for three decades. Have you never recommended to a patient who've said, hey doc, you're an expert, I'm not. What's your recommendation? When somebody says that to you, do you give them a recommendation?  Certainly within the realm of urologic surgery, I've given recommendations. Okay, so you give them a recommendation. But you would not feel comfortable giving a recommendation to a patient to get a COVID vaccine? What I would feel most comfortable with is making sure that the patient has access to good information. Okay, well that is pretty darn troubling, as was your answer in the question that  Senator Hassan asked, she asked all witnesses whether if you were given a directive by the President Secretary that you thought violated the law, would you follow the directive or follow the law? Your other panelists said, I would never be given such a directive, but I will always follow the law. You were the one witness who could not make yourself say that final clause, that you would always follow the law. And I think a lot of people noticed that. I yield back.  Senator Mikulski."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 49, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 3712.672, "text": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for being here. Dr. Christine, I just want to just quickly follow on from my friend from Virginia and his request on long COVID and your views. You've indicated that you're continuing to collect data. If you would like additional data from the state of Alaska, I can certainly supply you with names of individuals who have presented  these matters to me with great concern and a desire to understand more. I'm going to direct my first questions to you, Ms. Carey. I appreciated the fact that we had a chance to have some discussion yesterday. You've spoken here this morning about  the issues with regards to staffing levels at the NLRB, kind of how we got there. And I think some constructive ways to how to approach it. Know that in my state of Alaska, this issue of this backlog and how long it is taking to process these claims, it matters. And so if I can urge you to pay attention to certain broader issues that are going to help us in Alaska,  It's certainly on the issue of staffing and being able to address backlog. You have shared with me your belief that NLRB is an independent federal agent there to safeguard employees' rights, ensure fair labor practices. I appreciate that.  that view, and also one that we discussed, which is your concern that we see a lack of stability, really, within the NLRB, where you have precedent that has been established over years, a withdrawal or a pullback from that, and the discussion about how we can focus more on continued  or greater stability. I think that that is going to be important within the NLRB as well. I mentioned to you, I am a Republican that has a good, strong relationship with labor in Alaska. I want to be able to continue that. And I think my ability to do that is when labor feels that the independent agencies are acting fair, that they are working to uphold  the National Labor Relations Act fairly. One issue that I didn't raise yesterday was the fact that in my state we have about half the federally recognized tribes in the country. We have a number of tribes and Alaska Native corporations that operate both public and private sector  enterprises. These are significant economic drivers for us, particularly in rural parts of the state. As NLRB's general counsel, how would you approach questions of labor law as they relate to sovereign entities or complex jurisdictional questions, as we certainly have there in Alaska?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 50, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 3914.807, "text": "Thank you, Senator.

So, I agree with you, and as we discussed, the NLRB has been an independent agency since it was established in 1935, and any prosecutorial discretion that comes to me, I don't take lightly. In terms of jurisdictional issues, those are complex, but also guided by the statute. And, you know, as I'm willing to take input and provide technical assistance to any questions that we have in relation to any potential jurisdictional issues,  Those are pretty fact-intensive and would require a little more than I can probably give here to you today, but I'm willing to work with you moving forward on those questions."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 51, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 3954.521, "text": "Well, it's an important issue to us, so I'm happy to have more conversations with you about that.

Many in my state choose to compact their IHS funds to manage their own health care programs. The Alaska Native Tribal Compact tribally manages hospitals in Anchorage and Barrow, Bethel, Dillingham, Kotzebue, Nome, and Sitka. These are significant facilities. So I would ask for your commitment  if you are confirmed for this position, to ensure that we have true tribal consultation.

I support Helena in that. I support a woman's choice to go ahead and pursue any career she might want or a man.

And you would be, sir, really responsible as well for  implementing policies that uplift health issues for women in the United States. And so I want to make sure that you understand that this is going to be very important to so many people. I want to ask you about another area, for example, regarding teen pregnancy and whether you believe the teen pregnancy prevention programs are important.  Well, ma'am, I'm a biologist by training. I'm a scientist. I believe that young men and women should, when the age is appropriate, be educated about the biology and physiology of reproduction. I believe that when it comes to education regarding sexual intimacy, sexual intercourse, birth prevention, that is best in the purview of the parents. I strongly believe that. So teen pregnancy programs, for example, Alabama has an adolescent pregnancy prevention branch.  And I wonder whether or not you believe that this kind of program is important. Again, I absolutely support that parents should be the individuals to discuss sexuality and those kinds of things. No, I'm not asking you about parents. I'm asking you whether or not you believe that these kinds of government-supported programs, and specifically this teen prevention pregnancy program, is important. Yes, I absolutely believe that that kind of education for kids comes from the parents best.  OK, so you do not believe, for example, in the federal funding that would help to support an important program like a teen pregnancy prevention program. And I note your own state helped, for example, Alabama dramatically reduce its teen birth rate over the past 30 years by 78% by using a program like that one.  But you are saying now that you believe that that kind of program should be eliminated. Is that what you believe? Ma'am, what I believe is that as I support the Secretary to work to make America healthy again, we are going to do our utmost to make sure we pursue that agenda. We are certainly going to support the right of parents to make medical decisions for their kids."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 65, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 4344.013, "text": "Yeah, I know, Dr. Christine. I'm asking you about, not about parents. We're here talking about the federal government today and whether or not these kinds of programs deserve federal funding.

Ms. Carey, let me just start with you, if I could. I want to talk a little bit about some NLRB precedents and your views on them. Let's start with captive audience meetings. The NLRB decided last year, I believe it was, that captive audience meetings, these are the meetings where workers are forced to sit through mandatory sessions with the employer  often being told by the employer why they should not unionize, perhaps being threatened implicitly or explicitly. I emphasize these are mandatory meetings now, employer with employee. The NLRB decided last year that these captive audience meetings are not consistent with labor law.

Dr. Kustin, Secretary Kennedy announced that he had plans for the Department to mine, quote-unquote mine, extract and utilize the data from Medicare and Medicaid claims to inform his investigation into the causes of autism.  Now, this database would include information from wearable devices like an Apple Watch or an Auro Ring, things like that. Now, as a physician, and obviously I think you obviously understand the value of personal health privacy, does this concern you? So, Senator, number one, thank you for being here, sir. I'm sorry we didn't have the chance to meet.  You know, in terms of pursuing the Make America Healthy agenda, we know that the Secretary is absolutely committed to doing that, to collecting data and operating from a position of science. I have not spoken to the Secretary or heard specifically his thoughts about the wearable devices, and I would want to do that before I made comment. And if confirmed, I commit to you that I would certainly have that discussion and be happy to discuss that with you again.  Sure, and make a commitment to ensure that the database and all these other collection efforts at the HHS uphold the highest levels of privacy. Well, we absolutely want to respect patients' privacy, and we absolutely want to pursue the ending of chronic diseases. Great. Thank you.  Ms. Carey, the President's budget request proposed cutting NLRB by $14 million, roughly 5% of the budget.

Fair enough. Dr. Christine, HHS has released an updated guidance on the eligibility for the COVID-19 vaccine. Some groups of individuals who've previously been covered now will not be covered.  or likely will not be covered. And this has caused a certain level, significant level of concern between patients and providers as to which vaccines will be covered by insurance and who might be forced to pay out of pocket for those costs. So are you concerned this is going to require physician offices to do even more administrative, burdensome work to figure out who has coverage, who doesn't?  while at the same time doing all the things you've got to do, provide medical advice, you know, make sure you're taking care of that patient. Sure. Senator, thank you so much for that question. Secretary Kennedy has always been clear, and he believes we need to follow the science when it comes to any kind of medical therapy, and that would apply to vaccines and to immunizations. Regarding what is recommended, what is on the schedule, we know  that science is not static, science is dynamic, it can change over time, and certainly the Secretary wants us to be able, if science in the future and data leads us down the road where we need to make changes to the schedule, for instance, that we'd be willing to pivot and do that if science leads us in that direction. We always wanna be responsible to do that in terms of coverage of the vaccines, of course, what's recommended is gonna be covered, but we have to be able to pivot, we have to be able to change if we find a need to do so in the future.  And how do you look at, when you say science directs us, when there's a disagreement within the scientific establishment, how do you look at distilling out what it is that science is telling you?  Yes, I think that's an excellent question, thank you. One of the hallmarks of data that can be trusted or believed is reproducibility, and certainly Dr. Bhattacharya spoke to this during his hearing, that if there is, let's say, two sets of data that may not agree 100%, we'd have to have reproducibility. In other words, we can always do more studies, more science, to try to figure out what is reproducible and what is actually true, and that's probably the best way to figure out what the right answer is.  Well, certainly part of it. That's part of a longer discussion. Probably need some medical assistance. Well, I'm a urologist. I can't help with a cough. I'm sorry about that. I appreciate that. I yield back to the chair. Somehow I think your urologist may have asked you to cough, but that's OK.  I'll finish. Kind of one of the nice things about being last is that you don't have a time limit. And so I may go a little bit longer than five minutes, but that's why. Dr. Christine, I really enjoyed our visit. You had mentioned, I think you used the term, to be an evangelist for those things that would make America healthy again and to follow the science. Now, the science clearly, reproducibly, over and over again,  have shown that vaccines are safe and that vaccines do not cause autism. And there's always this little bit of chatter out there, but when it's looked at by the mainstream of what the medical scientists look at, it's considered two, three, four standard deviations out, and the data over and over again reproducibly shows that they're safe and are not associated with autism.  Right now, we have a measles outbreak. We had two children die of vaccine-preventable diseases in West Texas. We had a pregnant woman lose her baby in Canada because she was exposed to someone who did not get vaccinated for measles, showing that we have a mutual responsibility. Just saying get vaccinated if you want to doesn't work for the pregnant woman who was then exposed, and she loses her baby. And we're both pro-life, but you don't have to be pro-life to see that as an incredible tragedy.  Are you willing to be an evangelist to tell people that vaccines have reproducibly been shown to be safe, and that by golly, you should be vaccinated so we don't lose another child? So, Senator, I, too, enjoyed the time we had together. And Dr. Cassidy, I truly appreciated that day. As I've said here before the committee, I believe that vaccines save lives. I believe strongly that vaccines are an important part of our armamentarium as we promote public health and prevent disease.  If even one individual dies from a preventable disease, a disease that could be prevented by vaccination, that's certainly one too many. And I believe Secretary Kennedy feels that same way.  I will certainly use my position, if confirmed, as the Assistant Secretary for Health, to promote the health and the wellness of people in this country. I believe that vaccines are important. I believe that vaccinations are appropriate. My child is vaccinated. I also believe very strongly that vaccines, like any kind of medical therapy, are individual. And of course, there are going to be inherent risks and benefits with any medical therapy. Let me stop you for a second. Of course, there's always risk.  but there's been a lot of emphasis upon the risk, but no emphasis upon the risk of not being vaccinated. People don't die from getting vaccinated with measles. They just don't. People do die if they don't get vaccinated, or they have a chronic condition which shows up 13 years later, or if the child that was in utero when exposed is born may end up mentally retarded when otherwise they would have lived a long life. So I agree with you that there is this kind of set of side effects.  But I think we would both agree, because you mentioned earlier you're basically an applied biologist.  that the overwhelming weight of evidence is that these vaccines are safe, they are effective, they prevent death, they prevent chronic disease. Would you be an evangelist on that, ma'am? I will absolutely be an evangelist, that vaccinations are important. Vaccines do save lives. I personally would recommend the measles vaccine. I believe that Secretary Kennedy is now doing the same. And so I will use that position to be an evangelist, to help individuals understand and to bring them to want to pursue  the appropriate vaccination schedule and what's right for them. So I guess the short answer to your question is yes.  Ms. Carey, I'm not an attorney. I'm a gastroenterologist. Like, what do I know about logs if I don't like attorneys? No offense. I listened very carefully to your exchange with Dr. Hawley. Mr. Hawley, I'm sorry. I'm into it now with Christine. So, am I to say that if, see if I interpret this correctly, because Hawley had some points there.  if there is a regional staff that investigates a claim upon the issue, upon your saying, well, there's prosecutorial discretion, that the regional staff would have the ability to pursue that claim under the current precedent, or were you saying that, no, you might pull that from them based upon your own discretion? I don't know, I'm just asking."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 125, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 5702.785, "text": " Thank you. The answer is the way that you presented it is correct. So once a new claim would come up in relation to the captive audience decision, the accident precedent is the Amazon decision.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep concern over the weaponization of ICE by the Trump administration. Just this weekend, I had a chance to see Trump borders are Tom Homan talking about how the administration is conducting the sweeps on the streets and that they're doing it to prioritize public safety and national security. But the facts tell a different story.  According to CBS, only 8% of those detained have been convicted of violent crimes. The conservative Cato Institute found that only 7% of detainees were violent criminals. In fact, most detainees aren't even criminals at all. Of the people in detention, about half of them have criminal records. That's 300,000 people who are detained who do not have criminal records at all.  This administration is not actually prioritizing the most dangerous people, even though President Trump promised on the campaign trail that that's exactly what he would do. Mr. Homan also said that his administration always follows the law. But last week, a federal judge ordered ICE to stop conducting roving patrols, stop the sweeping arrests without reasonable suspicion, and stop denying access to lawyers.  Mr. Speaker, the findings in this case are shocking. This is some of the worst examples of racial profiling I've seen, even during my 12 years as a prosecutor. For example, some people were waiting at bus stops and having coffee, were then surrounded by ICE agents and unmarked vehicles.  that sped up in their direction. They leapt out with masks on and their guns drawn and ran immediately toward these individuals. They then handcuffed these individuals and forced them into vehicles and drove them away. All of this was done before they'd even asked them for identification. The men thought they were being kidnapped. Some of them then had their feet, hands, and wrists shackled, and another man even had a gun pointed at him.  The court who was reviewing these cases questioned what was it about the bus stop that caused these ICE agents to believe they had reasonable suspicion to detain these men. Reasonable suspicion means that there is evidence at the time that each of these men had committed a crime or were in the process of committing of the crime. What was the basis of the ICE agent's reasonable suspicion?  The case reviewed it and found that the government said it was based on their past experiences, quote, have demonstrated that illegal aliens utilize and seek to work at certain places, like getting their car washed or waiting for the bus. Nothing about these men suggested that they were in the country illegally or about to commit a crime at the time that they were stopped. They didn't even ask for ID.  before they were gun-faced and then handcuffed and taken away. The bottom line is that these men were taken into custody simply because they were Latino. Clearly, these tactics are unconstitutional. The use of race is the basis for grabbing people on the street. The courts have long ago ruled are across the line and illegal. These tactics threaten some of the most basic important principles that serve as the backbone for our nation, the rule of law.  Like the unlawful deportation of Kilmar Obrego-Garcia and the willful defiance of a unanimous Supreme Court decision to bring him back, the Trump administration is unapologetic in its efforts to target immigrants, Constitution, and law be damned.  In addition to being unconstitutional, this wastes a great deal of tax dollars because they're detaining masses of people in these large sweeps only to have to release them when proof of their legal status is shown. And it also horrifies the citizens who have to go through this experience. We now have Latino citizens who are afraid to leave their house to go to work or even to go to court.  Remember, the so-called Venezuelan violent gang members deported to the Gulag in El Salvador. As it turned out, according to the Cato Institute, 50 of those men, not only were they not criminals, their paperwork was in order, they were in the United States legally, and they hadn't committed any kind of crimes in El Salvador or Venezuela at all. Instead of focusing on criminals, they're grabbing people, like the 64-year-old mother who was gardening in New Orleans.  the father of three Marines who has been working in the United States for decades, or yesterday when ICE raided a baseball summer camp. This is not the best use of our federal law enforcement agents. I'm a former federal and state prosecutor. I deeply respect the rule of law and understand the responsibility elected officials have to protect it.  We've got to do better than this. Let's focus on getting violent criminals off the street. There are more than 100,000 open warrants in the United States on any given day. Let's focus on those. And let's move forward in a way that respects the Constitution. And with that, I yield back."}], "keywords": ["Trump"], "summary": {"Aaron McLaughlin": null, "Adrian Broadus": null, "Al Roker": null, "Albert Bourla": null, "Alexander Bolton": null, "Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Andy_Harris": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill Ferries": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brian_Moynihan": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Camila Bernal": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Ian King": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jay_Powell": null, "Jensen Wang": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Hawley": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Julien_Pontus": null, "Karen Bass": null, "Karen Moskow": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Kate Snow": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Keir Simmons": null, "Kelly O'Donnell": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Kyle Schwarber": null, "Lara Trump": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Leslie Picker": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Kinsella": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Michael Rappaport": null, "Mike Johnson": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nathan Hager": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Pam Bondi": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Pete Alonso": null, "Phil Murphy": null, "Rob Parker": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker condemns the Trump administration's ICE sweeps, asserting they are not prioritising public safety as claimed.

Four years ago or so, the Biden administration tried to put in a rule to allow the Treasury Department to have full access to every bank account of the American people.  There was a universal revolt against that policy. Nancy Pelosi stripped that provision out of one of their reconciliation packages. CBDCs, I know this is very technical, but a central bank digital currency would essentially give the Federal Reserve an ability  to examine and monitor all stablecoin transactions in the United States. And so that's what members do not want to happen. I'm opposed. The Republican conference is opposed. These 12 members are vehemently opposed.

We're going to talk about the politics of today, to be sure, but there's also going to be national security conversations.  There's going to be public health conversations. We're talking about foreign policy. We're going to talk about economics, about immigration, about the topics that people really care about, that matter, that impact them with some of the biggest players from the Trump administration, again, on both sides of the aisle.

As you remember, about a dozen Republicans blocked a vote to advance to voting on the crypto bills. But there was a late night meeting last night at the White House. Trump tweeted out that the members are now on board and the House is preparing to move forward today. And so here's what we're going to see. Over the next two days, the House is set to pass three major bills that the crypto industry has been asking for.  One deals with regulations on stable coins. That's the Genius Act we've been talking about. The other is a bill called Clarity. Now, that's a market structure bill, and it defines the market for digital assets, when they're a security, when they're going to be a commodity. And then you've got a final bill that would ban the creation of a central bank digital currency, a CBDC. Now, a redo of yesterday's procedural vote to advance to all three that's coming up here a little afternoon.  But what's important to remember is that while there are three different bills, they're on two different tracks. So that stablecoin bill already passed the Senate, got a good bipartisan vote. We're expecting similar in the House. The House, at this point, it seems likely to pass it tomorrow. Either way, we expect it to pass. We expect it could be signed into law before the end of the week.  Today, the House is looking at potentially voting on the two other bills, market structure and the central bank digital currency. Both of those bills, though, they're not done with the House. They would then need to go to the Senate. And because those bills are more complex, they're likely to take a little bit longer to get done or a lot longer, depending how negotiations go.  Senator Cynthia Lummis, she's working on a Senate version of the House market structure bill, and she told me yesterday that they expect to have a draft of their bill out this week, but they might not start actually moving it forward until the fall or even later. Now, some sources I've spoken with in the industry and on Capitol Hill  See, there is a real question whether all three can get done or if it will just be stable coin. But it sounds like the pressure is certainly on these lawmakers to be able to move this, especially market structure, because, guys, that's the one that a lot of these crypto industries want.

The House Freedom Caucus members, some of these hardline conservatives, they really want to keep the pressure on. They are concerned that a central bank digital currency could lead to potential surveillance of Americans' financial transactions. And so that was what they were pushing for. I did speak with one of the holdouts today, Congressman Michael Cloud.

But there were a couple of breakthroughs that came yesterday. There was a lot of concern for these Republican senators that funding was going to be cut.  for a program that's meant to stop and prevent AIDS. Yesterday, after lunch with OMB Director Russ Voigt, Republicans came to an agreement to leave that funding in place, take that out of the rescissions package. That seems to have unlocked some votes, but expect more amendments to be offered this afternoon when the Senate begins the process of voting.  Keep a very close eye on what's going to happen with funding for local radio stations. That's another area that has a number of lawmakers concerned. And of course, once the Senate's done with this bill, it's going to have to go back to the House, and they have to get it done before Friday, because Friday is that 45-day deadline.

SpaceX is going to put $2 billion into XAI. Dana, you're always talking about how Elon Musk's sort of empire, they have these separate business, but they really operate as one business.

So say you buy like a Starlink satellite dish and you're in your RV and like the Internet speed is low and you want to complain to somebody like maybe a Grok chatbot like helps you troubleshoot your problem. So like I can see ways that it could all work. Also, I mean, Grok has this incredible computing power, but is it going to need to rely on space-based satellites for some of that?  So by investing, you know, SpaceX will have dibs. I mean, at some point, XAI is going to have to grow a real board, I would imagine. Like, they don't really have a board right now.

And everyone was like, oh, Tesla's acquiring a solar company. And it's like, no, you guys, Elon is the chair of the board of SolarCity. This is a bailout. And so, I mean, the cost of going to Mars is huge. So I think $2 billion is not  That's like a significant, I think it's SpaceX's largest outside investment.

Nobody wants to be cut out from the business of Elon Musk. And so as a result, no one is willing to say, is this the best use of $2 billion or $5 billion? Should you be propping up your AI business with monies from the private space exploration company?  Who wants to raise their hand and complain about that and then be cut out from the next big thing that Elon does because investing in Elon Musk historically has been a very good business for venture capitalists who can get in early enough and I just don't see people willing to call him out on this.

But I wanted to bring us back because the story I was very jealous of at the time, and I think still sort of stands the test of time, is one that you wrote way back in December of last year. The title is The Silicon Valley Billionaires Steering Trump's Transition.  And there's been so much news between now and then six months ago feels like, you know, five years ago.

You took the Trump-Musk relationship from the campaign trail and sort of introduced the fact that this thing was going to last into the administration, that it wasn't just going to be Elon, but it was also going to be like all of the people who orbit Elon going into that administration as well. I think it was like a perfect table setter.  for ultimately what we ended up experiencing, you know, for those first three, four, five months of the administration. So walk me through, like, how does a story like this come together? You're on the byline with some, you know, powerhouse journalists at The Times, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan. How does this, you know, materialize for you?

So as of mid-December, it was public or had been well-reported that Elon Musk was at Mar-a-Lago since Election Day, a month prior. What was not well-known was the fact that Musk had kind of  brought in 10 to 20 of his homies to basically quasi run the transition alongside him. You know, Musk technically didn't have any role in the presidential transition. It was run by Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon, two people that Trump has known for a long time. And they both kind of divided up the transition into certain areas of responsibility, dating back to, I think, August. Then Trump's elected in November. Elon flies to Mar-a-Lago for the election night party and then never leaves.  And so what happened in November and December is there's kind of the official transition process being run by the people who are ahead of the transition.  these other people. And the reason it was an interesting story to us is because the other people were never announced. You know, it was never announced that Sean McGuire or Mark Andreessen or kind of Musk's personal family office aides were running this alongside them. And the way we heard about it should be rather obvious is that people were going in for these meetings at Mar-a-Lago to be, you know, Secretary of State or Deputy Secretary of State or whatever.  and were, you know, they weren't like surprised to walk into the room and see.  people they didn't expect, but they kind of were. They were showing up and were surprised by the extent to which they had to deal with these kind of unofficial doge or quasi-doge representatives who had no public billing and sometimes no public profile.

Season one was the best season so far. Good morning. I'm Sam Brock, by the way. We're not just talking Emmys. In for Joe today.  And I'm Savannah Sellers. Thanks for starting your Wednesday with us. We're going to begin this morning with the continued dangerous weather across the country. Today, the severe summer storm threat is shifting to the south and the Midwest. Millions of people are under extreme weather alerts as storms threaten to bring high winds and hail to mountain states like Colorado and Wyoming, while hot, humid weather hangs over the east. And heavy rains threaten to trigger more flash floods from Florida to Louisiana.  Savannah, it comes as those of us in the New York area are still drying out after record amounts of rain fell on Monday. Two people were tragically killed in New Jersey when their car was swept away by flood water below ground. Commuters capturing water rushing onto the subway platforms and even into the cars as the city saw the second highest amount of rainfall in a single hour ever recorded. Look at that vantage point.  through the car. Meteorologist Angie Lastman tracking it all for us. But we're going to begin with NBC News correspondent Shaquille Brewster. He's in Minneapolis this morning for us. Shaq, good morning. How's it looking there? Good morning, guys. Well, you're seeing there's some light rain in Minneapolis right now as this system marches across the Midwest, bringing pockets of heavy rain, pockets of thunderstorms to states like Minnesota and Iowa. Overnight, you saw a lot of this wet weather down in Virginia, where we know there was some  flash flood warnings, flash flood alerts in effect there as they dealt with some heavy rain. Of course, all of this coming after those really apocalyptic scenes in the tri-state area from Monday night where you saw in New York City that commute completely snarled the subway system.  completely overrun as that water just flooded in. You saw some roads turn into what looked like rivers and lakes. You saw rescue after rescue. We learned, unfortunately, that that rain in New Jersey did turn deadly when officials say that two people who were in a vehicle got swept away from that floodwater. Officials not able to get to them in time. And then I want you to look at this video from North Plainfield, New Jersey,  where fire officials say a house completely exploded from a likely gas leak. Where this ties into the weather is you saw scenes of firefighters fighting that blaze with about two feet of water around that house. Officials say no one was injured, fortunately, because the family evacuated that home for higher ground hours before that house ended up exploding. So no injuries there, but you see those dramatic pictures.  Of course, today the story will be the heat. You have about 70 million Americans facing some sort of heat advisory. That will be what many people out east experience. That heat that we were dealing with here in the Midwest yesterday and humidity is now heading your way. So folks are bracing for that. We know there's some  alerts and advisories in the Boston area as folks are advised to watch out for those cooling centers and do what they can to stay cool and avoid that heat as others deal with more flooding. And then, of course, out west, you have those fires. So a lot of extreme weather situations across the country that we're following this morning, guys.  melting pot of weather chaos. Thank you, Shaq. And on top of all that, there's fresh trouble in the tropics that could bring a new flood risk. NBC meteorologist Angie Laskin joining us now tracking that threat and everything else for us. There's a lot on the table, Angie."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 299.508, "text": "Good morning."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 299.969, "text": "So much, guys. Good morning to you, yes. Let's start with the tropics and then we'll get into that heat. Here's what's happening right now. We've got kind of this area of disturbed weather, a low-pressure system that's trying to get its act together. Eventually, it's going to move out over portions of the Gulf of Mexico.  We know the waters are warm there, so we likely will see this system develop. Maybe getting a name here in the next couple of days has a 40% chance of that happening here right now. But what we're really going to be watching is the additional rainfall that's going to work across some of those areas along the Gulf Coast in the coming days. Today being one of those days, specifically anywhere from the Florida Panhandle to Louisiana is where we're looking at the best chance of some of that heavy rain.  It's still going to be kind of disorganized, so these rain bands will be working in through the day today and even into tomorrow. You can see the central Gulf Coast is the bullseye for the heaviest of the rain and potentially that flash flooding. By the time we get through at least Friday, multiple inches of rain expected to fall across this region.  anywhere from 6 to 8 inches in some localized spots. So we'll watch for the flooding concerns again across this region, at least until the end of our work week as this system works its way to the West, impacting folks along the Gulf Coast. And then on top of that, it's feeling like summer across a good chunk of the country, so much so that we've got some of these heat alerts that have been put up over the past 24 hours. Much of those covering parts of the Northeast, New York, Syracuse, Dover, all included in that.  And then a good chunk of parts of the South as well, from New Orleans up to Memphis, including Shreveport and Jackson, all included in these heat advisories. For now, we're expecting temperatures to head into those low 90s for a lot of folks across parts of the Great Lakes, even New York City, ending up in the upper 90s. But take a look at what happens when you add in that humidity. We've got heat index values topping 100 in Dallas, in Little Rock. 109 is what we're expecting to feel like later this afternoon in Jackson, Charleston, into the triple digits.  New York City feeling like 96 degrees tomorrow. Not much relief unless you live back in the parts of the upper Midwest. We're still going to be into the triple digits for the feels like temperatures across parts of the southeast. It'll actually be 100 degrees for the actual temperature in Little Rock tomorrow. 100 degrees for what it'll feel like in Birmingham.  103 Free Heat Index in Philadelphia. So really warm couple of days ahead. If you're looking for some relief in places like New York City, you're finally going to get it here on Friday. We'll see the system work through. It'll bring us a bit of that relief with temperatures just topping out into those mid-80s for the wrap-up of the week. But then we head into the weekend even better, 83 degrees on Saturday and Sunday. Still quite warm, though, across the southern tier of the country well through our weekend, guys.  All right, wow. A lot going on, but I'm happy the heat's breaking. Yes. It's been rough leaving here. Just a couple of days away. All right, thanks, Andrew. You got it. Weekend and almost there. Great together. Thank you, Angie. Now to Washington, where the crack between the Trump administration and congressional Republicans is widening over the DOJ's handling of the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. As NBC News Chief Justice and National Affairs correspondent Kelly O'Donnell explains, now the top Republican on Capitol Hill is demanding the Epstein files be released.  The MAGA movement's push for public disclosure of the Justice Department's files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein now includes a high-profile Trump ally. I'm for transparency. House Speaker Mike Johnson. It's a very delicate subject, but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it.  A push for damage control from the president's own daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. I do think that there needs to be more transparency on this. And I think that that will happen. Attorney General Pam Bondi tried to deflect Epstein questions. Nothing about Epstein. I'm not going to talk about Epstein. Reporters pressed her on new comments from President Trump, suggesting Bondi consider opening some files.  She's handled it very well, and it's going to be up to her. Whatever she thinks is credible, she should release. The president said today you would release credible files related to Mr. Epstein. Are you prepared to do that, and when would you do that?

This is kind of the last position that President Trump has to fill to really round out his cabinet. And Mike Waltz was part of a panel with other nominees, which is why his hearing format was a little bit strange. It actually took more than an hour for Democrats to actually bring up the signal gate. It wasn't just Chris Coons. It was also  Tim Kaine and other Democrats that just went back and forth with Waltz, continuing to press him on whether classified sensitive information was shared during that signal chat that Waltz accidentally added a reporter to back in the spring. That is the catalyst for which led the president to remove Waltz from this position and instead nominate him for UN ambassador. So most of the hearing did focus on those issues concerning that post, especially the US approach to China.  Israel, and of course how the UN handled its aid work around the world.

Now let's get to an update on the Minnesota lawmakers targeted by a gunman last month in what's been called a political assassination. A federal grand jury indicted 57-year-old Vance Belter yesterday on six charges. They are tied to the stalking and murder of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as the stalking and shooting of state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, and the attempted shooting of their daughter. The charges could carry the death penalty.  Prosecutors also revealed a letter they say was found in Belter's car. It is addressed to FBI Director Kash Patel. In it, Belter allegedly confessed to the shootings and claimed that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz had instructed him to kill two U.S. senators. There is no evidence that Belter targeted either of Minnesota's U.S. senators, Amy Klobuchar or Tina Smith, and he has not yet entered a plea.  There were dramatic opening statements kicked off yesterday in the murder trial of a Colorado dentist accused of using poison to kill his wife of 23 years. Prosecutors allege that Dr. James Craig killed his wife Angela by mixing arsenic and cyanide into her protein shakes. With the trial now underway in a suburb of Denver, the defense claiming that while Craig may not have been the best husband, he's not a murderer.  In a Colorado courtroom, prosecutors accused Dr. James Craig of poisoning his wife Angela's protein shakes in 2023 and said a motive, while not necessary, was there.  and a slew of other charges. His defense acknowledging the financial woes and saying his wife, a mother of six, contributed to them. Also revealing Craig's decades of extramarital relationships, but arguing that doesn't make someone guilty of murder."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 974.952, "text": "You may not think he's a good husband, but that's not what you're here to decide.

With an affidavit laying out Craig's purchase of arsenic on Amazon and his online searches, how many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human? And is arsenic detectable in autopsy? The court document also alleging he searched YouTube around that time for top five undetectable poisons that show no signs of foul play and how to make poison.  How important do you think the digital evidence in this case is going to be? The most important. It's going to come down to this narrative, which is told with the digital evidence, which is irrefutable. Prosecutors say while Angela received hospital treatment over a 10 day stretch, Craig ordered cyanide to his office and then visited her. The defense countering the evidence is all circumstantial in a case sure to spark strong emotions beyond Colorado.  So some more information here. The autopsy released by the coroner's office listed Angela's cause of death as acute cyanide poisoning with ingredients from over-the-counter eye drops, as well as subacute arsenic poisoning. Now, the defense did not deny in opening statements that he bought those poisons or that Craig researched them exhaustively, but is disputing how they ended up in Angela's body.  lot of questions there. Well, we are learning more details this morning about the fatal shooting of a key executive from the longtime reality TV show American Idol, along with her husband, inside their Los Angeles home this week. A 22-year-old man has now been arrested in connection with the double homicide. NBC News correspondent Camila Bernal has the latest.  A welfare check leading police to a trail of blood. Three law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation say officers sent to check on residents at this Los Angeles home found blood and then broke in through a glass door on Monday afternoon. Discovering a man and a woman dead inside. NBC News confirms the victims are American Idol music supervisor Robin Kay and her husband Thomas DeLuca, both age 70.  The couple found in separate rooms. Both appeared to have been shot in the upper body, according to the law enforcement sources, who say they found Kay in the home's pantry and her husband in the bathroom. Police were called to that same house last Thursday after reports of a prowler.

Well, the victim's pool cleaner told our NBC Los Angeles station that burglaries have been happening more frequently in that neighborhood. Very disconcerting. Much more here to come on Morning News now. Later this hour, concert chaos. Several fans injured in a stampede after Beyonce's Cowboy Carter show in Atlanta. What we're learning from witnesses. Up first, though, after the break, President Trump sending a warning to Ukraine days after a major weapons deal. The latest next.  We're back with the latest in the Russia-Ukraine war, where President Trump is urging Ukraine not to attack Moscow. His comments refute an earlier report. This was in the Financial Times. It said that the president had privately encouraged Ukrainian President Zelensky to hit the Russian capital. Speaking yesterday, the president also warned Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine within 50 days or face further financial penalties.  Well, at the end of 50 days, if we don't have a deal, it's going to be too bad. Should Zelensky get more aggressive? Yeah, the tariffs are going to go on and other sanctions go on. Should Zelensky target Moscow? Should Zelensky target Moscow, sir? Should Zelensky target Moscow or deeper into Russia? No, he shouldn't target Moscow.  NBC News Chief International Correspondent Keir Simmons joins us now from Moscow. Keir, good morning. So there he just said it, no, when asked if Ukraine should strike Moscow. What more does the White House have to say at this point about that report and the financial times that I mentioned?  Well, you know, from here in Moscow, it kind of looks like mixed messages. You heard there our own Gabe Gutierrez questioning President Trump and getting that answer that Zelensky should not target Moscow. But that, of course, came after that Financial Times report citing two sources that said that he had asked the question in the conversation with President Zelensky whether long-range weapons could hit Moscow here and also St. Petersburg here.  in Russia, and then there was a White House clarification that said that he had raised the question, but that he hadn't said it in the sense of encouraging that, that he hadn't been calling for more killing, if you like. Then you have that comment that you just played there.  There are questions, I think, here about exactly what, and this is what's being said publicly by Russian ministers, there are questions about exactly what the White House wants, and questions many ministers around President Putin questioning the ceasefire ultimatum, the deadline, and saying that Russia does not comply with deadlines like that, and this is what, for example, the foreign minister says, they don't understand it.  Hey, Kir, what's been the reaction there to this 50-day ultimatum by President Trump for Russia to agree to this peace deal with Ukraine or face these tariffs? Yeah, I mean, that's what I mentioned that the foreign minister was referring to.  Look, here's the point about this. In the end, what really matters is one man's view, the man inside the Kremlin there behind me, President Putin. And now he is on a trip east of Moscow here visiting factories. That might be an opportunity for him to respond for the first time. So we have heard, as I mentioned, Minister Lavrov, the foreign minister, we have heard from the deputy foreign minister saying we don't respond to ultimatums. We've heard just in the past few hours the Kremlin spokesman  saying that they note President Trump's disappointment but that President Trump should also be putting pressure on Ukraine. I would say all of these things are holding patterns until we understand what President Putin thinks, what he's going to say publicly. We do know this about him though, he's not the kind of man who yields easily to pressure.  here I also want to ask well we've got you about this this plan for weapons for Ukraine where NATO countries they buy this US Patriot missile systems and then pass them along to Ukraine kind of like a middleman here some of these countries say they need more details on how exactly this is all going to work it does sound a little confusing what can you tell us about it  Yeah, well, President Trump, just in his latest comments, and it's interesting, isn't it? He's been talking a lot. President Putin back there in the Kremlin. Well, he's not in the Kremlin right now, but, you know, that's his office, obviously. We haven't heard from him. Quite a contrast. President Trump has been saying that the Patriot air defense systems are on their way to Ukraine, that they're coming from Germany. You're right. The Europeans are asking questions about the detail. The Europeans often complain about not being included, not being fully looped in, if you like.  I suspect that that's because President Trump is making the decisions and that he leaves the details to be figured out later. The question, of course, inevitably, particularly from the Ukrainians, will be, is this the final stance of the White House or will we see another shift, particularly because of the domestic politics?  there around this new approach to Ukraine. It's interesting, President Zelensky again praising the White House, saying in a statement that the Russians only respond to force.  Keir Simmons, thank you very much. Well, in the first few months of the second Trump administration, Americans' attitude toward immigration is experiencing a dramatic shift. This is from a new Gallup poll. It shows that a record 79% of people consider it good for the country. And it comes as more people are starting to disapprove of the way the president is handling immigration.  His latest decision to build this massive detention center in the Florida Everglades. It's been coined Alligator Alcatraz. It's been another flashpoint. Reporter Ari Odzer from NBC Miami spoke to an archbishop who says the center is inhumane.  Built by the state of Florida on land owned by Miami-Dade County, the facility made of tents and temporary structures has become a flashpoint, a symbol of the Trump detention and deportation policy. No, we should not make fun of other people's misery.  The archbishop says the nickname Alligator Alcatraz is crass and demeaning in itself.

NBC6 political analyst Alex Pinellas says the issue has more impact nationally than locally. Because we all want to make America great again, but you're not going to make America great by making America mean. Our thanks to Ari Adzer for that report. Well, coming up, a shared struggle from millions of women. I was seeing a G.O.A. and I was just like, no, you're fine. You're fine. I'm like, no, I'm not. Something's not right.  When we come back, the renewed push to understand perimenopause and new research also shows how a good workout can help you get better sleep. We've got that in your weekly checkup up next here on Morning News Now.  We are back now with our weekly medical checkup, and we've got some new tips on how to reduce side effects and stay healthy if you're using those popular weight loss drug medications. Plus, if you're having trouble sleeping, researchers say certain workouts could be just what you need. It's an interesting one. NBC News medical contributor Dr. Vin Gupta joins us to break it all down. Dr. Gupta, always great to see you. Good morning. So let's start on these weight loss drugs and these side effects that come with them, because so many people are on these.  It can make it difficult for people, though, to want to stay on them or be able to stay on them. We have this new article. It's got tips for minimizing symptoms and maximizing benefits. What advice did this article give?  And Savannah, exactly to your point, a lot of people start, but about 50% don't go from dose one to dose two. So there's a lot of drop-off because of these side effects. And so this article suggested there's a few things we can do. One, protein loss is a big deal when it comes to being on these medications. We lose muscle mass. And so it's important to make sure your meals throughout the course of the day have about 20 to 30 grams of protein. So that's a serving of,  of, say, lean meat or tofu at least once a day on that plate. Dehydration is common, so 8 to 12 cups of water. That's filling your water bottle up once or at least twice a day to maintain hydration. And then, you know, sitting up after meals and making sure critically that you're active. Activity helps with digestion, helps with issues like GI side effects, which are common.  with these medications. So from a doctor's orders perspectives, maintain the changes that you will adopt while you're taking these medications. People do do lifestyle changes while they're on these medications. Maintain them and then track your progress.  Really good advice there. All right, let's look at this new study. It shows that all kinds of ways to help with insomnia. Of course, people have tried so many things, you know, therapy, acupuncture, medications. But this study found that simple workouts could actually be super effective here. What did it find? Are there certain types of exercises? And why does it seem that it helps with sleeping?  You know, this found that Tai Chi and yoga were actually the most effective, even 30 minutes a day, at promoting deeper sleep, Savannah. And so, you know, we all want to sleep deep. We all want to go to bed at night and wake up in the morning and not have sleep disturbances. And Tai Chi,  and yoga, and there was something about those specific exercises, deep breathing, just maybe the meditative aspects of it, actually helped promote deeper sleep throughout the night. Jogging was good as well, so any activity frankly was great during the day, but Tai Chi and yoga were especially effective and improved sleep quality and duration by almost two hours. And so, you know, really from a doctor's orders perspective, you want to do controlled breathing throughout the day,  or at least for parts of the day when you can carve out time for some version of exercise. But Tai Chi and yoga, not exactly aerobic activity, but got the job done. And controlled breathing, really, really important in addition to utilizing exercise from a doctor's or nurse's perspective.  All right, there you go. All right, finally, this last one, new research. It shows that playing a musical instrument could help protect your brain as you age. I feel like anything that kind of keeps you really thinking and has that, like, mind-hand connection might be good. But what are researchers saying about how music and maybe even taking up an instrument as you age might keep our minds sharp?  Yeah, very interesting research here, suggesting that as we get older, those that are musicians, they're actually compared MRI, functional MRI findings of our brain. So basically, how many parts of our brain are actually  and doing something, that's really what these functional MRIs can tell us amongst older musicians that are playing an instrument versus older people that are not playing an instrument. And frankly, Savannah had found out that more parts of our brain are lighting up and are active if we're playing an instrument as we age. And so it's never too late, doctor's orders here, it's never too late to pick up an instrument and try something new. But that really, I think the top line here, and we've talked about this through the years,  If you're engaging your mind, whether it's playing an instrument, staying active, reading, engaging your mind, engaging your community around you, those things really keep you young, and that's what's helpful to deter, say, cognitive decline. We'll have a story coming up that I just did, where even playing video games, doctors say, is good for the brain as you age. Again, kind of like using those different parts of the brain, keeping cognition going. Dr. Gupta, great to see you. Thank you very much.  Well, over the years, menopause has become less and less of a taboo topic, with more women speaking out about their experiences. Here's the thing, though. For many, it's actually the years leading up to menopause. That period, it's called perimenopause, and that can bring so much confusion and frustration.

After suffering through a wide range of symptoms with little relief, they turned to Dr. Erica Schwartz for advice and found help through a combination of supplements and hormone therapy.

One possible solution, new laws to help women get the care they need. Unfortunately, government often lags behind what's going on in society. New York Assembly member Linda B. Rosenthal has been an advocate for women's health for nearly 20 years. She sponsored two bills, fighting for perimenopause and menopausal insurance coverage, protections at work, and increased education and awareness.  Menopause has often been shrouded in shame and stigma. It's invisible, as are women of menopausal age often, invisible in society. I feel responsible for trying to change that particular aspect of it.  Across the country, at least 16 states have introduced legislation focused on everything from increased support and insurance coverage to access to treatments and furthering education for physicians around perimenopause and menopause. If women don't have this support, they'll continue to suffer in medical ways and psychological ways. And the aim of all of this is to empower women, let them go boldly into the next chapter with as much support as they need. You think it's important for this legislation to get passed?  Absolutely.

Priscilla Thompson, NBC News. All right, we're going to turn now to some money headlines. President Trump says those sweeping White House tariffs may hit big pharma in the coming weeks. That's right. It's NBC's Silvana Henao has that and other money news. Hey, Silvana, good morning. Hey, Sam. Hey, Sam. Good morning to you. Yes, so President Trump says he's likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports as soon as August 1st.  and on semiconductor chips as well. Now, he says the drug tariffs would start off at a low rate and build, and that's to get companies a year or so to shift or build operations in the U.S. Now, any tariffs could have an immediate impact on U.S. companies such as Merck, Eli Lilly, and Pfizer that produce drugs overseas, and foreign companies like Nova Nordisk, which makes the active ingredient for its weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wigovy in Denmark.  Meanwhile, the White House is finalizing an executive order to allow 401k retirement accounts to invest in private equity. Now, the Wall Street Journal says that this would ease legal concerns that have largely kept alternative investments out of retirement plans. It would also be a major win for the industry, which has been trying to secure a piece of the roughly $12 trillion held in 401ks.  Now, supporters say opening funds to private equity would offer savers more investment options, but others say it would also come with greater risks and higher fees.

The awards will be handed out September 14th. Mark Barger, NBC News. Let's stay on this. For more, let's bring in entertainment journalist, pop culture expert, our friend, Brian Balthazar. Brian, thank you so much for joining us today. Okay, let's start with the frontrunners this year. We just heard some of this. Severance leading the pack, 27 nominations for its second season. And then that was followed closely by HBO Max's The Penguin, that had 24. Tell us about the frontrunners and any other big names this year.  Well, you just hit on the two top ones. And then, of course, the White Lotus really just has, like, an attraction all of its own. You know, it's interesting when you have a series that has a different storyline, you know, certain common threads. But a different storyline every season to always kind of start to dominate like this is really impressive. And then the studio, Hollywood loves to talk about itself, let's be honest, and analyze its own industry. So I think these top choices are actually pretty impressive. But also, I think what's interesting is what we're learning from the nominees as a whole is,  The voters and the people doing these nominations love new, new talent, new shows, new roles. And I think we're seeing that especially in the new shows that have been nominated. You see The Studio, which was one of them that we just spoke about. The Pit on HBO Max with Noah Wiley, again, a new show that's gotten a lot of attention. And everyone was talking about adolescents this year on Netflix, of course.  course incredible production techniques to to make that show really unique and still a really gripping story. So freshman shows are really getting a lot of attention and the same could be said for the actors in them. I mean white Lotus.  White Lotus, for sure. By the way, adolescence, when I watched that, you're on the edge of your seat the entire time. Just sort of the, like, editorial decision to shoot this all in, like, one take for, like, 40 minutes. Even, like, a show like this was such an underlying message, too. It was so relevant. The depth of the characters, and specifically this young boy, was just incredible. Brian, can we talk about some of the new nominees in terms of actors? I mean, this is hard to believe, but Harrison Ford just received his first Emmy nomination ever.  Isn't that incredible? But this is a role where he really could sink his teeth into it on shrinking on Apple TV. A lot of first timers, Kristen Bell and Adam Brody for Nobody Wants This. Obviously some of the people from White Lotus as well. I think we have a graphic. The list goes on. Oh, also an interesting one. Kathy Bates getting her first Emmy nomination at age 77 for Matlock. So there's a lot of great surprises when you see these first time nominees.  For every person that gets nominated, there's someone who gets shoved off the list. And I don't like to talk about snubs, but I do like to talk about them when it means that we're heralding great work that unfortunately, in this case, did not get recognized. And there were quite a few of those. Also, Amy Lou Wood, right? From the White Lotus.  would again from White Lotus, a great performance there.

It all comes as millions across the country are bracing for scorching, humid conditions in the coming days. And then the Northeast is recovering from those major deadly storms here earlier this week. We're going to have the full forecast, of course, in just a moment. But first, let's go to NBC News correspondent Shaquille Brewster. He's in Minneapolis. Hi, Shaq. Good morning.  Good morning, and you hear it, you see it. It is coming down here in Minneapolis. Part of this system that's moving through the Midwest, that's brought heavy rain and some thunderstorms to the area. Overnight, we were focused on pockets of Virginia, where you saw flooding and flood alerts and heavy rain there as well, as we learned that that flooding from earlier this week in the Northeast has now turned deadly.  This morning, after a day of wild rain and rising water, Americans now bracing for extreme heat. It could get brutal out here. With almost 70 million under heat alerts across the country, with many in the Northeast expecting sweltering temps, some areas could feel as hot as 105 degrees this week.  But it also comes as some are bracing for even more flooding, with heavy rains overnight in the Midwest and Northeast. I have a rain gauge there, and I've never seen it fill up that fast. While the aftermath of severe flooding that swept through the tri-state area, seen from above, following inch after inch of intense rain that saturated communities.

Now, this rain that you're seeing is helping to push out some of that Canadian wildfire smoke that brought those hazy skies to cities like Minneapolis and Chicago. It also is helping to cool things down. Yesterday, there was a heat alert here in Minnesota. That is now gone. We're expecting some cooler temperatures. But as you saw in that piece there, you're going to have that heat and humidity headed directly to where you are now. Back to you. Oh, love to hear that. Jack, thank you very much.  I realize weather whiplash is a cliche thing to say, but that truly is what we're seeing. Intense heat, as Jack just mentioned, and humidity now expected in parts of the Midwest. Again, the mid-Atlantic and the Southeast. Yeah, Angie Lassman's here in studio tracking all this for us. Hey, Angie, good morning. Hi, guys. Good morning to you. Weather whiplash for sure. We've got some summer-like temperatures across much of the East. 67 million people are under these heat alerts. Most of those alerts are up for parts of the Northeast and parts of the South, but you can see Memphis to New Orleans and Dover stretching up through New York and out towards Syracuse are included in those alerts.  All that means it's going to be hot today. You're going to want to be able to find a cool spot. Taking a frequent breaks if you have to extend spend extended time outdoors today, really across much of much of the East Coast and stretching back into the Ohio Valley and even parts of the plains. We've got 95 on tap for Dallas today. 101 is what it'll feel like. It'll feel like the high 90s in Chicago, 97 for your heat index in Roanoke today and into the mid to upper 90s for what it'll feel like across the tri-state area as well.  109 for your feels like in Jackson. So you get the picture. It's going to be warm. It's going to be humid and that goes on for tomorrow too. Will watch for this cold front to bring a little bit of a break to folks across parts of the Midwest. Not so much for the South for tomorrow. Will still be well into those 90s and into the triple digits in Little Rock. Our feels like temperatures will be elevated as well.  By the time the weekend rolls around, it'll be cooler across the North. So you see that 78 in Chicago on Friday. We're back to the mid 80s by Saturday. Milder across New York as well with temperatures into those low 80s for your Saturday and Sunday plans. But not much relief for our friends in Wilmington, Atlanta, or Little Rock. We'll be well into the 90s in all of those locations through the weekend.  Meanwhile, you heard Shaq say there's a little bit of rain that was working through parts of the Midwest, and that's because of that cold front that is going to offer up some relief, but bringing the potential for severe weather to parts of Wisconsin and Illinois today. And then as we get into tomorrow, some of those storms will work towards the East Coast and stretch back to the  and that means more of that localized flash flooding will be possible. Today, though, the severe weather risk centered across the Rockies and parts of the Midwest, Chicago, Green Bay, Milwaukee, Denver, all included in that. It looks like the hail and the wind gusts will be the main threats today, guys, into the afternoon and evening hours, but we, of course, can't rule out an isolated tornado or two. And on top of that, we're tracking the tropical system that's down towards the south and leaving us with some heavy rain across the Gulf Coast.  Just one of those. Just one of those.

President Trump is now saying that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release any files deemed to be credible. This comes as some of Mr. Trump's biggest supporters are calling for them to be made public. NBC News senior White House correspondent Gabe Gutierrez joins us from Washington with the latest on this one. Hey, Gabe, good morning.  Hey, there's Savannah. Good morning. It is a dramatic fracture within the MAGA movement, which has always been loyal to President Trump. Overnight, new high-profile voices weighing in. And so will the files be released?

This story, by the way, just continues to escalate. For more on this, let's bring in NBC News senior national politics reporter Jonathan Allen. He's also the co-author of the New York Times bestseller, Fight Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House. Jonathan, good morning. Thank you for joining us. We just heard in Gabe's piece that Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is calling the fallout over the Epstein files, quote,  The first fracture in MAGA. Can you contextualize this for us, Jonathan? Why is this the subject matter that's sort of breaking the straw on the camel's back when it comes to fractures within MAGA? Good morning, guys. I think the reason that so many people are looking at this as unique is that the MAGA base has largely been distrustful of government, distrustful of  institutions. And the promise of Donald Trump to his supporters, to that MAGA base, has been that he was going to take a sledgehammer to the powerful and to the elite. And I know that there are people outside the MAGA base who have always been very skeptical of that and been able to point to things where that wasn't true. But within the MAGA base, this has been a key belief for a long time, that the Jeffrey Epstein story was one that  you know, that really resonated. And now they're looking at the Trump administration and saying, you know, why wouldn't you release everything? Why wouldn't, you know, why are you trying to cover up for the powerful? And so this has been a tough one for the MAGA base. And it comes against the backdrop also of some other things where there's  You know, that coalition is being tested, whether it's the situation in Israel and Gaza or the Ukrainian defense against Russia. So, you know, you're seeing the strains of governance and when the president makes decisions and they don't sit well with his base. John, we played a little bit of this, but I want to play more of what the president said. This was just yesterday. We'll talk on the other side.  I would say that, you know, these files were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by the Biden, you know, and we went through years of that with the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, with all of the different things that we had to go through. We've gone through years of it.  He also said he doesn't understand why his supporters are interested in the Epstein case, but obviously he's facing immense pressure about these files not being released at this point. I'm wondering how you see this playing out, and is kind of the idea of pointing to Pam Bondi and saying, whatever you think is credible, go ahead and release. Is it kind of just pushing it off to someone else who already is taking a lot of heat for this?  I mean, it's absurd, at some level, the president saying that Pam Bondi should release whatever she thinks is credible. He has shown, if nothing else, that he demands loyalty from the people that work for him. So she works for him. Right. Yeah, I mean, it just seems absurd, or at least  I understand it politically. I mean, he's distancing himself from it as much as possible and certainly saying publicly she should release things. And obviously, you know, he's not giving the same instruction privately. All of that said, I mean, you know, I think his argument that Jim Comey and Barack Obama and Joe Biden  effectively made things up and put them in the Epstein file is belied by the fact that the Democrats did not leak anything from the Epstein file in 2016 when Trump was running, or 2020 when Trump was running, or 2024 when Trump was running. What do you make of that? And also, let's talk about the Democrats. They've criticized the Trump administration and its handling of the Epstein case. How unified are they on this issue, and why do you think it is, Jonathan, that nothing is leaked up to this point?  Well, I think the Democrats are very unified on this issue because they see an opportunity to divide the Republicans. And, you know, it's certainly the case where I think most of those Democrats are, you know, a little bit tongue in cheek or, you know, a little bit, you know,  Winking and nodding at each other because they don't think there's anything in the Epstein files that's actually harmful to any of the politicians, you know, at least in terms of, I mean, nobody, nobody has come forward with any allegation that Donald Trump or any other high ranking politician was part of a child sex trafficking ring with.  you know, with Jeffrey Epstein. So I think the Democrats are exploiting a political opportunity here in the way that they think the Republicans have done with, you know, wild conspiracy theories in the past. Yeah, kind of interesting to just stand back and watch the show, so to speak. Thank you, Jonathan.  Well, President Trump has said Ukraine should not target Moscow if it gets long-range weapons. The president made the comments after a report in the Financial Times claimed he had privately encouraged President Zelensky to strike the Russian capital. NBC News Chief International Correspondent Keir Simmons joins us from Moscow on this hike. Keir, good morning.  And there is still no response in public from President Putin to that ceasefire ultimatum from President Trump. Russian ministers have been saying that they do not accept the deadline.

Meanwhile, President Zelensky again praising the White House for its new approach to Ukraine, saying Russia only understands force.  This morning, as Ukrainian firefighters battle the aftermath of another Russian airstrike, President Trump says he hasn't spoken with President Putin. He says he wants peace. He does. So far, it's all talk and no action. Since setting his 50-day deadline, aiming to force the Russian leader to compromise. A lot of opinions change very rapidly. Might not be 50 days.

Authorities believe he was able to get into the house through an unlocked door, killing that couple after a confrontation. And now police saying this could have been a random attack.  This morning, police in Los Angeles are trying to determine why someone would murder a beloved American Idol executive and her husband. Friends and family had not seen Robin Kaye and Thomas DeLuca for days. Police were called to their Encino home for a welfare check on Monday and made their way in after discovering a trail of blood at the couple's front door. Inside, they found the husband and wife murdered in their own home. We are, like, shocked. We're really shocked.  Law enforcement sources telling NBC News, Kay and DeLuca, both 70, were found shot to death and were likely dead since at least last Thursday. But the sources say there were no signs of forced entry. Overnight, police announcing they arrested 22-year-old Raymond Budarian.

There's much more to come on this hour of Morning News now, including the latest numbers on inflation and where Americans are shelling out more cash in the wake of President Trump's tariff tirade. But first, after the break, the Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife by poisoning her protein shakes. We've got all the latest details from court next.  We're back now with the opening statements and the trial of Dr. James Craig. He's a Colorado dentist accused of fatally poisoning his wife with drugs that included cyanide and arsenic. Now, Craig's defense team arguing he may not have been the perfect husband, but they say he's no murderer. In a chilling sequence of courtroom accusations, Colorado prosecutors making their case against Dr. James Craig. He went in that room.  potentially end her life with a fatal dose of something.  Opening statements of the murder trial coming more than two years after his wife Angela, the mother of their six children, died after fighting a mysterious illness. Prosecutors telling the jury Craig used drugs like cyanide and arsenic to poison her protein shakes. According to legal documents, Craig conducted explicit internet searches on his work computer in the days before and during his wife's health struggles, including how many grams of pure arsenic will kill a human,  and is arsenic detectable in autopsy. Prosecutors say he also looked on YouTube for top five undetectable poisons that show no signs of foul play. Craig has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and a slew of other charges.

This is not hungry, Craig allegedly asks. Nauseous?  No, Angela responded, I feel drugged. The autopsy released by the coroner's office here listed Angela's cause of death as acute cyanide poisoning with ingredients from over-the-counter eye drops as well, and then subacute arsenic poisoning. The defense is not denying that Craig bought those poisons or that he researched them exhaustively, but maintains he did not murder his wife.  All right, we are also following developing news this morning. This is out of Gaza, where an aid group says several Palestinians were killed in a crowd surge at an aid distribution site. We have NBC News international correspondent Claudio La Vanga joining us from Rome with more on that and other world news in 60 seconds. Claudio, good morning.  Good morning. Well, that's right. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has said that early on Wednesday morning, at least 20 people have died in what they say was a tragic accident. Now, in a statement, the foundation, which is backed by Israel and the U.S., said, and I quote, that 19 of the victims were trampled and one was stabbed amid a chaotic and dangerous surge deliberately fomented by armed agitators affiliated with Hamas, a claim Hamas denies.  Let's go now to London, where on Tuesday the British government revealed that thousands of Afghans, including many who worked with British forces in Afghanistan, were secretly resettled in the UK after a spreadsheet containing their details was accidentally released in 2022 because of a defence official's email error, which was only recently discovered.  And let's end this tour of the world in Pompeii, where an ancient Roman erotic mosaic was returned home 80 years after it was stolen by a Nazi officer stationed in Italy during World War II. The mosaic, which is more than 2,000 years old, features what appears to be two lovers engaging in, well, an intimate moment. Back to you guys.  Well, thanks for those details, Claudio. I have so many questions, I don't even know where to start, so I'm not going to... I am a big Pompeii nerd. I don't know if you knew about that. I can't answer them. Thank you, Claudio, for joining us on that. Up next, inflation is unfortunately back in the spotlight this morning. That's right. After the break, we're going to dig into a new government report revealing where price tags are actually ticking up in the wake of all those Trump administration tariffs on U.S. allies.

In a recent survey of online shoppers, more than 30% of respondents delayed purchases due to uncertainty over prices.  A new Federal Trade Commission rule went into effect back in May, cracking down on tactics used to hide total prices from consumers, like adding hidden fees.

And for years, vaccine skeptics have spoken out about the use of aluminum in immunizations, blaming it for a string of serious conditions. Yeah, but this week, a new international study has revealed that there is no link between aluminum and vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including asthma and autism.  Lots to dig into here. NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel joining us now with more details from this study. Dr. Patel, good morning. Let's start with the reason that aluminum is now being used in vaccines to begin with and why is it needed?  Yeah, let's cover the basics. Why do we even have it and which vaccines have it? So aluminum salts, which is what we're talking about, are specifically used to help recognize the antigen. When you give someone a vaccine and you give a shot, it helps the body recognize and say, hey, here's an antigen, start developing an immune reaction so that in the future you can cover and prevent that disease. It's really meant to help you use less dosing and fewer shots. So overall a good thing. And then let's talk about what it's not. It's not in every vaccine.  It's in very specific vaccines, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, hepatitis, haemophilus, influenza. It's not in some of the live viral vaccines that have been topics of headlines lately, salmon, savannah, like measles, mumps, and rubella. Dr. Patel, so researchers, let's talk about this, there's more than a million people here in Denmark for this study. What were the biggest takeaways?  Biggest takeaways, because this is one of the largest observational studies, so let's just be clear about the method. They really just observed over 20 years, over 1.2 million children, and then followed them about eight years after they had had their vaccine. So this is a long observational study, decades long, and it can really look at different age cohorts, different, as you mentioned, 50 chronic  conditions and then anything else that you didn't intend to measure, they can also take note of that because they follow the children for so long and they saw no increase or no association with vaccines and aluminum and aluminum exposure and any of the chronic conditions. And so this isn't a perfect study, but it is the largest one we have and it does exceed all the evidence we have in the United States. Dr. Patel, as a doctor, what is your message to parents or to adults who are concerned about children receiving vaccines with aluminum in them?  I think most important thing, Sam, is just what we covered, what they are. These are not the aluminum metals. I think people just think of aluminum as equivalent. These are aluminum salts that are not even captured kind of in the blood that you would measure after a vaccine. And so I try to just reassure what it is and what it isn't. I also do some comparators.  over the first six months, which is when you have a lot of vaccines for kids, four milligrams of aluminum is probably the cumulative dose. Compared to that in breastfeeding, you get about seven milligrams of aluminum. So this is something that we see. And then I also stress, follow the schedule, talk to your pediatrician, talk to me, your primary care doctor, and then think about the diseases you're preventing. I ticked off a number of them.  that are pretty important, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, the detriments and the devastation from those diseases far outweigh and exceed anything that we might see. And again, this Danish study shows that we haven't seen anything yet that we would report to parents to be concerned about. So important, and it's such a conversation right now too. I've been seeing a lot of this on TikTok kind of rearing its head again.

Kennedy Jr. was the closest thing America had to a prince.  From playing in the Oval Office, to the poignant salute at his father's funeral, his life was documented from the moment he was born. My family photo album in my head is shared by a lot of people. It's an unusual sort of connection to have with other folk. How was the honeymoon, John? Carolyn Bessette was the woman who captured his heart, a publicist at Calvin Klein, raised in Connecticut.  Together, they were one of the most famous couples of their time. Everybody wanted to be like them and everybody wanted to be with them. There is just something about them that classic never goes out of style.

Jack Seynard is the Vice President of International Design at Steve Madden. He started an Instagram account devoted to Carolyn a decade ago. John has been famous since the day he was born. What I think has happened over the last couple of years is that the focus and the spotlight really is shifting over to who is this woman who was the wife behind this incredibly storied man. Why do you think people are obsessed with her now?  There was always this very, very strong line of simplicity and elegance that I think people are gravitating towards now because it feels attainable, feels like something that we could all do. The intrigue extends beyond social media with a book documenting Carolyn's fashion released in 2023.  And next year, a highly anticipated TV series from Ryan Murphy about the famous couple on FX. But when first look images and video were released last month... Respectfully, what the hell is this? This coat looks so unbelievably flimsy. Fans voiced their outrage over the clothing choices and hairstyle for the actor portraying Carolyn.  When there's only 100 or so photos of a historical figure, I think, especially for those of us who are zoned in on it, those images are almost photographic memory. You don't have to be a fashion expert to know that it was off.  Murphy and FX have not responded to NBC's request for comment, but Murphy did tell Variety the outfits were just for test shots and that he had a style advisory board to help with Carolyn's wardrobe. What do you think they would have made of all of this? John would have rolled his eyes and said, oh, brother. And Carolyn, I think, would have been flattered and tickled.  Rosemary called Carolyn her fairy godmother of fashion. Her fashion fairy godmother. She actually had a few coats belonging to Carolyn that she just happened to have that Carolyn had given her guys. And last year, they went up for auction. Those coats went for double what the estimates were. Wow. So there is this, like, fascination with them. OK, Kate, you're giving Carolyn.

You said that Carolyn sort of drove this fascination with this younger generation, not necessarily JFK Jr. Yeah, it's more when you look at the TikToks and the Instagrams now, it's all about her, which is interesting, because in life, obviously, it was probably more about him and she was the wife, but now she's getting a little bit of her due, maybe. Yeah. Kate, thank you so much.  Let's get you to some money headlines right now. We're kicking things off with a fun topic, credit card debt. CNBC's Savannah Hanau has the latest on some new data that's breaking down Americans' balances and other headlines. Hey, Savannah.  Hey, Savannah. Hey, Sam. Good morning. Well, nearly a quarter of people with credit card debt believe they'll never get out of the hole. A new bank rate survey finds almost half of credit card holders carry a balance month to month, and 60% have been in debt for at least a year. Emergency expenses are the primary cause of this debt, such as medical bills, home or car repairs, and that's followed by daily expenses, such as groceries or childcare, retail purchases, and vacation expenses.  General Motors is expanding production of gas-powered SUVs and trucks and will move the Cadillac Escalade from a factory in Texas to Michigan. GM will also add capacity for the Chevy Silverado and the GMC Sierra at that same Michigan plant.  separately. Stellantis that's the parent company of Chrysler Dodge and Fiat is scrapping its hydrogen fuel cell program and will no longer launch a range of hydrogen powered vehicles this year because it sees no development in the market. And Larry Ellison overtakes Mark Zuckerberg to become the world's second richest person.  Ellison, he's the founder and chairman of Oracle, has an estimated net worth of just over $251 billion. That's according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Oracle stock price has nearly tripled since the end of 2022 and is up more than 90 percent since late April. More than 80 percent of Ellison's wealth is tied up in Oracle stock and options, guys. All right, Savannah, thank you so much. Got it. Well, the English language consists of an ever changing collection of cultural phrases.  It seems like it grows as younger generations, right, add their own unique lexicons, a common thread that can be both binding but also confounding. For Millennials, it was words and phrases like basic, on fleek, salty. But for Gen Z, it includes terms like bet, no cap, and bussin'.  I love it when you drop a good on fleek, Savannah. Now there's Gen Alpha hitting us with the likes of Brain Rot. I don't even know what this is. Skibidi? Not exactly. I'm going to need a fact check on that. There's some overlap between Gen Z and Gen Alpha, but all the slang has one thing in common. It sprang up on social media.  Why did we decide this was a good idea for us? We didn't. Content creator and linguist Adam Alexick is here to hopefully help us make sense of it all. He wrote this new book. It is right here. It is all about the evolution of slang. It's called Algo Speak. It officially went on sale yesterday. You also may recognize him from his fantastic videos online. Adam, great to have you here.  Thank you. For the record, it's pronounced skibbity. See? That's what I meant. I was testing you. I almost actually, I knew that one, so I almost said it. Okay. First, just talk us through how this works. And congrats again on the book. But what was the most surprising thing as you're kind of like going through all this, researching it? I know that like, this is actually from this like intellectual way of thinking about how these things happen with our dialogue. What'd you learn?  Right, we're not just seeing new words, we're seeing a paradigm shift in language right now. All words are now metadata on the algorithm. When I say that, metadata in the past used to be information about content, like hashtags gave you information about a video. Now the word itself, these algorithms are very sophisticated, they can take natural language processing and tell every single word in this video, and it all becomes information about the content. So influencers have to be very careful with the words they're using, and they use words to go viral, they use words to avoid censorship. All this becomes part of language now, and we use it in our daily lives.  How much intentionality is there then from influencers when it comes to taking words and pushing them into the mainstream? And I guess, what are the most popular slang words you're seeing right now? Skippity is still strong, but it's sort of on its way out. Give it another year, maybe it'll be gone. Yeah, we've got to talk about these words. There is definitely a degree of intentionality. Once creators see that a word is trending, they will use that word because they want to capitalize on that trend and go viral themselves. Then the word will continue trending. So we see this positive feedback loop where words are being pushed to the mainstream.  Do we have all these right? I'm not sure these are all right. No, they look good to me. They do? Okay. All right, good. Riz, having great style."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 131, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 5698.722, "text": "Do you have favorites?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 132, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 5699.183, "text": "Like, our producer Sean loves Riz. How do you feel about Riz? I like Riz. Riz has kind of, like, been around for a minute, though, right? Well, it's only been around since 2023. Okay. Well, early 2022, it started trending, and by 2023, it was the Oxford English Dictionary Word of the Year. And that's just an indicator of how fast these words are changing because algorithms are pushing words at a greater speed than before. Just like brain rot, right?  Brain rot was the Oxford English dictionary word of the year for 2024. And that was sort of circulating on 4chan message boards since like the mid 2010s and then really hit the mainstream. For people who may think like this is silly or it just makes them totally lost in a conversation, there is more at play here, right? I mean, this really says a lot about what social media does to the real world, how it sort of, it's not just this thing on your screen. I mean, it impacts how we communicate with each other.  I think language is a proxy for culture, and the conduits of language change are also the conduits of what cultures are affecting us right now. We see a lot of slang coming from fortune. We see a lot of slang coming from African American English. It's very important to pay attention to these things to see where we're going as a society. More importantly, I think we're seeing a lot of slang that's deliberately meant to grab our attention because our attention is being commodified in social media. What is the life cycle of one of these words? Because the way you're describing it, it seems like this is sort of in and out pretty quickly.  Well, famously, scabity still is around. Some of these words, I don't think scabity is going to last. Some of these words do fit a lexical gap. That means they have a place in our language and they probably are around to stay longer. And some of them are fads and will die out like other slang words in the past. What did you, how did you say it? I just appreciate the burn, the subtle burn that just went down here. Yeah. By the end of this segment, I'm going to get a scabity. You're doing great. You're doing fantastic.  What does that one mean? It's a nonsense word, but it can be used as an intensifier. So you could use it like the word very. You could say, skibbity riz, which is very intense riz. It could be good or bad, because you could use skibbity as a negative intensifier as well. But also, you might just use it as an interjection nonsensically. What the skibbity?  consider us extremely well-educated. At least you didn't know the nonsense word. That must make you feel a little better. I know a lot of stuff. Adam, Alex, it's so great to meet you. Congratulations on the new book. Thanks for coming this morning. Thank you so much. All right, up next, what sort of does that small-town sensation has now grown into a global game? When we come back, we'll introduce you to the pair of pals who put ultimate Frisbee on the map and what exactly it is that makes the sport so special. It's next.  So we are going to end this hour with Ultimate Frisbee, or just Ultimate, as it's known to those. That's right, I caught that Frisbee. Play it, paper drop in the process. The sport is now a global game, but it actually got its start in a small town nearby New Jersey. So I got the chance to sit down with two of the original players who spread the sport to talk about what makes Ultimate so special. In three, two, one.  point. At a small park in Maplewood, New Jersey, ultimate frisbee players soak up a sport that unites people all over the world with 5 million athletes in the U.S. and millions more around the globe picking up a disc. Two of the men who played a pivotal role in making that happen are Ed Summers. One of the things I love about this sport is the frisbee itself and the way it floats and flies, the trajectory it takes, I just love that.  and Joe Barbinel."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 133, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 5884.955, "text": "I tell people the first rule is have fun.

Welcome to NewsNation. And by the way, we laugh, but that's how it works these days, right? Oh, well, she didn't say she's not a Mossad agent. Can't prove she's not. That's where we are. And that's why we need NewsNation for where right and left can come to just be reasonable. Inflation is up. And yes, it has something to do with tariffs. And guess what? There are going to be ups and downs in the economy as we figure out what this pricing structure is. And we're all but ignoring it.  Putin responded to our president's threat by bombing the bejesus out of Ukraine. It's going on right now. Thought we were going to have a ceasefire. Hamas is still in power. And they're still holding hostages. And their own people are still paying the horrible price for their actions.  ICE agents are under attack and appear to be attacking communities, removing people who are wanted and needed. But you know what's dominating the dialogue? You know what already made me lose some clicks?  Epstein. I wasn't talking about Epstein soon enough. Epstein is not going away. And it's now a thing for both sides for good and bad reasons. See the game, my brothers and sisters. A new poll out today shows only 3 percent of us are satisfied with the government's handling of the release of the Epstein files.  I don't get, how can anybody be satisfied when nothing has been released? The answer is that Epstein is not just a dead guy who was a pig and a monster. Epstein is a metaphor for a lack of government transparency, especially in this case, what was promised to the MAGA voters. But interestingly, get this, guess who's the most dissatisfied?  and Democrats. Why? Well, they'll claim that they're anti-establishment, especially in their populist fringe. Anti-rich, certainly, as socialists. But they're also anti-Trump. And Epstein is largely known to be a Trump ploy, right? Pun intended. As in akin to the French painting style, trompe l'oeil, which is a way to trick the eye because MAGA people were tricked.  into believing that Epstein would be one thing and it turned out to be another. They're not going to get to live out their Pizzagate fantasies through Epstein disclosure. And the left loves Maga's misery. But I flag another reason that left and right are into Epstein and I don't like it. He has become a wedge issue for anti-Zionism. You know why Epstein and the people around him are being protected? Because he's a Mossad agent. You know why Trump is protecting the information? Because Israel's telling him to.  There's no evidence. There's no proof of that. This is about selling propaganda. The U.S. government is dirty. Israel is behind everything. Nobody can be trusted except the person selling this particular conspiracy theory. Israel is poisonous, behind all of our problems. These are these fringe narratives that are dominating our dialogue. And, interestingly, the extreme on each side is joined in this cause.  It's proof that these populist movements of magnified minorities have devoured the two parties. And they are just about exploiting outrage for profit and advantage, and largely devoid of any constructive answers to any of the problems that they exploit.  Now, that's the left. On the right, Epstein is now a rallying cry for discontent with this administration. It is not wrong for folks to feel betrayed, bamboozled, led astray, run amok, and everything else that Malcolm X said in his famous speech, because the people that Trump surrounded himself with have for years said on tape that if they were given power, they would uncover the truth about Epstein. And this time, it hits different.  We saw Trump get ratioed twice. You know what that is? That's where the number of comments that you have are larger than the likes for a post. They call it being ratioed. And he's been ratioed twice when he tried to back MAGA off the Epstein demands. Today, he even, he went to his go-to.

First, that's not the only thing out there. We have also heard that there are witness interviews, that there is evidence in a whole investigation. Those are the files that need to be released. And if they don't exist, then Pam Bondi should clearly come out and say that none of that exists, and they have released everything they can.  Second, the Justice Department can go to these judges. I mean, suddenly, they have a reverence for the rule of law. I love it. But they can go to the judges and request the lack of redaction. And if it's really the judges, they should come to Congress or in their release and explain that the judges are not allowing them to release certain information. But the onus here is on the president and on the attorney general.  I get the politics of that, but what if it's true that they don't really have them, and it is about these judges? Why not go directly to court, Roe? Why not have standing, see if you have standing to bring suit here for transparency with the judges?  Look, it's an option, if that's really the case. But we need to know if that's the case. I mean, look, Alan Gershwitz is a brilliant lawyer, but he's got one piece of this. He's saying that they're affidavits by accusers. And I have no reason to doubt him. But, as you know, in an investigation like this, there's far more than just affidavits of accusers.  And so the question is, if that's really the roadblock, then come and tell us that, and we'll take the avenue to get it out. I mean, at this point, my view is, whether you believe that there was a massive cover-up and wrongdoing, or whether you believe that all of this is made up, the best thing we need to restore trust is just to get it out there, so the American people can make a decision. Ro Khanna, I appreciate you taking the time, and I appreciate you pushing for the transparency. Thank you for doing so on NewsNation.  Appreciate it, Chris. All right, thank you very much.

And it's good to give you that kind of insight into what's going on. Now, now.  Let's dig into how right Roe is about what is there that the administration should have, okay? Good perspective on this. Law and politics. David Schoen was Epstein's attorney in the weeks leading up to his death, and we had discussed his own curiosity. They had a real good bail application, he believed. Why would Jeffrey Epstein have killed himself then when he was just days away, maybe from getting out?  and conservative journalist, senior fellow of Frontiers of Freedom, and as wired into what's happening with MAGA as you can find, Scottie Nell Hughes with her own take on what matters here and why the discontent is lingering. So first of all, counsel and Scottie, thank you both for being with me, appreciate you.

So anybody that's using that excuse, listen, Chris, this could be easily solved. Like you said in your monologue, opening monologue, just let it all out there. Let the truth rain. Put Kash Patel, put Dan Bongino, put the attorney general out there and have them question why did they make people think that there was something there when they, I guess, even when they were in office knew there wasn't. Let's not forget, Chris, they handed out empty binders  to conservative influencers and said, here, go show the world that we have information. We're going to be transparent. And it was just empty pieces of paper. Why did they get folks to lie for them then?

There are no lists of people who were credibly accused and investigators just dropped the ball.

And I think your guest is right, that I think that those folks have to come forward. I think we're talking about two different points in time. When they said those things, and they claimed to be entertainers or whatever, they didn't know what they were talking about, frankly. They were buying into the common narrative out there that this stuff was there. They were clumsy about it. They shouldn't have done it. And it comes back to bite them. And they should own it. But let me say this.  There's no way on earth, and I know you're right, they won't let the story go for now, President Trump's legacy should depend on anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein. That would be outrageous. There are a lot of great and important things going on in the world, and important whether you think they're great or not. We have to get past this issue one way or another. You're right, it doesn't seem to go away quickly, but we've got to focus on the important issues that drive this country. Oh, I'm 100 percent. I'm not on this. I just keep saying it's not going away.  on  If your ass is in a sling and you've got information that the government may use to go easy on you, you use it then, okay? Not a year or so later when you've been rotting in prison. That's not when it happens. You're a great journalist. You're a great journalist, and I'm not letting you get away with that. You're a great journalist. The parties disagree. Scotty's got, like, bad taste in her mouth right now. David Schoen, thank you very much. Scotty Nell Hughes, I appreciate your insight, as always. It's great to see you both. Thank you for the kind words. Four minutes and 35 seconds. Look, the president...  was right to campaign on transparency. It's just hard to deliver, especially when it comes to the Epstein files. OK, so I want to talk to people about where we're going on this and where it heads next and what really matters. Let's get after it.  Matt Taibbi joins me now, independent journalist, all about transparency. Remember, he was part of the infamous Twitter files, did a good job with that in tough circumstances. So what matters about Epstein? Matt, it's great to see you. Oh, by the way, publisher of Racket News, R-A-C-K-E-T, on Substack. Very good. Very big and robust following. Matt, thank you for joining me. It's good to see you.  To hear everybody owns a piece of Epstein in MAGA World. J.D. Vance said we got to release it during the campaign. Kash Patel, Dan Bongino. And now it's the first time I've ever heard people in the MAGA media saying to Trump, this isn't going to go away. Why?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1124.902, "text": " Well, first of all, it's extremely bad optics when you promise repeatedly to your voters that you're going to deliver files and then you just announce willy nilly that there is nothing there and we're not going to give them to you."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1140.596, "text": "At minimum, that's extremely amateurish PR by this White House. But more importantly, this topic held enormous import for maybe not for MAGA voters, but for MAGA influencers.  Good point. And so for that reason alone, it's going to live on and on and on. I'm with you, Chris. I don't particularly see this issue as being of as grave importance as other things like the continuing wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine and Russiagate and some other things, but it has huge symbolic importance. And for that  that reason it's not going to go away. You know, someone said to me today, you know, first it was the UFOs and it was Kennedy. And now it's this. And, you know, I hadn't thought of it in a lineage like that before, that really everything that they promised to expose that may have been a fringe appetite to begin with,  has not come true. And maybe this is the one where they decide to not let go. But then again, those influencers are helping with this resistance. I mean, to hear Megyn Kelly decide to go after anything Trump related, you know, since she's obviously pledged fealty. But how can they make these people happy if there's really nothing there, Matt?  Well, that's hard to say. I mean, the obvious answer is you got to release this stuff. But the first thing I'd like to point out is I think this is a healthy situation. You have influencers and reporters who politically are on the side of this White House, have promoted this White House, but are heavily criticizing it.  I don't know what the press is for. I would hope that they would do it over other issues, like, you know, the administration promised to, or talked about cutting defense spending, hasn't done that. I don't think that arouses much consternation, but it's a healthy situation to have your own reporters going after you. And look, this is something they promised and they didn't deliver. And that's what the press is for, is to hold people to account.  I'm with you. I'd love the same energy for you and I right now. And I'm segue to it now, but I wish it was much of a national fascination as it is for you and me. This Ukraine moment is huge, what's happening right now. Putin has responded. Matt, by the way, has such deep contextual knowledge of the reporting. You got to check out his sub-stack, his understanding of Russian politics and the Ukrainian situation, top-notch. But Putin hears what Trump says, says, oh, yeah, I hear you.  just crushes Kharkiv in Ukraine. And now Trump has to make the toughest move he's made yet. What do you give Ukraine and how do they use it? And that's why this story, I don't know what he said or what he didn't say about can you hit Moscow, can you not, but how pressing is this moment, Matt, if the United States gives Ukraine the ability to reach out and touch in Moscow and do great damage and they use it?  Well, I think this is the critical issue for the Trump White House. It's the test case as to whether or not they actually have some independence and there's some daylight between them and every regime that's come before them that's been beholden to the Pentagon, to the intelligence community. As opposed to the Epstein issue, which they did not really campaign on, they did campaign on this issue. And this is an incredibly important moment  We were all kind of led to believe that if there was not progress that the United States was going to walk away.  from Ukraine, they have not done that. And if this is continuity with the Biden policies, which are so heavily criticized, well, then what was the point of all of this? And that, as opposed to the Epstein issue, which I think is largely symbolic, this is an incredibly real, incredibly dangerous issue that if there is not movement on soon, is going to become a real political problem for Donald Trump.  Yeah, this guy Dan Rice, I don't know how well you know him. I have him on the show all the time. He's over at the University in Ukraine. He's been a military advisor to Ukraine, United States military, long time. He says, here's what they have to do. And he told me I can say this, so it's OK.  Every time Russia sends in a mid- to long-range missile into Ukraine, that is the only time that the tomahawks or whatever the modality is that we give them is able to be used in exchange. That's a really important precondition. And I hope it makes its way up the chain, and we hear it from the president. Otherwise, who knows where this goes? Matt Taibbi, thank you so much for your insight on what really matters and what shouldn't matter as much.  But it probably matters more right now. Continued success on Substack. I'm there, and I'm with you. Take care. Thanks a lot, Chris. Take care. Good luck to you, too. All right. Four minutes and 30 seconds. So there are a lot of big voices on social media, right? There's one that stands out, especially when it comes to the rise of anti-Semitism, OK? And not just here, but around the world. And it's one of the few examples  of an actor using their platform to be something more. I get why you tell people in Hollywood to shut up. I don't think it applies to comedian Michael Rappaport. And I want him on to talk about what he thinks of this new twist on Epstein. You know, they're protecting him because he's a Mossad guy. Trump's being quiet about it because Israel's telling him to. What does he think of that? Next.  Since October 7th, when Israel was attacked, there's been a nearly 400% increase in anti-Semitic incidents increasing across the country. So much for the Jews controlling the media, right? You know that old myth?  because they are getting killed on social media and, frankly, in much of the coverage in terms of where the needle is. And I've seen who has decided to be quiet and who has decided to make their witness. And one of the standouts has been actor, comedian and podcast host Michael Rappaport.  Now, he is a real New Yorker. He takes his faith and his culture as a Jewish person very seriously. And he says he hears what's happening, and he sees what's happening even in what was his party, the Democratic Party. And he joins me now. Mike, appreciate you being here.  Thanks for having me, Chris. How you doing? Well, I've been better. But I think it's about the good fight, and it's about standing up for what makes sense. I never thought in my life, you know, you and I come from the same place, same kind of friends. And I always thought that my Jewish brothers had graduated to whiteness just like I have, right? My father was considered an ethnic. He was an Italian. I'm a white guy. I figured you were a white guy, too. You're not a white guy. You're a Jew. And I have Jews, and I'm proud to be Mishpuka.  I'm proud to be extended family to the Jews I choose as family, but I never thought I'd be thanked for them in America for acknowledging their right to exist. I never thought that.  There would be 50 hostages still in captivity 648 days later. I never thought that in New York City they would be continuing to rip down posters of those hostages. I never thought they would be ripping them down the day after the posters were put up. I never thought on the streets of New York City people would be screaming about globalizing the Intifada. I never imagined any of this.  It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, unbelievable time. And unfortunately, anti-Jewishness, anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism is at an all-time high. I wish I knew why, how we got here, but here we are. It's an amazing, amazing thing to witness. On top of the fact that, like I said, there's 50 hostages, two of whom are American, are still in captivity.  And look, everybody talks about Israel having to stop, right? It's too much, it's too long, it's too severe. Nobody says anything about Hamas surrendering and relinquishing all power and releasing people from their control. Nobody puts any onus on Hamas. And now we see with the Epstein files,  Left fringe and right fringe are united in their suspicion that the reason we haven't gotten more information is because Israel's behind it. He's a Mossad agent. Israel's telling Trump to shut up about it. What do you make of that?  Well, you're talking about Mr. America Last, Mr. Bought and Sold. You're talking about Qatari's little love doll, Tucker Carlson. He doesn't have that spunk. He was sitting in front of the president of Iran. He didn't have that spunk.  when he was in front of the president of Iran. He didn't have that same spunk that he had this weekend at that conference that I would imagine he got paid to show up at. He didn't have that spunk in front of Putin. But when he's in front of an audience, he's got all that spunk. In front of the guy, the president of Iran, he's like giving a manicure-pedicure massage. What Tucker Carlson says means nothing to me regarding the Jews. This is a guy who, in my opinion, has turned into an Iranian sex doll.  He's America last. He complained about the attack against Iran. He's supposed to be America first. Iran has been saying for years that they want to destroy America first. And so I think Tucker Carlson speaks for nobody but himself. I think he's a performer who is now bought and sold.  In regards to the Epstein situation, listen, it all comes back to the Jews. Even Twitter hacked Elmo. You know, he got his Twitter hacked the other day, and it was the Jews. And he had an opportunity. He could have said something about everybody else, but it was just the Jews. It wasn't Latinos. It wasn't the Italians. It wasn't  Short people, tall people, black people, LGBTQ, Elmo got hacked, and it was only the Jews, just the Jews, and only the Jews who are to blame for everything. So it's our time, but I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that  It's the\u2014we are the last acceptable people to openly, outwardly, aggressively, passionately hate. And it's happening all over the world. It's happening in my city with this socialist Democrat, who I think is a Democrat in name only. He's a Dino, this Zoran guy.  who calls for the globalization of the intifada in New York City. His best friend, Khalil Muhammad, calls for the globalization of the intifada in New York City. And we are this close to having a person like that.  become mayor of what should be considered the greatest city in the world. But the fact that this guy's even in contention is a slap in the face. Whether he wins or loses, it is a slap in the face that this person, who will not even have the decency and the courage  to articulate exactly what globalizing intifada means. And he screams it and yells it and hangs out with other people that scream it and yell it in New York City. It's a crazy time, but here we are. But I always remind myself and the rest of the world and the Jewish people and Zionist people that the Jews are going nowhere.  And Israel is going nowhere. So you could scream, yell, conspiracy theory, you know, tweet and all that stuff. We've been through it all. We've heard it all. We've seen it all. We're not going anywhere, period. Mike, what do you say to people, especially when they're Jewish?  And they say, listen, I'm not anti-Semitic. I'm anti-Zionist. I think that Israel is out of line. Israel is an oppressive force. They are an agent of U.S. interests. And the land was stolen. And I'm a Jew. So, you know, or I love Jews, but I'm just anti-Zionist. Israelis have the...  Israelis have the most to complain about their government and the country. They do it all the time. Before October 7, there was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people protesting in the streets. Israel complains enough about it. So, listen, Israel is a flawed government. It's a flawed country. The United States is a flawed government with a flawed country. New York City, my city, is a flawed city.  And we have the right to push and complain and want better, just like people have the right to complain about things in Israel. But it's been two years, and so many people are just blaming Israel and not really educating themselves. And the reality of the situation is, it takes two to tango. And I guarantee you, all these people that want to talk about Israel and all that stuff, and Zionist this and Zionist that, Zionism simply means  the right for Israel to exist as a sovereign nation. I wish that word never, ever was conjured up, because it sounds like some exotic plant or some exotic way of thinking. It simply means that Israel has the right to exist. And all these people on these college campuses, they would love to live in Israel before they would love to live in any one of these countries that we've been talking about, let alone in Gaza.  Gaza's hell, and it's not because of the innocent people in Gaza. It's because of the people that run that place. And they've ran it into the ground. They've ran this place into the ground. There should be casinos. There should be strip clubs. There should be Chick-fil-A's. There should be Starbucks. There should be the Gaza International Film Festival. And it never, ever, ever is going to happen because of Hamas.  Mike, what do you think needs to be done to change the recognition of what is right and wrong in this situation? Because it seems to be going and accelerating in the direction against Israel, at least here in America. Unfortunately, Chris,  It's education. And Israel lost the PR war. We've lost the social media war. We've lost the propaganda war. We've lost the war in the media by, you know, some of the big brands of media. How many mistakes and how many retractions could be made by, you know, the number one brands in news? It's going to take a long time.  But it all comes down to just educating people. And it sucks that we're sort of at square one, but here we are. Well, Michael, I'll tell you what. You always got a platform here to talk about it. And I am outspoken when it comes to what I see and what is right and what is wrong. I appreciate you doing the same, and I appreciate you doing it here at NewsNation.  I appreciate you, Chris. Thanks for having me. All right. Take care of yourself, and we'll be in touch. Four minutes and 15 seconds. So here's what we should be obsessed with right now, all right? You want to treat each other with respect. You also have to keep your eyes open about what real threats are, OK? Vladimir Putin just said he doesn't give a damn what President Trump thinks about him or what he's doing. He just hit Ukraine as hard as they ever have. So now what?  We'll take a look at what is likely and what it means for us.  Putin responded to Trump's sanctioning and giving more weapons to Ukraine by bombing the place in a way that we haven't seen in recent memory. So, what does it mean? I want to bring in Kurt Volker, the former NATO ambassador and US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations. Thank you so much, Kurt, for joining us. I don't think many people with your level of expertise are surprised that Putin wanted to show, at least initially,  that he is unbowed. But was this the right move for America? We thought, when we listened to the Secretary of State, that America was going to walk away from Ukraine."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2138.144, "text": " Yeah. No, this was definitely the right move. So there are a couple of components here. One, taking away the uncertainty that Ukraine can continue to access American arms and ammunition. They'll be paid for. They won't be coming from American taxpayers. They'll be paid for. But that access is available. That's a very important signal to send. That's what President Trump did yesterday. Second, he's got NATO involved.  If you remember during the Biden administration, there was a ban on NATO getting involved in any way in Ukraine. We always did it through bilateral or other mechanisms to avoid NATO-izing our response. He's got NATO involved now. That's very positive as well.  threatening secondary sanctions. And a lot of people wanted him to just pull the trigger right away. But I think the threat is good, because he's giving Vladimir Putin a warning that his trade partners are going to dry up if he doesn't end the war. And it's actually a signal to China  that they need to start putting pressure on Putin to end the war, or else they're going to start paying higher tariffs for their goods in the U.S. So, this was a set of good measures. And, as you said, Chris, of course, Putin just rejects it. Putin doesn't want to appear to be pressured by the United States. And he wants to try to portray or project an image of strength and invincibility. So, that's why he launched these major attacks overnight."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2219.33, "text": " How do you account for the shift? One, the president campaigned on how wrong it was for Biden to keep arming Ukraine, that it wasn't our situation and that, you know, maybe Russia is not as bad as everybody says, and Putin, maybe he's not such a bad guy. And now he's doing exactly what Biden was doing. I don't know that the price tag was ever really... Yes, people complained about how much money were given to Ukraine, not necessarily just for weapons, but just in general.  And how do you account for the shift?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2252.776, "text": " Well, I think there's a couple of things. First off, Trump never really said he opposed aid to Ukraine. He said he opposed the taxpayers' money being used for Ukraine. And this now has flipped this on its head. So the Europeans are paying, American defense industry is getting paid, Ukraine's getting the weapons that it needs. This is actually a very good deal. The second thing is that he complained that Biden didn't have a strategy. Remember the slogan from the Biden administration was, as long as it takes.  But nobody could tell you what it was. We were just going to do this forever. Trump has flipped that to say we're going to end the war. And he's been pushing relentlessly for a ceasefire. And he's manipulated or maneuvered the U.S. and Ukraine so that we are in alignment.  calling for a cease-fire and having a shared economic interest through this minerals deal. And Putin has become the outlier who's resisting a cease-fire. And now Trump is putting the pressure on Putin. You have to agree to a cease-fire too. So, I think this is consistent with where Trump has been going all along.

Isn't that the main agitator for Putin, ostensibly, in the first place, that this is exactly what he didn't want? So what does it mean that you do this, and what does it mean if, I don't know what Trump asked or didn't ask, I don't think it really matters, we'll never get a straight answer anyway, but if Ukraine has weapons that can reach out and touch inside Moscow, is that a good thing?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 24, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2346.533, "text": " It is a good thing. So, first off, getting NATO involved is very good. Not doing so conveyed to Putin that we were afraid of escalation. We were afraid of doing something that might provoke him. And Trump just blew through that yesterday, saying, no, we have this NATO secretary general here.  NATO countries are going to buy the weapons. NATO is going to coordinate the delivery. He had no qualms about it. That is a signal to Putin that, oh, this is actually more coordinated, more unified a Western response than he was expecting. So I think that's a very good thing. And on the long range, until the Russian people and Putin himself feels that they are getting hit where it hurts,  they're just going to keep going. And Ukraine should, and I think has been urged by the United States, to stick to military targets. Don't copy what the Russians do in terms of bombing cities and civilians, but go after fuel depots, go after airfields, go after aircraft, go after drone factories. And even at long range, you can do that.

And ultimately,  Ultimately, it is going to end up being the consumer that pays that money. So for a short period of time, maybe the business is eating it. So if you're an importer and you're Nike or you're Apple, you may be eating it for a short period of time. If you're the importer, you may be eating it for a short period of time.

So the uncertainty piece breaks down into a bunch of different silos. So we had the one big, beautiful bill, uncertainty piece. Now, the bigger uncertainty in that bill was really what was going to happen to the personal income taxes. The vast majority of the corporate taxes were law. They were not going to expire at the end of this year.  But on the flip side, there were about $4.5 trillion of tax relief on the individual side, meaning that every taxpayer's rates would go up. Yes, we would bring back the standard deductions. We would bring back the itemized deduction. We would bring back all the complexity of filing tax returns. And I think that had a highly  a huge effect on the way people were thinking about what their after-tax spending would have been or could have been if Congress was not able to roll those rates forward. Not only did they roll those rates forward, they actually put back some of the stimuli for lower-income families that was in the original bill.  which I think are very good and supportive. There's enhanced child care credits. There's enhanced credits for families. So look, we end up in a place from the tax standpoint, from the income tax standpoint, where I think that variable is off the table. We know what it is. It's baked. It's signed. Nothing's going to change. And people cannot say, I don't understand what's going on with taxes at this point.  And in fact, on the business side, there was more incentive in there to go out and manufacture and build in the United States. You got enhanced depreciation. You got enhanced R&D credits. So all of the things that you would want or need to manufacture and build in the United States were included in the tax bill.  So now we get to the point where I think we were starting with Joe is, OK, if I'm going to go build it, I'm going to manufacture in the United States, OK, I'm starting maybe to understand the cost of manufacturing the facility. Once I manufacture a facility, I've got two inputs. I've got to bring labor into the facility. And I'm not sure what my labor costs are going to be. And I have to be raw materials in the facility.  And a lot of those raw materials are not manufactured here in the United States. And even if we say we will manufacture those here in the United States, realistically, that's a five plus year project. And what we're seeing on some of these deals where we're making deals to manufacturing things in the United States, like magnets,  the price is dramatically different than where the current clearing price of a magnet is today. Right. So am I going to build a factory, am I going to, am I going to go borrow? Do you think these answers aren't real then? Things are real, but the question, am I going to go borrow a billion dollars plus to build a factory if one of my major input costs just doubled? Right.

And every president that I've certainly worked with over the past 40 years has had plenty to say critically about the Federal Reserve and its policy. But I don't see the president firing Chairman Powell.

Now, Bank of America is in the green. Good morning."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 32.245, "text": " Good morning, Nathan. A complete turnaround story in just a few minutes. BAC is your ticker for Bank of America. And as you said, it is flying this morning, higher by 2.4% in the pre-market and climbing as I speak. Trading at about, we should call it $47.  and change to ticker BAC, as I mentioned. But these intraday charts, which work beautifully on radio, really tell the story, which is that this kind of spike higher that you've seen is now reflected in every financial stock that is trading this morning. And remember, we are still waiting for some of the other bank earnings to cross the wire, as well, this morning. But the big, big takeaway, and I have my cheat sheet up for our very own Wall Street correspondent, Shanali Basick,  basically saying that it's their net interest income guidance that is stable. And that's going to be really, really crucial in terms of what we see there. Remember, Brian Moynihan has also been very, very positive when it comes to the U.S. economy. So, keep an eye on Bank of America. BAC is the ticker  Looking forward of course is seeing what the commentary looks like around that stock in the meantime a couple of others I want to put on your radar as well Nathan one of them is specifically ASML and this is of course a European company one of the majors kind of chip equipment makers But is listed when it comes to the US markets, and that's going to be a crucial one It is one of the biggest droppers in biggest weights biggest droppers. I'm gonna go ahead and call it  do it.  Chip stocks is crucial. You see that in the likes of lamb research for example you LRC X is your ticker down two point six percent trading at ninety eight dollars a share and Still dropping as we speak. It's not just lamb research applied materials is the other one am AT down about two point six percent trading at a hundred and ninety four dollars a share there so seeing some real pain when it comes to chip maker stock the guidance around ASML is  is really the canary in the coal mine here, because it's falling the most since April. And that is crucial. The CEO walking back that growth forecast to complete, talk about turnaround that you are seeing in the chip sector. And this is, of course, after the fact that we've seen the volatility around whether or not the likes of Nvidia, AMD, et cetera, can actually export some of the chips from the United States to China. So, we'll see how that all shakes out.  But speaking of policy out of Washington really impacting a sector, let's talk a little bit about the pharmaceutical sector, Nathan. I think that is crucial this morning. Johnson & Johnson is an interesting one. Remember, Donald Trump has talked about pharmaceutical tariffs coming as soon as the end of this month. It's far earlier than a lot of folks expected.  He's talking about an earlier start, and then ultimately trying to build it up to 200% eventually. But what that does is not shake the pharmaceutical sector very much. And there seems to be an appreciation here that this was largely expected. There is a slow ramp-up, as opposed to a massive number imposed at the start. Johnson & Johnson, I think, is the key one that you want to keep an eye on here. J&J is your ticker, higher by 1.3%, because they actually just reported earnings this morning.  And they are talking about beating Wall Street's expectations. They raise their full-year outlook. Not a lot of pharmaceutical companies are doing that. And they're also saying that the tariff story may not be that scary because there is an appreciation from just how complex the supply chains are. So that's going to be one narrative you want to watch this morning, Nathan."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Tariffs"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 239.842, "text": " The Stock Movers Podcast, from Bloomberg Radio.

In the interim period,  China dumped material onto the market, crashed prices, and sent the one company, Rare Earth Company, into bankruptcy. A few years ago, Xi Jinping said he didn't like the way cobalt was being priced.  And he announced he was going to look into that. The one cobalt mine in the development project in the state of Idaho that was starting to ramp up, the US government was an investor in, announced that they were going into care and maintenance because the prices crashed. It's just the signal that China has because it's not just that they're the biggest producer, it's also important to recognize they're also the largest purchaser.

Now,  This is still a fraction of the worst inflation under the Biden administration, but an uptick like that was troublesome enough to help shave off more than 400 points from the Dow. So what does this mean for you? It means you're paying more for things like food, toys, clothing, household appliances.  Economists say it's a sign that tariffs are getting passed on to consumers, a trend that could continue if the global trade war gets real and gets really ugly. But at the same time, prices for new cars dropped. Another gauge and another look at the impact of these tariffs.

Very low inflation. So what you should do is lower the rate. The Fed should lower the rate immediately. We should have the lowest interest rate anywhere in the world, and we don't. Jerome Powell has done a terrible job, and frankly, I don't think he could do a worse job. He's called everything wrong.  All right, let's go right now to News Nation's Kelly Meyer, live for us at the White House.

Thank you so much. Let's get some reaction now from Chris Silliza, NewsNation political contributor and senior advisor at the DGA Group. Chris, great to have you. Okay, inflation back up to its highest level since February, second month in a row that it's gone up. Economists are blaming Trump's tariffs. Are they right?  Well, as a non-economist, I can tell you the issue, Elizabeth, is that politically there seems to be a real correlation here, right? Inflation was going down. Donald Trump started imposing tariffs. Stock market went down. Inflation has at least started to tick up as the vast majority of economists said that it would.  Donald Trump bad-mouthing Jerome Powell and saying they need to lower the rates. My guess would be if you gave Jerome Powell truth serum, he would say to Donald Trump, don't stop imposing tariffs. And that's the thing I don't know about. Look, we're 16 days from the August 1 deadline, another deadline about tariffs and putting it in place against lots of people, lots of trading partners if we can't make deals with them.  It's terrible politics. It has been from the start. It now is looking like the promise that most economists made that tariffs were going to drive up inflation. And I note, Elizabeth, it's inflation on things like furniture, clothing. These are things that will impact people. And food. It's starting to happen. Food. It's starting to happen as economists said it would. Now, inflation hasn't surged, but as you point out, highest since February.  I don't know if that makes Donald Trump reconsider tariffs on August 1st. It should. Certainly, politically speaking, I don't know if it will. Yeah, it's worth noting, okay, inflation is 2.7%, 2.9% by some gauges, core inflation. Under President Biden, it was over 9%. That's right.  We are in completely, even though it's gone up and it's the highest since February, we're still way below what it was under President Biden. The point is this was a huge factor in Trump's campaign. He knew, he heard people when they said it cost too much and we're inching back toward that.  And the reality, too, Elizabeth, is look, 99 economists who looked at his tariff plan said it's going to raise inflation. They would predict sort of different numbers of what it was going to raise, but 99 out of 100 would say that. One, who probably worked for Donald Trump, would say, no, everything's going to be fine. So again, it's not like this was unforeseeable. Now, this is the worst it gets, to your point.  Right. Honestly, I think Donald Trump will live with that. I think what would worry me if I was a Republican elected official looking at these numbers is the trend line. That's it. You know, if we're moving up and the number continues to kind of go up, up, up, well, you know, the closer we get to 2026, that would start to worry me, particularly if Trump is bumping it with more tariffs.  Meantime, President Trump had this huge announcement today with this massive investment in AI and energy in Pittsburgh. The energy secretary posted, quote, the AI race is the second Manhattan project.  We are in a real race with China, and there are very high stakes, especially he's right when, you know, likening it to the Manhattan Project. Absolutely. Absolutely. Look, I think that the average person doesn't grasp, and I understand why, it doesn't affect your daily life right now, in a way that the internet in 1993 didn't affect your daily life, but all of a sudden, you know, it becomes 2002, 2003, and it's changing everything.  I think AI has the potential to do that. I think it's gonna restructure, just for example, the energy sector, the amount of energy required, Trump has talked about this, just to keep all this computing power available is going to be vast. I mean, it's gonna reshape, I think, look, as a journalist, it's gonna reshape journalism. I think it's gonna reshape the energy sector. I think it's gonna reshape, we talk a lot about blue collar jobs, it's gonna reshape. I think it's gonna reshape a lot of white collar jobs. I don't know that it's,  a one-year time horizon where that happens, but I'd be very surprised if it wasn't in a five-year time horizon. I was just about to say, it's definitely within a five-year time horizon. Our lives will look very, very different in five years. We just don't know how. We're going to switch gears to the so-called Jeffrey Epstein client list, which is a MAGA headache turned full-blown raging migraine that refuses to go away. A very frustrated President Trump was just asked moments ago about this on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews. Listen.  I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It's pretty boring stuff. It's sordid, but it's boring. And I don't understand why it keeps going.  All right, Chris Solis is still with me. Also joining us now is Steve Krakauer. He's a NewsNation contributor and executive producer for The Megyn Kelly Show. Steve, the president moments ago just said, this is boring. Why are people so interested in this? This was a few hours after he directed Pam Bondi to release whatever she thinks is credible. First of all, is anything he can do right now going to mitigate the outrage that's been building?  well i think i think you can do i would say there's nothing you can set it you can if you give you a pick it's boring let's just let's just play this out i'm open-minded the idea that the jeffrey epstein quote-unquote files are boring there's nothing in them to redacted they're not gonna see anything i'm open-minded to that will prove it  explain it. You know, at the very least, put Pam Bondi and Kash Patel out in front of a microphone, give a press conference, explain what happened. Hey, listen, Kash Patel says, hey, I was with Glenn back in December of 2023. I got in the office and it's not at all what I thought, you know.  open-minded to that. And I think a lot of people who support the president would be as well. But right now, it's not going to work to just pretend it doesn't exist or, oh, just trust us, nothing to see here. That is not going to work. You have to take it seriously. You have to provide some level of transparency. And then I think people would listen. But they have not gone about that right now. And I think the idea of, OK, release some of the credible files, great, that's a start. But explain what you're seeing and just give it to the public straight.  Chris, this seems to be a series of unforced errors. I mean, you know, the old saying in politics is the cover-up is worse than the crime. We just have every single day another comment, another development, another sort of story that is changing. They're fueling the story as opposed to putting it out.  That's right. And that's the Steve's point, by the way, which is the only way that you can deal with this now is you have to at least look like you're putting everything out there. And you're you know, you have a press conference where Pam Bondi literally says, I will answer questions until no one has any more questions like that kind of press conference, because short of that, it's not going to just disappear. Now, it's clear that the strategy, to the extent there was a strategy, the strategy over the first week was ignore this.  That's a boring story. Nobody cares. That hasn't worked. You know, look, just today, Lauren Boebert, not exactly like an enemy of Donald Trump, comes out and says we need a special counsel. Mike Johnson, again, not an anti-Trump guy, says they need to release everything.  Nikki Haley, who we can debate her motives, but basically says, what you just said, cover up is worse than the crime, transparency is the answer. These are not Democrats or even the media saying, look, there's something that doesn't smell right here. These are people who are  Struck Candace Owens is no Trump hater These are people who are within the tent and I think they have to recognize that into Steve's point You can't you gotta do something, right? I'm not sure you gotta fire somebody but you gotta do something that looks like you acknowledge the fact that this doesn't Regular people's minds are not gonna wrap around this because it's a total contradiction what you said then and what you say now, right? You have to address that in some meaningful way  In the meantime, Steve, there are reports out today in Wired Magazine that metadata from the raw Epstein prison video the night that he killed himself shows that approximately two minutes and 53 seconds are missing from the jail camera recordings of the door of Epstein's cell. That's nearly three minutes of video that is missing, removed. This is only going to lend credence to those who are saying they're hiding something.  at least  You know, there's really graphic child pornography, things that we cannot show you. Well, no one's asking to see that. And, in fact, a lot of the things that we're asking to see are about the, you know, how did he get so rich? What kind of people, what kind of circles was he in? What sort of powerful people were in his orbit? That is not necessarily saying we're going to put a bunch of people's names out there, and we don't know whether they actually did the crimes that they're accused of.  There's a lot of gray area and middle ground between what the administration is saying we can't release and what is basically what they're doing now, which is nothing. There's a lot of area to mine here, and we know there are documents. Chris, Trump was asked directly this afternoon if his name was in the Epstein files. He did not directly answer the question, saying he only got, quote, a very quick briefing on what was in the Epstein files.  But it's important to note, just having your name in the file, whether it's Donald Trump or Bill Clinton, isn't any evidence of wrongdoing per se. No, look, I will tell you, Donald Trump's names are definitely in the Epstein file because he flew on Jeffrey Epstein's private plane, I'll note, with a very young Tiffany Trump and his wife at the time, Marla Maples, as well as Eric Trump when he was young. So did Bill Clinton. This is part of the problem, right?  It is hard, I think, to just release a list of names and be like, okay, well, you guys draw your own conclusions about their connections to Jeffrey Epstein. But I do think Steve is right. I think this is not an all or nothing issue. Just because I don't think we should just release every single person's name, whoever came into contact with Jeffrey Epstein, because people will assume guilt where there is no proven guilt, and that's wrong. At the same time, it seems to me  more than a two-page memo saying, all right, folks.  Everything's done here. Nothing is here. There's got to be something in between those two poles that they can find a place where a reasonable human being will say, OK, this feels OK. OK, I feel as though I've gotten at least as much of the picture as I can. Right. Elon Musk literally posted Donald Trump's in the Epstein files. That's why they're not going to release that. He posted that three weeks ago."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1031.865, "text": "So whether that's true or not, that's out in the ether also."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1034.468, "text": " We've known that his name is in the Epstein files.

Thank you so much, both of you, for joining us. Thanks, Elizabeth. All right. Coming up for us, studying while Jewish. It can make you a target on some campuses. Will the latest congressional hearing on college anti-Semitism make a difference? I'll speak live to the chairman of the committee that is taking that issue on next.  And then later, there's a new Cold War for control of the Arctic. And spoiler alert, we're not winning it. News Nation got an exclusive look at a new icebreaker ship that could help us catch up to China and Russia.  The ongoing showdown between the government and American universities over campus anti-Semitism and free speech continued today with a fiery hearing on Capitol Hill. Republican lawmakers with the House Committee on Education and the Workforce spent three hours grilling the leaders of Georgetown University, the City University of New York, and the University of California at Berkeley.  At issue, why the schools appear to take a much more permissive attitude toward anti-Semitism than they would toward racism against black students or homophobia against gay students. Why so-called time, place and manner restrictions on protests and demonstrations have been sporadically enforced at best when it comes to pro-Palestinian demonstrations that cross the line, in some cases creating unsafe environments for Jewish students.

In one case, right as Florida Congressman Randy Fine was speaking, and he was having none of it. Emanuel Ness, the chair of your political science department, said he supports, quote, resistance by any means necessary, which includes violence. How can you say those statements that you support your Jewish roots? Shut up and get out of here. Gentlemen must suspend. Gentlemen must suspend. Get out of here, you loser.  For more, we're joined by Michigan Republican Congressman Tim Walberg, who's chair of the committee that held today's hearing. Congressman, great to have you with us today. Tell me how you picked the three schools that you had at this hearing today.  Elizabeth, it's good to be with you. And the pick of the schools were across spectrum. We wanted to make sure that we've touched not only Harvard or Columbia, Rutgers, other Ivy League schools, Penn, but we want to look at other schools as well that have had significant problems on their campuses, schools that appeal to different people. CUNY, City University of New York, really has a more moderate income  student load that is there. Cal Berkeley, of course, is known for demonstrations of all kinds over the years that go on at college campuses. Georgetown is right here in the heart of D.C.  a religious university as well. So we wanted to get a cross-spectrum because, bottom line, Elizabeth, we want schools all across the nation to know we're not going to accept this, and this isn't going to go away as long as anti-Semitism continues to erupt on campuses and destroy opportunities for Jewish students, and anti-Semitism seems to reign.  The chancellors of all three universities denied accusations of anti-Semitism. The chancellor of Berkeley pointed out that not all pro-Palestinian beliefs are necessarily anti-Semitic, the same way that not all critics of Israel are anti-Semitic. In fact, many Israelis are in fact critical of the Israeli government, and many Israelis believe Palestinians have a right to have a state of their own. Do you agree that in some cases there is nuance here?  Well, there is nuance, but all three of the university chancellor's presidents indicated, yes, there was anti-Semitism on their campus. Our concern was that they'd done very little to stop it until we called on them to have them in front of a hearing. Then we found responses taking, including suspension of some faculty, suspension of a student.  and things like that, but not until the push came. It was not Jewish students or Jewish individuals disrupting our hearing today. It's very clear this is unique to Jewish students who are followed home, who are threatened  who are quoted texts by their oppressors, and I think that word is useful in what they're attempting to do on campuses to destroy the opportunities for Jewish students and in fact run them off the campus. What should these schools, not just these three schools, but colleges across the country be doing with these  pro-Palestinian, and I don't want to say because they're not all one, they're not monolithic, but these protesters who are in fact anti-Semitic and who are in fact in some ways harassing and scaring Jewish students there.  Is Elizabeth absolutely right there? Not all pro-Palestinians are anti-Semitic, necessarily. But, sadly, what we're seeing is the pro-Palestinians that are anti-Semitic are ruling campuses. We know campuses all over the United States that don't allow anything like this to happen have stepped out early and said, we will not allow  anything that goes beyond free speech that takes away the rights and the opportunities of students on our campus. You will be suspended or removed from school, and a faculty member, you will be suspended as well. We are not gonna accept this where it gets into the lives, the opportunities of students simply because they're Jewish. Or, in some cases, appears of the Jewish students who are afraid to stand up and defend their Jewish  peers who they enjoy being friends with because of a fear that a teacher, a professor, will dox them. That's not a learning environment that ought to be on our college campuses. And it spreads into anti-Americanism as well. And very quickly, you know, we've had several of these Jewish students at several universities on this show to talk about their experience. We've seen in so many cases these pro-Palestinian, anti-Semitic protesters masked.  their masks and their faces completely covered. Why not insist that these schools say you are not allowed to protest for anything? You know, you can't even protest high prices at the cafeteria with a mask on. In other words, if you want to exercise your free speech, show your face.  I agree totally with that, and I appreciate our president, this administration, calling out that opportunity to say, you will not have masks on campus. Now, that again goes down to individual campuses. And there's where we have the power of the purse.  Because the federal dollar is going to schools, especially schools, to enforce it, absolutely. And I think that's what it's going to take when it hits their bottom line and they realize we're serious about this. We're not opposing First Amendment liberties. We're not opposing a normal campus situation where there's diversity and there's debate. But we are opposing it when it gets into violence and it gets in a situation where students, Jewish students specifically...  Do not feel safe on campus or able to enjoy the education they ought to have. Congressman Tim Walbert, chair of the committee today, holding the hearing. Thank you, sir. I really appreciate you coming on the show.  Thank you. All right, coming up on America's fastest growing cable channel, we go out west where the Coast Guard is building a new icebreaker that will soon deploy to the Arctic. Could the United States finally compete with Russia and China's military might up north? That exclusive report next.  And a quick programming note, the first ever Hill Nation Summit will be held tomorrow. The event, hosted by NewsNation and our partners at The Hill, will feature interviews with top bipartisan lawmakers in Washington. NewsNation's all-day special coverage of the event starts at 6 a.m. Eastern.  As the world waits to see how Russian President Vladimir Putin will respond to President Trump's ultimatum on a peace deal with Ukraine, another conflict is simmering, or maybe thawing is the better word, in the Arctic. The race is on to see which country will dominate control of the icy waters between Alaska and Greenland.  The so-called Northwest Passage is not only economically and strategically crucial, the Arctic is a rich source of rare earth minerals that we all need for tech manufacturing. A robust ice-breaking fleet is necessary to pursue and protect American interests there.  Unfortunately, the United States is lagging very behind Russia and China, who have teamed up to patrol the Arctic waters together, even though China doesn't have any territory above the Arctic Circle. As News Nation's Nancy Liu reports, President Trump's big, beautiful bill just allocated some big, beautiful bucks to build a brand new fleet of icebreakers. Nancy, you're on the deck of one of those. You got an exclusive look. You're joining us live from Seattle. What does it look like? What did you see?  Well, Elizabeth, welcome on board the Storus. This is the Coast Guard's new icebreaking ship. It is currently temporarily berthed here in beautiful Seattle. But this is the first vessel to join our polar fleet in 25 years.

Unless you're heading up to the Arctic for a few months, let's not make you the captain quite yet. Nancy Liu, thanks so much. Interesting report. Coming up for us, for the past 60 years, the CIA said it didn't know anything about Lee Harvey Oswald before he assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Will new documents just obtained by The Washington Post reveal that's a lie?  Will we ever get the whole story? The journalist who called for transparency decades ago joins me live next.  All right, you're permitted to roll your eyes when you hear the words conspiracy theory, but every once in a while some new evidence is declassified that makes even the most skeptical wonder what else the government might be hiding. Today is one of those days, and the topic once again is the assassination of John F. Kennedy. According to new documents obtained by the Washington Post, the CIA knew much more about Lee Harvey Oswald  prior to JFK's assassination than it led the public to believe. It turns out a CIA officer known as Howard had the assassin on his radar for months. That officer's real name was George Joanides, and in 1963, Joanides helped oversee a group of Cuban students who were opposed to Fidel Castro. The group had contact with Oswald, who claimed to share their beliefs.  Now, for the last 60 years, the CIA has denied that this Officer Howard ever existed. It also claimed it wasn't monitoring Lee Harvey Oswald in the months leading up to the assassination. Both of those claims now appear to be false. The revelation will, of course, fuel speculation that there was a larger cover-up, but was there?  Our next guest has spent his entire career fighting for the truth. Longtime JFK researcher and Washington Post reporter Jefferson Morley says he told his editors back in 1999 that Officer Joanides was a front page story. The Post squashed the story at the time. Today, 26 years later, that story made front page news. Jefferson Morley joins us now. I guess better late than never, you call the story.  Exactly, Elizabeth. You know, I always said this was a good story. And the story that The Washington Post published today proves that. This is a very newsworthy story about an aspect of the JFK assassination story that was never known before.  and has now been confirmed, these false statements that the CIA made about its lack of knowledge. One of the authors of a memo to that effect has come forward and admitted that his memo was false, which is welcome. We're beginning to get to what was really going on. But the story here is, this cover story, we didn't know anything about Oswald before the assassination, that cover story is over.  Why would the CIA lie about Agent Howard ever even existing or lie about the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was, in fact, on their radar and communicating with this Agent Howard? We don't know that he was communicating with Howard, but I mean, the question is, was Joe Enniti interested in Oswald for some propaganda purpose and didn't understand that Oswald posed a threat to the president?  Or was Joe Ranitti and other CIA officers manipulating Oswald to take the blame for the assassination, which he denied participating in? So what these documents do is they open up that question. We don't have an answer to that question.  Joe Anides was assigned in later years to be a liaison between the CIA and Congress as Congress tried to investigate the JFK assassination. He stonewalled Congress repeatedly on information. He was later given a career commendation medal in 1981 for his work as that liaison. Was the CIA rewarding him for inhibiting the investigation?  The memo recommending him for the medal makes quite clear that he was honored for doing exactly that. What we have here is, you know, a CIA fox was in charge of the JFK hit head now.  You know, the person who was supposed to be guarding, the person who was supposed to be getting at the truth was actually preventing it from coming out. Congresswoman Ana Paulina Luna, who pushed for these files to be released and made public, said this confirms that the CIA was lying to the American people and that there was a cover-up. Is she right?  Yeah, these documents show that very clearly. This episode where Joe Anides was interested in monitoring Oswald has never been explained. It was explained with the story, oh, Oswald was a lone gunman and we didn't know anything about him. That second part now has been definitively debunked. They did know about it.  The Warren Commission ruled, decided after its investigation, that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Years later, a congressional investigation in 1976 determined that Lee Harvey Oswald was part of a, quote, probable conspiracy. Do these files released today shed any light on which of those two conclusions is correct? Because they can't both be correct.  They certainly call into question more the first conclusion. The Warren Commission. Yeah, the story of a lone gunman, that's been at least half debunked by this file. Lee Harvey Oswald was not alone. He was watched and observed by people, senior CIA officers, in the fall of 1963, in the weeks before President Kennedy was killed. There's no longer any dispute about that. All right.  Jefferson Morley, I'm sure you were gratified to see that headline today on the front page of The Washington Post, finally, nearly three decades after you were pushing for it.

Everything we've heard from the Chinese customers who would buy this ship suggests they want it in very large quantities, and we've seen NVIDIA announce that billions of dollars of sales would stem from the ability to sell into China.

It's unclear to me exactly what the primary driver was.  And I think we've seen many twists and turns in the chip war, including under the Trump administration.

And companies like DeepSeek, like Alibaba, like ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, they've signaled a desire to buy large volumes of these ships because they need them. They've already built their AI models on NVIDIA systems and Huawei, which is the competitor to NVIDIA,  can't right now produce domestically the types of AI chips that are needed at scale.

The fact that Huawei's also smuggling in still large volumes of chips and components for its chips from abroad shows the challenges it faces in terms of ramping up production.

So that gives an opportunity for options buyers to basically buy protection to the downside for relatively inexpensive. So you can go out to August  and buy, let's say, a 610 put on SPY or 6100 on SPX for roughly 1% of the stock or ETF's value.

And that gives you a significant downside protection for relatively inexpensive. And I think one way that you can also offset the cost of that protection is to also consider selling some upside calls right now.  So if you own stocks or ETFs in your portfolio, you can sell some cover calls. You could probably collect close to half a percent of the stocks of the of your portfolio's value in the next 30 days and use that to buy that downside put.

And what that allows you to do is probably the cost of those September puts will probably be a little bit higher, but not meaningfully higher. And by that time, you've collected maybe half a percent, three quarters of a percent of your portfolio's value selling those covered calls. And you can do that again.

And if that becomes reality, I think one of the things that you can do is that markets will likely react relatively positively to that news, even though it's relatively priced in, in my opinion.

Podcasts, radio, news.  Good morning, I'm Nathan Hager. And I'm Karen Moskow. Here are the stories we're following today. Karen, we begin with new developments on tariffs. President Trump says he's likely to impose levies on pharmaceuticals as soon as the end of the month. While he didn't specify a rate, any tariff would likely impact the likes of Eli, Lilly, Merck, and Pfizer, which all produce drugs overseas. The president spoke to reporters and comments heard live on Bloomberg Radio.  Pharmaceuticals will be tariffed probably at the end of the month and we're going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build and then we're going to make it a very high tariff. And the president also says his timeline for implementing tariffs on semiconductors is similar.  Nathan, the president also predicted that he could strike two or three trade deals with countries before implementing his so-called reciprocal tariffs on August 1st. He also says he's reached a deal with Indonesia. Indonesia is very strong on copper, but we have full access to everything. We will pay no tariffs. So they are giving us access into Indonesia, which we never had. That's probably the biggest part of the deal. And the other part is they are going to pay 19%  And we are going to pay nothing. On social media, the president also said Indonesia has committed to purchase $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. And Karen, the president is also continuing his criticism of Jay Powell. That's as Bloomberg News has learned Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, is the early frontrunner to replace Powell as Fed chair next year.  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson says the formal process to find Powell's successor has already begun. In an interview heard right here on Bloomberg Radio, Besson suggested Powell should also not remain on the Fed's Board of Governors after his term as chair ends.  A lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion in advance of his or her nomination. And I can tell you, I think it'd be very confusing for the market for a former Fed chair to stay on also. Treasury Secretary Scott Besant also says he's part of the decision-making process, but the final decision will come from President Trump.  Nathan, Congress is a step closer to clawing back billions of dollars in funds for public broadcasting and foreign aid. The Senate has voted to advance $9.4 billion in cuts on a 51 to 50 vote, with Vice President J.D. Vance breaking the tie. The measure would cancel funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS and NPR. The networks have warned that could force local stations to close.

This is over the administration's handling of documents related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. This month, the Justice Department said it had no new information to release on the case.

Shares of NVIDIA closed at an all-time high. CEO Jensen Wang says he should get the first batch of U.S. licenses to export H20 AI chips to China soon, but he says it's still unclear how many licenses the U.S. will approve.

Inflation also in focus in Europe this morning. In fact, UK inflation rose to its highest level since January 2024. CPI ticked up to 3.6% in June from 3.4% previously. Economists had expected the figure to remain unchanged.  Time now for a look at some of the other stories making news in New York and around the world.

I think we've already mentioned a couple  germanium and graphite, which are crucial for everything from our weapons systems to batteries and electronics.

The critical mineral supply chain is remarkably complex and it is opaque. It is not like oil and gas.  They're huge commodities, they're liquid, they're widely known, pricing's clear. When it comes to some of these critical minerals, how do you even realize price discovery? What is the price? And who's exerting that pricing power? It's very difficult to even understand that, much less the provenance of some of these things. Some of the minerals, these minor but critically important minerals are actually produced alongside other commodities.  The issue, germanium, the lack of that, there are defense primes who are in really dire straits because they can't source it. Where do they get it? This is an enormous problem. The challenge we have is also where within the U.S. government should that kind of tracking sit.  We have, because the administration, successive administrations, the bipartisan nature of this has elevated the awareness of critical minerals. One of the issues now is we have about 15 federal agencies asserting some kind of involvement. How are we going to lead that? How are we going to coordinate that?

And the consequence of that is ultimately higher prices for the consumer. As you start to unwind that, you end up getting exactly the opposite result. You get more reliable and cheaper electricity.

And so as you bring down the cost of such a ubiquitous input as energy, you end up bringing down prices throughout the economy. Sure enough, energy has really been the deciding factor in each of this year's CPI reports. If we go back and we look at these different months, it has been the times when energy prices go up, like in the month of June, that we see the overall CPI going up a little bit faster.  And the CPI has slowed down every time we get those reductions in energy prices.

But as you know, China is a dominant processor of 19 of the 20 minerals the International Energy Agency considers key minerals. And China has 70% of the global processing capabilities for these minerals. Through export controls, the CCP wields access to these minerals to advance their global policy goals like a guillotine over everyone's head. In December 2024, China banned the export of gallium, germanium,  in antimony to the U.S. In February 2025, China further restricted experts of tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium, and other minerals. And in April 2025, China cracked down on the exports of seven heavy, rare earth and magnets derived from them. Dysprosium, gadolinium,  luteinum, samarium, scandium, terbium, and so on. And now, you know, the fact of the matter is most Americans, the folks that we're talking to at home, have not heard these names since studying the periodic table. And even then, I'm not sure they stored them to memory in their high school science classes. But it's important to break this down for the American people. It's critical.  of the semiconductor telecommunication defense and renewable energy industries. People around the country need to know this critical impact. Thankfully, President Biden understood the importance of securing our critical mineral supply chains. Under his leadership, the State Department worked with the Development Finance Corporation and our allies to ensure that American businesses were shielded from the CCP's market pressures. In 2022, we established the Mineral Security Partnership,  the State Department program that was dedicated to accelerating the development of diverse critical mineral supply chains free from China's control. But we have a challenge at hand because the Trump administration has gone forward with reductions in force that can have an impact that undermines all of these efforts. This awareness that we do have in a bipartisan way  to have access to critical minerals. And we saw just last Friday the State Department lose through their reduction of force and firing of  1,300 employees as a part of a plan to shrink that workforce in a way that is not thoughtful. And instead of working to secure our critical mineral supply trains, Trump is firing experts and causing those remaining to be distracted by fear for their jobs instead of focusing on American interests. And it is a real distraction.  So, Undersecretary Fernandez, you know, I'd love to hear from you how these reductions and forced harm states work with other federal agencies like the DFC to help American businesses secure our supply chains. And what should we be doing to work with DFC to continue to play a supporting role in securing critical mineral supply chains?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Export", "Import"], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 218.326, "text": " Thank you for your question. We could talk for a long time about this, and I'll be brief. This has got to be a bipartisan issue because it's a bipartisan problem. It's also an international problem. Our allies and partners understand that this is a problem, which is why we need a strategy. Part of that strategy has to include the DFC.  The DFC was a very good partner in the mineral security partnership. Why? Because funding is often the problem that we all need to crack. There are a number of changes in the DFC authorization that in my eyes would help. The equity scoring, for example, there's a penalty for investing in equity.  The number of countries, the types of countries they can finance projects in, upper middle income countries are a problem. Argentina and Chile have the world's largest deposits of lithium. And yet, the DFC can't work in those two countries. And so we've got to find a strategy that turns the DFC loose.  that allows us to use all of the tools at our disposal, Ex-Im Bank and TDA as well. And I think that's what the MSP did. And frankly, we had very good cooperation from the DFC.

And if you can talk about to what extent can domestic production reduce this dependence, and why is international engagement still essential?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 59.262, "text": " When you look at what we're dealing with and look in history, 20th century, beginning of the 20th century, the United States became a powerhouse because of our energy. Back then it was relied upon on coal, made the steel, we did an awful lot of things and we basically pulled ourselves out of poverty, became an industrial leader. That was necessary for us to have reliable, dependable, affordable energy.  Today critical minerals is the same as that energy was needed back in the 20th century So the 21st century the new boom is going to be basically critical minerals Well, everything that we do depends on these superconductors and the magnets and all the different things and special alloys and steels that we use Those are building blocks where I think that we've made a mistake that we should have trade Agreements and we should have basically penalties with tariffs in order to protect our building blocks. That's it  Everything else should be used as an incentive to do trade. But protecting, basically, our allies and countries across the world that we can rely on. And we have a chain of allies that we can depend on. You have Canada, tremendous cache of rare earth minerals. Australia, tremendous cache.  United States, possibility of a tremendous cache. We weren't allowed to mine and process. And then you have Japan and South Korea able to do refining. We have a building block right there that we could start and get in the game very quickly. You got to let the private sector in. We can't take this debt on, continue to take all these debts on and the risk.  Those are the things, and what happens if you let China control that, it'll be no different than what Putin tried to do with oil and gas and our allies, same thing."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 158.583, "text": "So you've got to have independence.  the competitors, what policies can we consider to shield domestic and allied mineral producers from predatory pricing tactics?"}, {"keywords": ["Tariffs", "China"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 177.326, "text": "Yeah, thank you for the question. I think this is key. What I don't think we can do is rely on traditional conventional norms and practices because China rejects them. We talked, Senator spoke about the rare earth dispute in 2010.  And the response from the United States at the time, along with Europe and Japan, was to initiate a WTO action against China. It took two years for that to be concluded, and it found what we knew, China was cheating. But in that interim, China dumped material onto the market and killed the economic basis for that company.  They went out of business. So what we have to do is a new way of thinking about these things. In terms of what the steps we should pursue, one of those would be, and Senator mentioned tariffs, I think target tariffs is exactly  the right approach. China, according to the International Energy Agency, recently concluded that China's cost of capital is 50% less than anywhere else in the world to do a mining project. That's very hard to compete with. Second, the issues on how they do their business. It's very opaque. We don't know how they do their business. It's hard to see. What we know is that they violate environmental and human rights all the time. And actually, last year, the Department of Labor issued a report underscoring that.  I think a higher degree of scrutiny is important. It could create differential pricing. We always talk about having a green premium because there will be a commodity produced in a way with lower carbon. But industry is reluctant to pay more for it because they're competing against a commodity at a lower cost.  Rather than ask U.S. industry and U.S. companies to pay more, we should try to level the playing field. I think the administration is keen to do that by increasing the costs on the Chinese side. At the same time, we have a pacing challenge. The senator noted the amazing resource abundance in America. It takes a long time to develop a mine.  We have to go where the rocks are and where there's political will to develop them. So it'll be a combination of domestic side, market interventions on pricing, but also to create a favorable environment to develop minds in some of these resource rich jurisdictions and the mobilization of entities like the DFC."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 320.453, "text": " Thank you.

That's the focus of tonight's angle. Now, finally, the leftist agitators masquerading as virtuous crusaders may finally be held accountable for the threats against ICE agents and ICE operations. Now, last night, we reported on Congressman Salud Carbajal's outrageous doxing of an ICE officer during a raid at a cannabis farm.  Now, that staffer was then sent to the ER with hand injuries after he was hit by a rock from a protester. Now, our point here, everybody involved in putting this officer's life in danger should be charged under 18 U.S.C. Section 111.  Otherwise, this is not going to stop. You can make it a conspiracy charge. Now, Section 111, which prohibits forcibly impeding, assaulting or interfering with certain federal staffers, is a serious crime. But we just learned that the DOJ is no longer playing nice here, dropping federal indictments against nine hard left activists early yesterday morning at their homes in Spokane, Washington.  Now, all charges involved alleged unlawful interference with ICE operations at a June 11th protest and involved more protests the day before yesterday. Now, here's what went down that led to these arrests.  repeatedly blocking ICE vehicles when ICE officials were inside and thus could not move. Now, the nine suspects are exactly what you'd expect and include Ben Stuckart, a former city council president.  And they got him for a conspiracy to impede or injure federal officers. Then there's Jack Archer, an organizer with Spokane Community Against Racism, otherwise known as SCAR. Same charges there. And Justice Forall, who is a perpetual organizer.  who sits on the Spokane Human Rights Commission. Same charges, including injury to an officer. Then there's Mickey Hatfield, same charges with an additional charge, including intent to cause another felony or use of a dangerous weapon. Then there's Bahun Mavalawala, the son of Mahawala Sr., who was the campaign manager for Bernadine Bank. She ran for Congressional District 5, House of Reps seat in 2024.  charged with conspiracy to impede or injure officers. Colin Muncy, same charges. Bobby Silva, more conspiracy to impede or interfere and with intent to cause physical contact or intent to cause another felony. Then these two Buttes, Thalia Ramirez and Aaron Lang, both charged with conspiracy to impede or injure officers.  Now, court documents show the federal grand jury found that the basis for the conspiracy charges includes the use of force or threats against and intimidation of federal agents. Again, in order to impede and thwart the processing and transport of federal detainees.  The suspects were held in US Marshals Lockup in the Federal Building. I love that, because nobody knew where they were, and they were not sure where to go to protest. So most were set to be released later today, but these charges are a start. Now, a local criminal defense attorney said he expected more people would be arrested on more serious charges.  Now, of course, rather than expressing shock at the alleged unlawful conduct, the local mayor, Lisa Brown in Spokane, does the opposite, calling it a politically motivated action and a perversion of our justice system and saying Trump's ICE is creating widespread fear across the community. Now, this is typical sanctuary mayor nonsense, putting illegals before Americans and the rule of law. And she talks about widespread fear,  What do you think the people of Spokane felt when Jose Efren Gonzalez Rodriguez, an illegal alien from Mexico, was sentenced to drug traffic and firearms charges? He was caught with more than 60,000 fentanyl pills and stolen weapons. Imagine how many people he killed. Now, literally, they think that you should suffer so they can celebrate illegal aliens. That's where we are in the United States.  Now, they may have the open borders Marxists on their side, but not most Americans. The new Harvard Harris poll shows huge support for deporting criminals. Look at these numbers. 93% of Republicans support it, 70% of independents, and even 59% of Democrats.  But it doesn't matter to elected Democrats because they're trying to rebuild their credibility among their radical base. They want to turn up the rhetoric, which will only endanger ICE and also law-abiding Americans. So it's all Nazi imagery all the time for the young punks like honorary squad member Max Frost.  They want more people behind bars. They want to incarcerate more people. And they want to ethnically cleanse this country of certain types of immigrants.

American activists embedded in local government, radical NGOs, and universities. If they're engaged in criminal activity, they should be charged and due time.  And speaking of academia, meet Jonathan Anthony Caravello, a math and philosophy prof at California State University in the Channel Islands. He was arrested last week by federal agents for allegedly throwing a tear gas container at ICE officers.  He'll be arraigned on August 1st. Of course, naturally, his school is standing by their man.

They're telling campaigns, if you can't handle these swashbucklers, now is a great time to retire. So who's going to save the Democrat Party from this ship of fools?  Here comes the great white hope, Captain Gavin Newsom. Barack told him to act tough, and Gavin's already cursing like a sailor. Mother. Noble. Believe that out of here, the son of a God gift despise me for the I read to Gavin state suffering from devastating fires and riots. So he left.  He went to South Carolina to kiss babies and do four-hour podcasts. Gavin's not officiating gay weddings anymore. He's talking to Navy SEALs and trying to act like one of the guys, but he keeps forgetting to uncross his legs. In the first few minutes, he talked about bowhunting, skeet shooting, and called the president a son of a bitch. And then he claims his hair caught on fire in the Palisades.  I was up there in the hills with these guys, and we all turned around when my hair literally burst on. There's a video of it. And they threw me in the car. The guy hits my hair and throws me in the car and says, get the fuck out of here. Gavin uses so much grease, the smallest spark turned him into Burning Man. We asked the governor's office to give us the video of him looking like Michael Jackson in a Pepsi commercial, but we haven't heard back. If anyone has the video of Gavin's hair going up in flames, text it to us. We want to see the tape.  Maybe he got sunburned and made a mistake. He says he's made a lot of them. What are some of the things during COVID that you think maybe were a mistake? We were concerned it was airborne and folks, you know, we were worried about people being outside even. And we realized then, after the fact, what the hell are we doing shutting down the beaches?  and open areas. Do you think that some of the restrictions that you put in place created a mental health crisis by being locked up, by not being able to enjoy the outdoors? It was devastating. Come on, man, of course. Newsom says he was wrong about lockdowns, and now he's saying he's wrong about sex changes for six-year-olds. Is eight years old too young? Yeah, I mean, look, I...  Now that I have a nine-year-old, it just became nine. Come on, man. I get it. So those are legit. You know, it's interesting, just the issue of age. I haven't, as I, you know,  as someone that's been so focused on equality, broadly, LGBT rights, particularly though gay marriage. The trans issue for me is also novel. It's over the last few years. I'm trying to understand as much as anyone else, whole pronoun thing. The whole pronoun thing. Once he got going, the governor couldn't stop talking about what his party was wrong about.  Do you feel like the last administration was divisive? I think, you know, we got ideological, you know. Failed at the border. And they've sent me two bills I've had to veto where they didn't want me to cooperate with ICE for these 11-plus thousand people. I just think they're wrong. My party's wrong on that. Newsom's running on Democrats being wrong on everything. Well, that's a great platform if you're a Republican, so good luck.  The governor even went a step further and said Democrats should wash their mouths out with soap. Because you oppose sports does not make you a bigot, doesn't make you homophobic. There are certain people that cannot stand the community, and, you know, that's different. But the vast majority of the folks I come into contact that think it's unfair are good human beings, and I think, um, we should treat them accordingly.  Well, Newsom better swallow a big bar of Irish spring. He called Trump disgusting, appalling, sick, misogynist, narcissist, racist, unfit, and delusional. And after that, Gavin says he loves Rogan, guns, and the red, white, and blue. Gotta show our pride and patriotism a little bit more, not be shy about it. We celebrate all this, but we don't celebrate what unites us.  United States of America, these enduring principles of our founding fathers, taking the best of Greek democracy and the Roman Republic, three independent, co-equal branches of government, the rule of law. What a gift. They were imperfect, but, man, what a God-gift to this country. We're about to celebrate 250th anniversary. Gavin has transitioned back into a man, and we're proud of him. Because before Gavin detransitioned, he sounded like this.  Black community does not need to change. We need to change. One thing is clear to me. We have a hierarchy of values in this country that diminishes certain people based on their color of the skin. A history, though, that must acknowledge the shameful mistakes of our country's past. After all, America was literally built on the backs of black people.  Newsom's America's first AI politician. His Silicon Valley donors figured out how to make an algorithm to make him electable outside of California. And after undergoing political sex change surgery, Gavin is now a patriotic anti-lockdown trans surgery pronoun and pro-border governor who loves capitalism, the second amendment and the founders. Would Gavin admit he was wrong about everything if he wasn't running for president?  Are you gearing up for a 2028 run? No. I'm blown away at the Democrats' obsession with just that sort of perfect person that's going to say, you know, sort of this John Wayne thing, this romantic version of that person's going to save the day. Meanwhile, we're not doing the hard work. The more Trump keeps doing what he does, the more compelled I am to think about it. I've never felt more outrage, more anger.  Gavin's leaving the door open to come out of the California closet and save the party from the pirates. He's basically running as a 57-year-old Joe Biden, a straight white male who isn't as crazy as the rest of the communists on the ship. But the way it's looking with this gnarly crew of identity pirates, they might make him walk the plank first, which might be a good thing if his hair is on fire.  Welcome to Hannity, and tonight the radical left is inconsolable. Their rage is completely out of control. On a positive note, they thankfully are no longer burning Teslas and attacking car dealerships. But unfortunately, and this is where it gets serious, they have a new target, federal immigration officials. Now attacks on ICE are up a whopping 830%. I wonder if it might have a little something to do with comments like these. Take a look.

Take a look.  The bottom line is Democrats are united."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1309.524, "text": "We are fighting the high costs that American people pay.

In reality, they're not unified at all. In fact, Schumer is a party leader in name only. Same with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Only in name only. As we speak, the Democratic Party, it is undergoing what is a scary transformation. Even Chuck Schumer himself is facing a possible primary.  If he does, he will lose. The truth is, melodramatic socialists are now ruling the Democratic Party with an iron fist. The establishment Democrats, people like Schumer, Jeffries, they are completely powerless, they are terrified, and they are paralyzed. AOC, the Squad, Jasmine Crockett, that's right, Comrade Bernie Sanders, and, oh, Pocahontas, they're all leading the way. But tonight, the rising star, the person stealing the spotlight,  Ah, an actual Marxist communist named Zoran Mamdani. As we affectionately like to refer to him on this program, Marxist Mamdani is the Democratic Party's nominee to be the next mayor of New York City. No wonder people are leaving in droves. Now, Mamdani has called for the government to seize the means of production.  Oh, confiscate private homes, set up government-run grocery stores. Grocery stores have a profit margin of 1 to 3 percent. He wants to defund the police, end cash bail, raise taxes, especially on people in, quote, whiter neighborhoods.  Hadn't heard that one before. And as an added bonus, Mamdani seemingly supports a global antifada against Jewish people. But like any good socialist, well, really Marxist-Statist, to each according to their need, from each according to their ability. It takes the New Green Deal, puts it on steroids and human growth hormone. When he runs out of other people's money, he knows just where to turn in his life. Mommy and Daddy. Take a look.  I think that the lack of matching funds makes class a major determinant in who can run and who can succeed when it comes to running for office. I worked until January, and then I took time away from my job. And one of the major reasons I could do so was because I knew that if I ran out of my savings, my family would be able to support me. And that is not a luxury that many people have.  Oh, Marxist Mamdani can run to mommy and daddy. He grew up in a world of privilege. His parents are ultra wealthy. Outside of a couple of years in local government, short stint as a rapper, Mamdani, this guy's never had a real job. Doesn't know how the real world works. Doesn't understand basic economics. Now he wants to run the wealthiest, the most complex city in the entire world. The once greatest city in the world is now becoming an atom.  Schiff hole. But don't expect Zora Mamdani to answer any tough questions. You know, if someone in the media would actually ask him something important, his campaign, they have a plan for that. Loud music. Interruption. Take a look. Thank you for your question."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1509.338, "text": "I think we're done here. We're going to go.

You know, we have Marxist Mamdani, would be a glaring disaster for the most, you know, publicized city in the entire world. He's not only Marxist, running to be the mayor of a big American city, this now radical socialist senator is now in the running to be in charge of Minneapolis.  This cancer is growing within Democratic Party radicalized ranks. This new radicalized Democratic Party, they're overjoyed, they are delusional. We're very happy for them. Already the entire party is underwater with Americans polling at a pretty low 40%, which is even lower than June. And get this, according to another poll, Kamala Harris, she is the frontrunner for 2028. I'll take that match any day of the week.  And to top it off, the congenital liar Adam Schiff, he's now being accused of mortgage fraud by the President of the United States. Didn't he get one of those preemptive pardons? Just wonder maybe what the reason might be. Anyway, at the very same time, the state-run legacy media mob continues to push deranged conspiracy theories about Donald Trump. What a shock. They live Trump. Trump lives in their head 24-7.  They can't help themselves at this point. If the dog bites, the bee stings, you're feeling sad, blame Trump, spread a conspiracy theory. Take a look. Do you worry about Donald Trump and Stephen Miller and some of these types monkeying around with the midterms and the way we do elections in this country? I mean, with what they're trying to pull these days, they don't want accountability. They don't want Democrats getting the gavels in the House and the Senate and be able to hold hearings and start impeachment proceedings and so on.  You worry about that, James? In a short word, yes. In the longer word, very. I think it's insane, honestly, to just assume we're going to have normal elections next year. I don't assume that.  Oh, fake news Acosta now believes in election integrity. Okay, Joy Reid, same thing. This is a delusional, insane group of people. Obama, by the way, is so panicked, he is now begging, literally, for Democrats to toughen up and quit their whining. And his former chief of staff, Rahm Rambo, Deadfish Emanuel, he's openly worried about the state of his own party, but he couldn't get elected. He'd probably be considered a moderate, which he's not. Take a look.  Just to give you a sense of how bad we are, the Democratic Party is less popular than Elon Musk right now. That should be like a wake-up call, how bad. The Democratic Party, we disappoint you. And I think if you look at these numbers, the Democrats are harder on the Democratic Party than others. And the reason is because they got disappointed. And they have every right to be disappointed in the leadership.  Now, a little advice from my Democratic friends. The constant whining from Democrats is less of a concern than the rampant extremism. They have socialism, communism, defunding the police, open borders, gender-affirming care for minors, taxpayer-funded sex change operations for illegals and for convicts, free college for illegals, coupled with, well, tampons in grade school boys' bathrooms. It's very deeply unpopular in the country.  and all for good reason.  Happy Tuesday, everyone. So according to a new poll, Kamala Harris is the front runner for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. She's up by 16 points and 16 pints. Meanwhile, Mayor Pete is in second place, which is quite a change for him since he isn't used to being behind a woman.  No, he's always leading. Politically, he's always ahead. Debbie Wasserman Schultz complained that alligator Alcatraz is making migrants brush their teeth where they poop. Many people point out that it's called a bathroom. Next thing they'll be accused of is heating up their food in the kitchen.  The country's largest teacher's union believes fighting Trump is more important than teaching reading and writing, claiming Trump is the worst thing to happen to America since Al Qaeda bombed the Titanic. Soft landing with that joke, huh? At a private fundraiser last week, Barack Obama told Democrats to quote, toughen up, which is the same thing Michelle says to him before strapping on the flesh hammer.  Still don't know what a flesh hammer is, but use your noggin. A Brazilian brothel introduced a 50% Trump tax on US customers. Although they claim there will be no taxes on just the tip. A rotting corpse was discovered in a white van in New York City. So that's where I left him, said one woman.  Single Disney fans are getting their own dating app. Fun fact, I went on it and they said I wasn't tall enough to ride any of the women.  Tori Spelling confessed that her ex-husband wanted her to role play as her Beverly Hills 90210 character Donna Martin in bed. That way when he puts the paper bag over her head, it's nothing personal. You know, I'm proud of that joke.  Finally, President Trump said he regrets having to use the same desk that Biden used in the Oval Office. But it's a lot more fun when someone is under it, said one man. So Democrats like Stacey Abrams are calling Trump an autocrat, protesting his illegal behavior. Of course, she's doing it while brazenly violating elevator weight limits.  But talk about a contrast. Trump's being called an autocrat based on imaginary claims from Democrats, while the left ignores what the Biden White House did in reality. Right now, Joe wants to convince us that he was behind those part and signed with the auto pen. When even he can't convince us, he can put on his own pants.  But the ex-pres rose from his coffin for 10 minutes with the New York Times and said he granted all pardons orally. Didn't Bill Clinton get impeached for that? Yeah. Now Biden claims he made every decision, which sounds like the cuck that's holding the camera when his wife's being banged by another guy. Oh, I wanted this. That's a great analogy and I don't care.  But at least the Times didn't take his word for it. They added, Biden did not individually approve each name he and aides confirmed. And instead, he signed off on the standards used to determine which convicts would qualify. His team then took care of the details and slammed it through with Autopen, with his chief of staff giving the final go ahead.  But you can't use Autopen without the president's consent. And do we really think he was able to give that? He was more out of it than Bill Cosby's dates. Ooh. Bill Cosby fans.  So what are these standards that they used? Out of the 25 documents Biden signed, two granted pardons to thousands, including criminals, murderers, and child abusers. Those standards were so low, Charles Manson wishes he was alive to qualify. The kids for cash judge sent children to prison in exchange for kickbacks, including one young man who later killed himself. Joe commuted his sentence, probably while watching Transformers 2 and his PJs.  One ghoul sexually assaulted and murdered two young girls, then murdered another woman. Biden commuted his sentence too. So how would you feel if your president let your family members kill her off death row? And how would you feel if it turned out the president's just a drooling vegetable and some unelected bureaucrat actually made that decision?  The Times also reports that Biden gave oral decisions at meetings, but the assistants who wrote down Joe's decisions, they weren't in the room when he made them. So you're saying Joe's inner circle wasn't making the calls and you're telling me we should take the Biden White House's word for it after all the gaslighting they and the media put us through? We're talking about the president who needed to be tased to wake him up from an afternoon nap.  I get it, it's true, other presidents have used auto pen before, Obama did, Trump used it. It's usually used for responding to letters, like when I used mine to answer Geraldo's request for money. So is the auto pen, I think, maybe one of the biggest scandals we've had in 50 to 100 years? Right, Mr. P? The auto pen, I think, is maybe one of the biggest scandals that we've had in  50 to 100 years, this is a tremendous scandal. And I know the people on the other side of the, see that desk, that resolute desk, unfortunately he used it before me. I guarantee he knew nothing about what he was signing. I guarantee it. Yeah, the pardon power is the president's most absolute and Biden abused it like Dr. Jill abused him.  So do we just say, well, that was terrible. I hope it never happens again. No, you don't do that with crime. You punish the crime. It's why I've got a lifetime ban from the Planet Fitness steam room. I can't be the only one who pees on the sauna rocks. So we need to investigate and cancel everything that Biden wasn't aware of. Biden might've signed off on some horrible crimes, but it would be a worse crime if we did the same.  But this veiled process leaves more questions than answers. So we went right to the source. Joining us now is the individual at the center of this scandal, Otto Penn. Thanks for being with us, Otto Penn. My first question.  Who's telling you what to sign? Who's telling me what to sign? Oh, the ball points on this guy. No one, Greg. How did you get this show? I have broken crayons I know funnier than you. Oh, you know, I hear you used to date my sister until she wanted someone bigger, so she switched to a golf pencil. Wow.  I thought maybe you were going to have some actual answers to these questions and not just insult me. Why did you pardon so many bad criminals? I wanted to get back at people who keep treating me like some sort of lowlife, Greg. You know, sucking on me to quit smoking, using me to write third eye blind lyrics. Rock bottom was when they had me signing Jesse Waters packages from him.  So now that Biden's out of office, what are you going to be signing now? Mostly bad checks, permission slips, forging life insurance for people about to get murdered. Just once, I'd like to sign Dolly Parton's boobs. I'd probably run out of ink, though, if you know what I mean. Well, thank you, Otto Penn, for not enlightening us on this scandal. Welcome, Greg. Bye-bye.  Let's welcome tonight's guest. He now owns a soccer team, making him even more boring. Host of Fox and Friends and One Nation, Brian Kilmeade. She talks so fast her tonsils are sponsored by NASCAR. Co-host of Outnumbered, Emily Campagna. He looks like the guy who goes to rehab to sell more drugs, comedian Adam Hunter.  And her audience went from Alice in Chains to Life Alert bracelets. Host of Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Kennedy. Brian, I know this is hard for you to kind of imagine because no one ever asks you for your signature. What do you think is going on with the auto pen and can this be undone?  Well, we're going to get there. But I think first is panic. Yeah. When that doctor showed up last week and took the fifth, when asked about his cognitive test and when did you know about the cancer, he would not answer a question. And then his assistant showed up and answered some questions, except for ones which said, did you ever have to wake him up? So he had to quickly pick up the phone and call the New York Times. First time he's done that in four years to say, I did everything.  And then little by little, it comes out he did nothing. It reveals that he had other people deciding what he roughly shaped would be a series of pardons to the tune of 4,000. So there's nothing adding up here. And once again, Joe Biden made things worse by speaking. And here's the question. What did he actually do? And it brings me to you. Yes.  Because people look at your monologue and they say it's so funny, it's so insightful, it's so you. But no one's ever seen you in the writing room, no one's ever seen you on a conference call. We see you in the hall, you're not funny. There is some scandal here that has yet to bubble up. And that's why I think you're so aggressively pursuing the auto pen story. That's my story. How dare he?  I think we know why Steve Doocy moved to Florida. Emily, you are a hot, sexy lawyer, which makes me wonder if you actually ever practiced law. Give us the legal ramifications. Is this all going to end with just a bunch of us whining? Or will something actually happen to this?

The business of lending hedge funds cash and securities to help execute their trades has seen explosive growth in recent years. Our finance reporter Will Shaw joins us now for more. Will, good morning. Why has prime brokerage been growing so fast and what's the backdrop to all of this?  Yeah, so basically, just to explain the growth, first of all, revenue from Prime has grown faster than any other product within equities trading in the past five years. Last year, income hit a record $27.7 billion, according to data from Chrysler, Coalition, Greenwich, and they're expecting even higher in 2025, potentially breaching $30 billion.  And so that essentially comes amid a rapid growth in multi-strat hedge funds, the likes of Millennium and Citadel around the world, which need more resources in order to trade.

The French firm BNP Paribas, for example, brought in more than 1.5 billion in revenue last year from its prime business. That was up 40% from the year before, and it gained a bigger market share than any of its rivals.  So they, for example, have got about 500 coders all working to try and make the business as efficient as possible. Bank of America is trying to break into the top three by expanding its offering. And JPMorgan, one of the big ones, they made more than $4 billion last year. They're now pushing into Asia-Pacific, looking at opportunities in Vietnam and Saudi, for example, building out infrastructure in India and China.  So what do regulators make about all of this then, particularly given the collapse of Archegos that only happened a few years ago?  Yeah, so nearly four years ago, Archegos Capital Management collapsed, inflicting devastating damage on its prime brokers, ultimately paving the way for the collapse of Credit Suisse. So regulators, as you would expect, are looking at this quite closely. In Europe, the European Securities and Markets Authority has warned that hedge funds active there are running bets with 18 times leverage and saying there's a risk of disproportionate reaction to unexpected events. I should say, though, that the regulators  are vigilant and keeping an eye on this situation, there's no suggestion that they're panicking or that they expect any kind of catastrophe in the immediate term."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1051.012, "text": "So then who are the ideal prime customers then from the bank's point of view?

They really like the big hedge funds, like the ones I mentioned earlier, and they're focusing a lot of resources on them. That's made it harder for smaller hedge funds to establish  relationships with prime brokers, there's also a risk that you can get a prime broker as a hedge fund within two years, then you're not making enough money for your bank and you find yourself unceremoniously ditched. So there's a series of smaller prime brokers like Clear Street Jones Trading, firms like that, that are popping up to take advantage of this and start servicing the smaller firms.

So if you look at the actual biggest contributors, and then let me add one more thing, is that if you look at the core CPI number, it came in below expectations. It came in at only 0.2. And so you're right, when you start annualizing the CPI number for the period during which President Trump has been in office, that number is coming in at or below the Fed's target inflation rate. And when you then compare that to where the Fed has interest rates right now,  You know, it does cause you to question whether or not the Fed's in the right spot, given where the inflation is at under the Trump administration.

By the way,  Putin's response to the things, to what was said on Monday, was another massive drone and missile strike on Ukraine to include Kiev. So he's staying fairly consistent in that. So a little bit more clear-eyed. I have to tell you, it's been a little bit of a roller coaster since this thing came out. As of last night, it sounded, based on what was reported, that he might have been almost encouraging  President Zelensky to target Moscow and St. Petersburg. One could interpret what he was saying in that way. Certainly as of this morning, it certainly sounded that way. And then throughout the course of the day, it started to shift. And he's saying, oh, no, you know, he shouldn't target Moscow. And I don't know if there was something else that was said between him, between President Trump and Putin.  or if there was something said between intermediaries or something like that. But he did seem to be backing off of that. Now, there is a missile that is a longer range missile that can be fired from a high Mars. We haven't even shared this missile with our closest NATO allies yet.  but it is something that would give them about 500 kilometer range. And when he talks about targeting Moscow, St. Petersburg, I think that's a system he's thinking about now, but what Zelensky can do and what Ukraine can do, and they have been doing as they can easily target Moscow with drones. And they've been doing that. They've been hitting places much further out with long range drones, but those drones are very susceptible to air defense.

And then throw in rates with President Trump and Jerome Powell and all the noise that comes with that.  And it just continues to cause uncertainty. Personally, I don't think we see inflation skyrocketing by any stretch. I think even this past monthly number, you had some things that were more tariff sensitive, such as apparel rise, but you had that offset by reductions in car prices and airlines.  So I think we're just sort of going to bounce around here in this range. But, you know, the bottom line, it was up. I don't think anybody was surprised by that. It was in line with expectations.

We want to turn to Washington now and politics, where the Trump administration is under pressure to release more documents in connection to Jeffrey Epstein. The growing frustrations coming from within Trump's own MAGA base. Here's NBC's Kelly O'Donnell with the details.  New tonight, the MAGA movement's push for public disclosure of the Justice Department's files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein now includes a high-profile Trump ally. I'm for transparency. House Speaker Mike Johnson. It's a very delicate subject, but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it.  A push for damage control from the president's own daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. I do think that there needs to be more transparency on this. And I think that that will happen. Earlier today, Attorney General Pam Bondi tried to deflect Epstein questions. Nothing about Epstein. I'm not going to talk about Epstein. Reporters pressed her on new comments today from President Trump, suggesting Bondi consider opening some files.  She's handled it very well, and it's going to be up to her. Whatever she thinks is credible, she should release. The president said today you would release credible files related to Mr. Epstein. Are you prepared to do that, and when would you? Our memo today, our memo speaks for itself. And we'll get back to you on anything else. That DOJ memo said it found no incriminating client list, no credible evidence of blackmail, and therefore, no further disclosure.  That stunned some Trump supporters, because she had said this in February, when asked about a client list. It's sitting on my desk right now to review. Then her push to clarify. My response was, it's sitting on my desk to be reviewed, meaning the file, along with the JFK, MLK files as well. That's what I meant by that.  The controversy lit a political wildfire in MAGA World. Make some noise if you care about the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.  Kelly O'Donnell joins us tonight from the White House. Kelly, I'm going to use your own words there, a political wildfire. You know, some viewers may be confused. Since the election, nearly all the Republicans that have been elected, and of course, the Trumps have always stood by President Trump. This seems to be, you know, both Lara Trump and then Speaker Johnson basically saying what a lot of, you know, Republican voters want for the Epstein files to be released, while President Trump is sort of trying to tamp this down. So why is there a mixed message there?  Well, it's an interesting time. Just a short time ago, the president has just returned to the White House. He spoke with reporters, and he was asked about why his supporters are so interested in the Epstein files. And he said he honestly doesn't understand it. He called it an old case. He doesn't know why they're so drawn to it. But he did say, repeating but perhaps emphasizing more something he said earlier that was in our piece, that anything credible, they should have it.  To me, Tom, that sounds like the White House is opening that door for Pam Bondi, the attorney general, to do more if she finds some material credible. Remember, some of what's believed to be in the files includes things that might be considered private witness material, some child pornography, which would not be made public. But is there anything credible the president tonight says the people should have it?  All right, big new developments there and a lot of new reporting from Kelly. Kelly, we thank you for that.

Now to power in politics and the latest on the controversy over President Biden's use of an auto pen. House Republicans are investigating Biden's cognitive state during his time in office, alleging he may not have been aware of what was being signed on his behalf using the device. But NBC News has learned that Congressman James Comer, the Kentucky Republican leading that investigation, has himself used a digital signature to sign some letters and subpoena notices connected to the probe.  a spokeswoman for the House Oversight Committee, which Comer chairs, rejected that comparison. We're joined tonight by Ryan Nobles, our Chief Capitol Hill Correspondent, who reported out the story for NBC. Ryan, thanks for being here tonight. Walk us through how you were able to determine that these documents were signed with a digital signature for Comer. And what is the distinction here he's been making between what he did and what he alleges President Biden did? Because Republicans are really pushing back on this.  Yeah, they are, Tom. And to be clear, we're not alleging that Congressman Comer did anything wrong in this process, but we are pointing out the process in which this played out. And we noticed in the 16 letters that he sent out to targets of this investigation that our former Biden White House officials investigating this idea that somehow the use of an auto pen by the former president was inappropriate, that in these letters, it was a digital signature that was affixed  to every single one of them, meaning he did not sign them himself and said it was a picture of his signature that was put in by a member of his staff. Now, Comer's office tells us that this is common practice and it was actually used as a result of some of the subpoena notices that went out during the January 6th Select Committee's investigation. And that is kind of the point here.  that this is a widespread practice that's used both in Congress, in the legislative branch, and in the executive branch as well. The distinction that Comer's investigation is trying to demonstrate is that somehow it means that President Biden did not authorize the things that were signed in his name. That is, of course, something that the former president has flatly rejected. He has said that he knew and was  and authorized every single decision that was made that he ended up signing or having someone sign on his behalf. And at this point, the committee, the House Oversight Committee that's responsible for this, has yet to demonstrate specific evidence that would show that someone else made a decision that ultimately was authorized by a signature of Joe Biden's.  And then, Ryan, while we have you here, we do want to ask you, House Republicans have been insisting that Biden may not have been aware or making the final calls on clemency during the presidency. Have they presented any evidence for that so far?  That is what they say they are in search of when I asked specific questions about the status of this investigation. That's why they say they are bringing in all these former Biden White House officials to ask very specific questions about when decisions were made and then when the call was made to use some version of an auto pen or a signature that wasn't directly by the president's hand himself. At this point, if they have  found that evidence. If something has come up during one of these interviews that would allude to that, they have yet to present it. They say they're still in the early stages of this investigation. But ultimately, the premise that they're working under is that this auto pen, which we should point out was really first presented by the current President Donald Trump as an issue, is going to lead them to that ultimate conclusion. But it's clear they haven't gotten there yet.  OK, Ryan Noble, it's always great to have you on Top Story. Ryan, we thank you for that.

Steven Roman, NBC News.  All right, time now for Top Stories Health Check. A new study finding the use of weight loss drugs in kids has skyrocketed. Take a look at this. The study found that prescribing GLP-1s for weight management in kids aged 8 to 17 increased 65% after the American Academy of Pediatrics issued guidelines recommending them two and a half years ago.  To help us understand what this all means, I want to bring in Dr. Tanya Altman. She's a pediatrician and founder of Calabasas Pediatrics Wellness Center. Doctor, thanks so much for joining Top Story tonight. Obviously, this was a recommendation by trusted pediatricians, but how young is too young for kids to go on these drugs?  Hi, Tom. Thank you for having me on. I mean, I think it's really a case-by-case basis. The youngest in my practice is nine, but we look at other factors besides just their weight. Do they have type 2 diabetes? Are they headed to that, you know, type 2 diabetes based on their labs? Do they have fatty liver, high blood pressure, high cholesterol?  Many of these kids have already been working with a dietician and an exercise instructor for a long time and we've been talking to them and really working with the family to try to get them to lose weight and nothing's working. So it takes this team approach and now we have this other tool which is a shot and let me just tell you that kids don't always want weekly shots too. So they have to be motivated as well to add this into the regimen.  What are the concerns about putting kids this young? I mean, you just mentioned nine years old. You're obviously a trained professional. What is the concern about getting kids on these drugs so young? Or maybe there aren't concerns. But I mean, as a parent, I got to tell you, it sort of stood out to me.  Yeah, I mean, I think you have to have a child with obesity and other medical issues to often really understand why sometimes this medication is needed. But I have to say that I have seen such a great improvement in my kids. Like, for example, think about a child who's in school and they're constantly 24-7 thinking about food and their next meal.  and they're eating a cafeteria tray size for lunch, as opposed to regular portion sizes. So we start them on the medication, and then it shrinks down to their eating normal portion sizes. We're teaching them about healthy eating. They're able to focus on their math, and their reading, and their exercises, and their friends, and have a more normal, healthy lifestyle. So I think in the long run, this is gonna be a great tool to really help decrease all of those medical complications we often see from obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol issues.  But she just said it there, in the long run, does this mean they're gonna be on these drugs their entire life? So that's a great question, and you know, it is still new, so I think we don't know. A lot of the experts, when I go to these meetings, you know, there are some kids where we see and we hope that this can sort of reset their satiety center, because the medication works by not only slowing down your gut motility, so you stay fuller longer, but it also helps with the insulin and blood sugar, keeping them more stabilized in your body.  but it also helps reset that satiety center in your brain so you're not constantly thinking about food. And in my practice, that's often been one of the most surprising benefits, that the kids come to me and they say, wow, Dr. Tanya, I actually can now focus on my schoolwork. I can think about other things. I'm not always wondering when my next meal is going to be there. Dr. Tanya, thank you. Very, very insightful into this topic, which I think a lot of people are going to be talking about.  We're back now with Top Stories Global watching a check on international headlines. Hungary, India, and Poland officially completed their first crewed missions to the International Space Station. Video showing the four-person crew inside a SpaceX capsule splashing down in Southern California waters and taking their first steps back on Earth.  The aerospace company Axiom launched the mission, the first time the three nations sent astronauts to the ISS. They were joined by American astronaut Peggy Whitson, the mission commander who holds the record for cumulative days in space at 675. And a typhoon bringing heavy rain and flooding near Japan's Mount Fuji. Look at this. Typhoon Nari turning streets into rivers and disrupting traffic in a town near the famous peak.  The storm made landfall as a low-pressure system dumping six inches of rain in 24 hours. The system is the first tropical storm to hit the region since 2016. A stolen ancient Roman mosaic was returned to Pompeii more than 80 years after it was stolen by a Nazi officer during World War II. The priceless work depicting a couple in bed dates as far back as the first century B.C.  During World War II, a German Nazi officer stationed in Italy took the piece, gifting it to a civilian who kept it until his death. His heirs contacted Italian authorities, arranging the return. The mosaic is set to be displayed alongside items recovered from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the ancient city. Thank you for watching. I'm Tom Yamas in New York. Stay right there.

Still, Democrats won't help. They've changed and added a small amount on the foreign aid proposal, but it still leaves an enormous vacuum that China and Russia will fill. Republicans say silencing public broadcasting is long overdue. North Dakota Public Radio, about 26% of their budget is federal funded.  To me, that's more of an indictment than it is a need. There's a race for the Senate and House to pass the same bill by a Friday night deadline. But the Senate changes could complicate that. We wanted them to pass it unaltered, as we did.

Why did this plan to consider cryptocurrency bills blow up in the House today?  Well, nine Republicans rebelled to block the House from debating a trio of crypto bills today. Conservatives say the plan did not go far enough, barring the Fed from creating its own cryptocurrency. And Bitcoin fell by 3% in trading today. Brett? Chad Berkham live on The Hill. Chad, thanks. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is here. All right, Mr. Secretary, what's been going on behind the scenes with this economic engine?  Well, you've got more than $15 trillion of committed investment coming into America. So we know the economy is going to be on fire. You know it. Plus, you've got the tariff revenue pouring in. So Donald Trump is feeling very, very strong. And that strength is going to show up in his trade deals. So what he said to Indonesia today was very simple.  Open your whole market, and I mean open it. No tariffs, no trade barriers, and you can only pay us 19%. Think about Donald Trump. He's opening markets for our businesses to export, and he's earning us 19% to pay down our debt. I mean, he is fixing the trade deficit point by point.  All right, so we'll be able to have Fox News pumped into Indonesia so every single person in that country can watch Jesse Waters' primetime.  Exactly. That's exactly it. And we're going to do that. We've got it in Vietnam so far. You're already in the UK. So that's good. But we've got lots of deals. All right. Good. Lots of deals on the table. And it's up to the president to decide which ones he wants to do and which ones does he want to press the pedal to the metal and add more heat to the fire. But that's really on his desk. And that's what he's dealing with every day right now.  All right, so we got a huge AI arms race, Mr. Secretary. The other day, I saw a robot walking through San Francisco. I think he was jaywalking. But how soon are we going to see these things take over? Everyone's talking about AI.  Well, look, AI is going to help us create advanced manufacturing in America, right? So we're bringing in all these trillions of dollars of investment, and we're gonna need five million workers to build these factories and work in these plants, the AI plants, the fabs for semiconductors, the pharmaceuticals, they're all coming home, and we need automated plants to help us because, let's face it,  Those 5 million people, we've got 5 million people to go to work in these factories. We don't have 50 million. So we need the automation to take this $15 trillion and really reshore manufacturing back to America. And when are we going to start cutting these ribbons on these big, big investment projects? We've got a lot of great announcements, a lot of money, but when do they break ground?  Oh I get invited to these things all the time. I mean if I went to these ribbon cuttings. So basically what's happening now is they're starting to move dirt. Right. They're clearing fields. They're doing dirt. They had micron which went to 200 billion dollar investment in in memory band with you know semiconductor memory.  building in Boise, Idaho, just job after job, factory after factory. They're coming, and they're coming now. So I would say one year from today, you're going to see more than 1% GDP growth just from Donald Trump's plans of bringing in these factories. And building these factories in America is going to add more than 1% GDP growth in a year. All right, we want to see these factories more than we wanted to see those Biden electric car charging stations. He only built seven.  So let's see if we can beat that, Mr. Secretary. Good to see you. Thank you so much.  Welcome back from the big, beautiful bill to the next stage in President Trump's plan to save taxpayer cash, turning spending cuts from doge into law. The Senate set to take up a rescissions package this week that would claw back around $9 billion in federal spending. The House approved the bill back in June. They approved $9.4 billion in rescission cuts. That's what was asked for by the White House. The Senate, though, just made some changes to the package.  In a moment, we're going to head back to the House. We're going to head back to the Senate in a moment and get a little bit of insight on why they carved out some $400 million from the ask from President Trump. But let's have a quick refresher on exactly the terms we're talking about and how one goes about putting together spending packages. First, Trump's big, beautiful bill was passed through the reconciliation process. That's a special legislative  process designed to speed up changes in spending and tax policy, but only spending and tax policy. It is essentially somewhat of a budgeting mechanism that allows the House and the Senate to pass legislation with only a simple majority, 51 senators, for example, to pass  a reconciliation bill. But then what is, therefore, rescissions? Well, simply put, it's the cancellation of previously approved government funding. Rescissions are proposed by the president, as I mentioned, forwarded by the White House over to Congress, approved by Congress. It's the kind of spending cuts that Doge went through with a fine-tooth comb and suggested  to the present. Now, when it comes to the $9 billion in cuts on this rescissions package, what are we talking about specifically? Well, this is the Senate's proposal. $7.9 billion in cuts to USAID and other foreign assistance programs, and $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which runs NPR and PBS.  That adds up to a little less than the $9.4 billion the House and the White House wants to cut. Republican lawmakers are staring down, by the way, a deadline of Friday to get this measure to President Trump's desk. So where does this all stand? Joining me now is Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, who's also a member of the Budget Committee. Senator, thanks for being with us here today. I think let's start with the $9 billion package that's rumored to be  coming out of the Senate. First of all, does that even have the votes in the Senate? Can you get 51 senators to approve $9 billion in cuts? Well, I'm embarrassed to say I don't know. We had a, excuse me, we had a luncheon meeting today. OMB Director Russ Vogt came over and tried to explain the bill.  I was pretty discouraged after the meeting. I would describe the meeting as organized grab-ass. I mean, a million questions of Russ, a lot of whining. You know, put this in context. The president's asking us to reduce spending by $9 billion. Yeah, that's a lot of money, but that's one-tenth of 1 percent of the budget.  And the spending he's asking us to cut is stuff like $3.6 million for male prostitutes in Haiti, $3 million to buy condoms in Zambia, $500,000 to buy electric buses for Rwanda, just a bunch of spending poor.  And I have listened to my Republican colleagues. I love them all. But I have listened to them for years, and certainly for the last 100 days, since President Trump was elected, talk about the need to reduce spending,  And here we are on the verge of the vote, and I don't know if it's going to pass. But I know this much, after listening to all of this rhetoric about we need to reduce spending, if every Republican doesn't vote for it, we ought to hide our head in a bag, man. It's embarrassing.  I share your embarrassment, Senator. I actually think it's even embarrassing to ask for the trim from the $9.4 billion that the House and the White House have forwarded over to Congress. If the Senate can only come back with $9 billion, saving $400 million for, I don't know, AIDS programs in Africa seems to be the hang-up at the moment. I think that would be somewhat embarrassing for the Senate.  And I don't know who we're talking about, Senator. Collins, Murkowski, McConnell, Tillis. I don't know who we're talking about. But that would be embarrassing, much less it would be complete travesty to not even be able to get, as you point out, one-tenth of 1% of federal spending approved to cut.  Well, yes, the bill has been reduced by $400 million. I don't know why. I sat next to Eric Schmidt at lunch. He's handling the bill. All I know is that to make one senator happy, he had to reduce the spending cut by $400 million.  And I got to tell you, Will, I'm tired of paying bribes to people to do the right thing. The last \u2014 the reconciliation bill, we got it passed, but it was nauseating. I'll tell you what I learned from that reconciliation process and all the bribes that we had to pay. In the real world, pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered. In the United States Senate, pigs just get fatter.  And if they start having to bribe senators to vote for this bill, I'm off this train. I'm not going to take a bullet train to Chumptown. Now, this is very... What does that mean? That means that this stuff is very reasonable. The president is asking us to cut spending porn. And I'm going to raise fresh hell if they have to start reducing it even more to bribe senators to get them to vote. I just... I'm sick of it.  Well, it'll be refreshing to hear that hell that is raised, because one thing we don't want to hear more about is senators that talk the good game on deficit and debt problems and then vote to save $400 million headed over to Africa, or can't even put together one-tenth of 1% of our federal spending. It is certainly, maybe not a surprise, but certainly enlightening.  Well, what you do is what you believe, and everything else is just cottage cheese. We're about to find out what some people believe and who supports spending porn and who doesn't.  All right, Senator Kennedy, we'll be watching, as you point out. And we watch him for that fresh hell. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Also breaking tonight, President Trump says the US is ahead of China in artificial intelligence, despite what others may be claiming.

Jackie, thank you. It's a good time to check in on not just the two parties and what's happening in America in politics, but also to look at what Elon Musk has talked about. He has proposed a third way, a third party, the American party. My next guest has been involved in third party politics. He was helped behind the scenes with Ross Perot. He is CEO of Maslansky Partners. It's Michael Maslansky. Michael, thanks for being with us here today. It's interesting where we sit today.  with the two parties first to start. It's going very well right now, objectively so on the economic front, even on the front of international affairs for Republicans. And that's left Democrats looking for some really extreme champions.  Yeah, I mean, I think that's true. Thanks for having me, Will. I think right now it is tough for the Democrats to come up with any message or any person at this point to represent a different perspective. I think what that doesn't necessarily change is the percentage of Americans that are angry with, fed up with, frustrated with the two parties that we've got today, which creates the opening for somebody like Elon Musk to step in with a third party.  You know, I think that's interesting, Michael, in that people often check that box when it comes to a poll. They don't like the two parties. But I think that's often a rejection, at least socially and conversationally, of the idea of being boxed in to being a partisan. They want to be independent. They want to have their own ideas. And maybe they want a third option. But history, as you well know when it comes to the candidacy of Ross Perot, hasn't embraced the idea of a third party. So would it be different for Elon Musk and the American party?  Well, I think you're absolutely right that the idea of launching a successful third party or a third party effort has proven to be extremely difficult. I think what we see in polling is that third parties are much more popular until you put somebody at the top of a campaign. And then all of a sudden, when they have to be for things as opposed to being against things, it tends to divide people.  And so I think two things can be true. It can be that there is a lot of desire for that kind of perfect candidate in the middle that doesn't represent either what the right is offering or what the left is offering, and the kind of elusiveness of actually finding that candidate or group of candidates in a party to fit that bill.  I sort of reject that analysis, Michael, not to debate you or to say that you're wrong. I just think that people often pretend that they're in the middle. We always want to act like there's some kind of compromise candidate that might actually get our vote. But in real time, we're watching President Donald Trump redefine what it means to be a Republican, embracing policies that in the past have been championed by Democrats, whether or not that's tariffs  or dovishness when it comes to an approach on foreign policy, or at least less interventionist when it comes to foreign policy. So I don't think Americans ask for someone who's sort of lukewarm. They just ask for someone who is unique and independent and represents their views. And I don't know. Perhaps Ross Perot represented that at one time, at least to some degree of Americans. I don't know that that could be represented by Elon Musk.  So here's where I'd push back on you a little bit, in that the candidates that we've seen, even President Trump, a majority of the population, more people voted for him than the other side, more people voted for him than ever before, but it wasn't a majority.  There is a majority of people who tend to vote against any given candidate, and it is based on the fact that they have not found the candidate that they want to vote for. I will say either of those things being true, Elon Musk is not going to be the solution, because the message that he's bringing to the table so far with his America Party  First of all, even assuming that he's trying to create a party as opposed to just tear down President Trump at this point, the message that he's bringing is not one that is likely to bring any significant percentage of the population to the table to vote kind of for something as opposed to just against it.  I've seen you write about that, that you have to offer up what you're for, not just what you're against. You have to have inspirational language that guides people to you, not simply academic language. And I think you're right on that when it comes to communication styles. I think that we need to measure the moment. And the moment is that the United States happens to be doing very well right now, regardless of the sort of hyperventilation about Donald Trump. And he right now is representing  the most diverse and unique political coalition in my lifetime, and perhaps over the last 100 years in American politics. It's kind of hard to launch a third party or define yourself as a Democrat when you're in the midst of a total, total iconoclast redefining American politics. And that's right now, Donald Trump. Michael, it's good conversation, though. I appreciate you being here. Thanks for having me, Will.  All right, we can report tonight that the Trump economy is now firing on all cylinders, adding on to the already historic levels of investment and committed investments, over $10 trillion in the U.S. that he has been able to secure. President Trump announced a $92 billion energy and innovation investment in Pennsylvania. Take a look.  We're back in Pittsburgh to announce the largest package of investments in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and it's not even close. I don't imagine it's too close. I don't think second is too close. That's a big statement. This afternoon, 20 leading technology and energy companies are announcing more than $92 billion of investments in Pennsylvania.  And the good news, it didn't stop there. Rolls-Royce announcing a $75 million investment to expand their South Carolina plant, and minor MP material stocks soared following the huge announcement of a $500 million deal, a half a billion dollar deal with Apple today for rare earth minerals that will reinforce Apple's US supply chain. By the way, that's smart and good. President Trump also announced a quote, great deal with Indonesia,  After threatening a 32% tariff, and after months of frustration over the Fed Chair Jerome Powell's absolute refusal to lower interest rates, the Treasury Secretary Scott Besson said the formal process to find his replacement has now begun. He can't leave soon enough. Donald Trump put out today, Fed should cut rates by three points, very low inflation, $1 trillion would be saved.  Despite the strong economic news, Democrats want to hyperventilate over, quote, the inflation report, which is 2.7 percent. Oh, far below the out-of-control numbers we saw under Biden and Harris. Where was the mainstream liberal state-run media mob then?  Democrats also shockingly forgot to mention core consumer prices rose less than expected for a fifth straight month. Here with reaction is the host of Kudlow on our sister station, the Fox Business Network. Larry Kudlow is with us. Here's my perspective.  Largest tax cut in American history. I'm a supply-sider. Reagan dropped the top marginal rate from 70% to 28%. Revenues doubled. I believe when you cut taxes, it increases revenues. It doesn't decrease. I do believe you need to get spending under control, too. Put that aside. Add to that the president's commitment towards energy dominance. We can be an energy-rich country.  10, now moving towards $11 trillion, trillion with a T, in committed money in manufacturing for semiconductor chips, which we need to build here, pharmaceuticals, which we need to be manufactured here, automobiles, which, again, will be manufactured here. The president's announcements today. I see the foundation now completely set for incredible economic growth, probably within a year. I hope I'm right. You're the expert. Am I or am I not?  I think you're right on target. Look, this was a supply side, big, beautiful bill, tax cuts, plenty of incentives to invest in America, deregulation, more energy production. I mean, what you saw in Pittsburgh was fabulous, a combination of technology companies and energy companies. You know, it's a terrific thing. If we had a decent governor in New York, we might have the same thing.  But I want to talk about the CPI, Sean, just for a second, because you've got all these lefty media types trying to hit Trump over the head with something called tariff inflation. And then they're covering up for all the mistakes and mismanagement of Jay Powell at the Fed. So look, Trump's been president five months. Since January, the consumer price index is up 1.8%.  at an annual rate. That is a terrific number. One point eight percent. All right. Joe Biden cumulatively had 20 percent when he was president. All right. So why is the Fed target rate at four and a half, which is over twice what the actual inflation rate is? Crazy. It should come down. The president is exactly right. That should have lowered it. The other thing I want to say is, you know, tariff inflation. OK, so bear with me.  Yes, some items are affected by tariffs and the prices have gone up, okay? Household furnishing being one, computers being another. But Sean, here's what fell in this report, and no one's reporting this, okay? Used cars down, new cars down, airline fares down. They all fell, their prices. Eggs down, okay? Snacks down.  hotel and motel prices down, milk down, butter down, cereals down. I mean, come on. There's no tariff inflation here."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1607.941, "text": "I'm sorry.

And that's the subject of the riff. So Wall Street Journal and New York Times out with screaming headlines that today's small 0.3% rise in the CPI, Consumer Price Index, should be blamed on Trump's tariffs.  The Times called it US inflation accelerated in June as Trump's tariffs pushed up prices. The Wall Street Journal called it inflation picks up to 2.7% as tariffs start to keep and seep into prices. So I'm going to say at the start, this is nonsense baloney. The lefty media is using tariff hysteria to cover up Jay Powell's gross mismanagement and frame Trump. The report shows no such thing.  Newspapers, on the other hand, along with most of the media, love to blame every little piece of even quasi-bad news on Trump's tariffs. Now, actually, since January, the CPI has increased only a low 1.8% at an annual rate, which is less than the Fed's 2% target. The core CPI increased 2.1% over the same period.  And Mr. Trump's supply-side-oriented One Big Beautiful Bill, with its pro-growth tax cuts and deregulation, hasn't even taken effect yet. There's a productivity boom out there that will also curb inflation. And also, during Mr. Trump's first five months, blue-collar wages have risen much faster than prices, a welcome relief from Bidenflation. But back to the CPI.  The 12-month change looks higher because a year ago the index was flat, 0.0. That's the luck of the draw. Also, the 1% jump in gasoline prices is based purely on summer seasonal adjustment. In fact, gasoline has not risen nationwide. It's been hovering around $3.15 for quite some time. Meanwhile, new car prices fell 0.3%. Used car prices fell 0.7%.  Goods prices, which are really the most sensitive area to tariffs, have risen only 0.7 percent. That is only seven-tenths of one percent over the past three months when Mr. Trump's baseline tariff was put into place. Apparel prices over the past three months actually fell by eight-tenths of one percent. They too are rather tariff sensitive.  Now, to be sure, some prices rise while other prices fall each month. Did you know there are 80,000 prices in the Consumer Price Index grouped into 200 categories? So the New York Times will point out that home furnishing went up 1% in June.  And they are right. And recreational goods like TVs and sporting equipment increased a tenth of 1%. And that is also correct. But year to year, home furnishings are up only 1.7%. And the recreational goods actually fell a tenth of 1%. Again, in any given months, some prices rise, other prices fall.  I wouldn't be drawing any tariff conclusions about it just yet. You know, the peak of Bidenflation was nine percent and cumulatively over the course of his presidency, prices rose over 20 percent. Now, back in his first term, even with the Chinese tariffs.  Mr. Trump's inflation rate remained well under 2%. And here, in his second term, his inflation rate remains well under 2%. That means a 4.5% Federal Reserve target rate is way too high, as the president has been saying.  Real story here is Jay Powell's mismanagement of monetary policy and his bank's own gargantuan losses, not to speak of his Taj Mahal building cost overruns. Lefty media is trying to take the focus off Jay Powell and put it on Donald Trump. Guess what? Ain't going to work.

But anyway, the story about the Kite Runner,  When I say they're pretty funny, I mean that they sometimes laugh at my jokes. Oh Not always The the Kite Runner story is my wife Michelle Coffin is a very enthusiastic person and when she likes something she really likes it and she loved the book the Kite Runner and She would not I mean if you knew her you this would be  ring true. She will not, when she's enthusiastic about something, allow you not to be enthusiastic about that thing, even if you are a complete stranger trying to go about your life. So if there was a period of months, if not years, during which time, any time Michelle was with anybody and the subject of books came up, or even didn't necessarily come up, she would tell them they had to buy The Kite Runner. They had to read The Kite Runner.  I was in bookstores with her more than once when she would just go up to people, complete strangers, and say, have you read The Kite Runner? Or she'd be on a plane, and she'd see people who either were reading The Kite Runner, in which case she would encourage them to continue, or just pretty much tell people at random. So anyway, that book is hugely successful. So I think I have the figure in my book. It was only like 5 million copies, maybe more. But at least 3 million of those copies were sold personally by my wife, Michelle.  And I have asked her more than once, like, you know, could you maybe make one of my books into a gigantic bestseller? But so far, she's chosen not to do that for whatever reason. Have you done a memoir of any kind before this?  No, not a, no, not a proper memoir. I wrote a lot about my own life over the years when I was writing a column for many years. I mean, much of the time it was sort of like a diary of my life, but it was very much stylized. It was, you know, I was turning things into humor columns.

This is the only book I've ever written where I really tried to talk about my own life and be accurate.

My parents were both ardent Democrats.  I was, you know, in the 60s, I marched for civil rights and protested the war in Vietnam. I think the change for me came when I went to work for a newspaper, the Daily Local News in Westchester, Pennsylvania, when I started covering government, mostly local government, in  you know, the area where the daily local news covered, which was Chester County, Pennsylvania. And it just slowly began to seep into my consciousness that although a lot of people were very well-meaning and who were some very dedicated, selfless public servants, a lot of them weren't. And I kept noting that the people who were the most politically ambitious,  seem to be the least interested in actual and other people seem to be most interested in their own advancement.  and their own power and success. It just was sort of like an emotional vibe. And then I started to read more and more about it. Anyway, I don't want to get boring in the ideological weeds here, but I just gradually reached the conclusion that I was happier if I would be able to make most of the decisions about my own life for myself, that the fewer things that I had to cede the authority to,  people that I didn't know, but many of whom I'd met, really, I didn't think were smarter than me or better than me or nicer than me or more concerned about the future of the world than me, that rather than have them make decisions for me, I'd rather make them as much as possible myself. And that's pretty much my definition of libertarianism. I'm not an anarchist. I don't think there should be no government at all. I don't think people should be left to starve in the streets. I think we do have a responsibility to each other.  But I really, whenever there's a choice between something that is being done for me, or something that I can decide for myself, what would be the best way to do it, I prefer the latter. And in that sense, I'm a libertarian. There are things that, I'm sorry, just to continue, I disagree with both parties on a bunch of things. And I agree with both parties on a bunch of things.

I didn't.  hesitate to talk about it. I mean, I've never been ashamed of that. I've always thought that was the right decision. I still think that was the right decision. But it didn't. And, you know, over the years, as Vietnam drifted farther and farther into our, you know, national rearview mirror, it came up less and less. But I did feel like I should at least address it here since it was two years of my life right after I got out of college. And I was talking about how I became the humor columns that I ultimately became. I did feel I needed to just address that.  Let's go through some of the basics you get to. Where were you born? I was born in Armonk, New York, a little town about 30 miles or so west, I mean, north of New York City. When I grew up, it was a little village, 2,000 people. I literally knew everybody in that town. Very much small town vibe, even though we were close to New York City and a lot of the dads, my dad, for example, worked in New York City.  that Armonk is now part of the mega burbs and it is a very prestigious. I find it hilarious, really. It's like extremely expensive to live there and very Tony little town was not like that at all when I grew up. What was what did your dad do and what did your mom do back then? My dad was a Presbyterian minister, but he did not have a parish. He he was the executive director  an organization which still exists, I think, called the New York City Mission Society, which was an anti-poverty agency in New York. It ran programs for kids, ran summer camps for most of the kids from Harlem and the South Bronx. He was also very active in the civil rights movement at the time, and that's what he did. But he would, you know, every day go into New York City  to be the executive director of the New York City Mission Society. He also was active in churches around the city and even out to where I live, where he would, on some Sundays, he would preach at various places. But he was mostly, he didn't wear his collar backward or anything like that. He wasn't Mr. Go-Around preaching. And he was a very  relaxed about denominations. I mean, he did not, he didn't, we, his kids, there was no Presbyterian Church in Armonk, so we went to the Episcopal Church in Armonk, which, you know, the pastor there was a good friend of my dad's. He was not a big stickler for what specific, you know, religion you were, and he performed many, many weddings, in fact, back in the 50s and 60s, when like a  a Jewish kid and a Catholic kid had to get married, and neither the priest nor the rabbi would consent to that. My dad would marry them. He was, like, happy to do that. So that was my dad. My mom was a really interesting person. She was a child of the Depression, actually was born and raised in a house with a sod roof  In Nebraska, her dad was a mechanic at a sugar beet factory. They didn't have a lot of money. It was the Depression. She didn't have a happy childhood. She didn't get along particularly well with her mother. As soon as she could get away, she left. Left home, I think, when she was 16. She ended up going to the University of Nebraska, and then she went to Chicago and became a secretary. In fact, she was a secretary. She did not know this for the Manhattan Project. She took dictation from Enrico Fermi,  And we would ask her later, what did he say? She's like, I have no idea. I didn't understand anything. But that's where she met my dad. And they got married in New York. But anyway, my mom, she had a tough childhood. She she had depression. She battled with depression for her entire life. And she ultimately lost the battle. She ultimately took her own life. But she was, despite that, the funniest person I ever knew. She was very funny.  very edgy, very dark sense of humor. She would not take anything seriously. I mean, if there was a chance to see humor in it, she would. Um, so I, I've always said what people ask you, like when you do what I do, you're always getting asked, where do you get your sense of humor? I got it from my mom. I mean, both my dad and my mom were funny, but, and neither of them, they didn't take things too serious. They, they didn't, they're Midwesterners and did not believe in, in being pompous or anything like that.  But my mom had that real edge to her where she would just go for it, no matter what. And I got that from her. And ultimately, it was my career. It was just not taking things too seriously. Did you ever worry about getting depression yourself? No. I had a remarkably happy childhood. I mean, it's funny because my dad would... I talk about both of these things in the book. My dad became an alcoholic. He recovered and he spent the last...  10, 15, 20 years of his life helping other people with alcohol because he was a very good man. That's what he did. But he did have to go through that. And it was a rough, rough time for the whole family. And my mom was a depressive person who committed suicide. So, yeah, you get the short version is here's a kid raised by an alcoholic father and a mother who committed suicide. But that was not my childhood at all. They were both very funny. They were both loving. They did not inflict their problems on us kids. And so to answer your question,  I never worried about it. I guess now maybe you would. I was too young to worry about what depression was or whether you could inherit it or not, but I didn't. I was lucky and I had an excellent childhood. I'm not mentally ill unless you count what I do for a living, which is not really sane."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 966.766, "text": " As an interviewer, you're always looking for original questions to ask someone.

I'm in a rock band of authors with a lot of famous authors.  And one of them is Stephen King. And the day that the band formed in 1992, I don't think any of us knew each other. And I came into this room full of people playing instruments. And they were just god awful. We're still pretty bad. But it was, you know, a cacophony of badness. And Stephen King is one of them. He's strumming away on his guitar. And, you know, I pick up a guitar and start playing. And then, so I haven't met any of these people yet. I'm just starting in the room. We're just, hi, hi, I'm Dave. I'll play. And then when we took our first break,  Stephen King walked over to me. I've never met the guy. He's a big guy. He leans down to me, goes, so Dave Barry, where'd he get your ideas? And it's, you know, demonic cackle. What he was doing was making an author joke because authors get that question.  Over and over and over nobody's probably going to ask that question more than Stephen King has um, so that was our little thing little uh first in joke and that that's one of the reasons that The band we all became friends We were so used to being asked the same stuff and you know not having a good answer for it So we could bond over that How many years I think I remember 30, but you tell me how many years that you wrote that weekly column?  Well, it, uh, it, I mean, if you start at the very beginning, when I first started writing it for the daily local news in Westchester, Pennsylvania, it would have be about 1972. Um, but then for years and years, it was only in the daily local news in Westchester, Pennsylvania. And some of those years it wasn't there. It was like, cause I went, did other things for a while. Um, I started writing regularly, uh, in the mid seventies, like, um, or mid to late seventies.  And it started to really catch on in the early 80s. So from the early 80s, like 81, 82 to 2005 was when I formally stopped writing my weekly humor column. So I was about 20 whatever years of syndications, about 20 to 25 years, somewhere in there. But I mean, the beginning was just a few papers. At the end, it was like 500. Why'd you stop?  I stopped because I was just, I don't know, just, it felt like I've done this, I've done this, I've done this. Um, and you know, I don't have to keep doing it. Um, and I didn't have felt like this burning. I mean, I've never been an ideological calm. It's never, I don't have anything to say. I was just trying to entertain people. And I guess I felt a little tired of just trying to entertain people. I thought I was still good at it. Um, but I could sort of see a time coming when I thought maybe I wouldn't be, or I just be too burned out and doing it just to do it.  And I didn't want to. So I, and I had other options. I could write books. So I thought, well, I'll do that. What's weird is that, uh, after I finished this memoir, I started writing a sub stack, which is, um, I don't know what everybody knows what a sub stack is, but it's basically a blog, but you can write whatever you want. A lot of people now have sub stacks. A lot of people used to be in journalism and you can get paid to do it. You can get subscribers, but it's sort of just between you and the readers.  And I started doing it again, and I really have enjoyed it. I mean, it's been like, I don't know, four or five months now, and I'm having fun doing it. It feels different though, because I don't have any deadline. I can write or not write. I don't have any length requirement. I can add graphical elements, whatever I want. And I don't have any editor telling me, you know, so.

It was based on William Sapphire's column. I don't know, William Sapphire for many years.  wrote a column for the New York Times called On Language, and he was a real stickler for proper grammar. It was brilliant, I thought, this column. And he's also a political columnist, but it was his language column that I loved.  the right way to do it. And so I decided to start Mr. Language Person, who did everything wrong. It was never correct. It was the worst writing advice in the history of writing. And readers loved it. And part of the reason readers loved it, it was that some of them didn't get it. I mean, some people would read it and they would, this would be a column completely full of stupid statements about writing.  you know, dozens and dozens of incorrect statements and people would tear it out, write it in circle one of these things and say, you know, you should check, you should do some research before you call yourself a language expert because this is incorrect. Meanwhile, they like this whole forest of other incorrect statements surrounding it.  So that anyway, I love Mr. Language Person. That was a lot of fun. I in fact plan to do some more Mr. Language Persons now that I have a substack. Maybe one of the things that people ask him, Mr. Language Person is what the hell a substack is. But just one other thing, one of the things I loved about William Sapphire is after I started writing the Mr. Language Person column,  I would get in touch with him to ask him questions and he would always answer me. Like, you know, at one point the big, the burning issue was, does the Lone Ranger say, hi ho silver away or hi yo silver away? I'll never forget I called.  I called William Sapphire, I had his number, and he would take my calls. And he would pick up the phone, you know, and say, hi, this is Dave Barry. Does the Lone Ranger say hi-ho silver or hi-yo silver? Without hesitation, he would go, hi-yo silver. He was the authority.

And we became friends, oh God,  probably 20, 30 years ago, he wrote me a fan letter, which was extremely flattering, because obviously I've always been a fan of his, but I did not know he was aware of me. And we corresponded, and then in 2003, well actually 2002, he sent me an email, very funny email, with a word that I probably can't say even on C-SPAN, that asked, he's saying, I'm going to be hosting the Oscars next year, 2003, and do you want to be part of the  the, you know, do you want to be on the team of writers? No, F you, is what he said. You know, anyway, it's a funny letter. I did not do it justice just now. And email, excuse me, not letter. And so I, you know, I said, sure, I'd be on his team of writers, mainly because my wife, Michelle, was  And I had read the email and saw that she would get a ticket to go to the Oscars if I said yes. And so, like, we were going to go to the Oscars. I was going to be on the writer team. If only, I mean, that very night she bought shoes. This is like months before the Oscars are going to happen. She went and bought a fairly expensive and extremely uncomfortable pair of shoes. So we were committed to write for the Oscars. So I go out to L.A. I'm a nervous wreck because  I have never done this. I've never written for anybody, let alone Steve Martin for the Oscars. And I know I'm going to be in this team of people who are, you know, the cream of the crop of the really good comedy writers in LA do this gig.  They, you know, we were going to be in a hotel room with Steve Martin and we're going to try to come up with jokes. And the process I assumed would be that you would sit in around this room around and, uh, Steve Martin would be there and you would pitch jokes. And in my mind, the jokes would come out as like really hilarious, wonderful showbiz quips suitable for being on this broadcast to millions of people. And that's how you would write it. Um, and.  And so I'm a nervous wreck because I don't have any jokes. Like that's not how I work. I sit in a room alone, staring at a screen, gradually forming a, you know, a thought into some words and slowly forming those words into a, you know, a joke and crafting it. And I, you know, with nobody watching me and, you know, failing over and over again, that's my process. So the idea of sitting in a room full of really smart, really funny people with Steve Martin,  And having to come up with jokes, it was very, very intimidating to me. And so I, I get to this hotel, which is somewhere right around where I am right now in Beverly Hills. And, um.  we get in this room and they are in fact very, very funny people. These are really, really sharp, funny people. Um, and there's Steve Martin, I've corresponded with, but I've never met him. So I'm very intimidated. I'm like sitting next to Steve Martin. And then this, the process begins and it, and I'm like frozen cause I have no jokes, you know, and there's banter going on and they've all worked together and yeah.  But gradually, I became aware of the process, which is not what I envisioned. It's not like you just spew out.  you know, ready, perfectly crafted jokes. It's, it's more like somebody will say, what about this? And then somebody else will say, yeah, and then somebody else, and, and, you know, some of the ideas sound funny, but aren't really there yet. And some don't sound funny at all, but nobody goes, that sucks. You're, you're stupid. Get out of here. It's like, okay, well we could, let's, and they gradually build it together. They work together and nobody, nobody's judgmental. Everybody's supportive and they kind of,  form it into a joke. And then Steve Martin gets up and says something, you know, and then you could think of another way of doing it. So it was very collaborative and very, very supportive. Now there are jerks and there are people in that business who don't do it that way, who want all the credit and everything. But in this particular room, it wasn't about getting the credit. It was like, how can we make this funnier? How can we make this work? And once I got that, that I wasn't going to be judged if my idea wasn't perfect.  then I could participate, got to know them a little bit. And I really enjoyed it. And it was wonderful to watch it all come together. And then finally, the night of the show, and Steve delivers this monologue, and it's really good. And at that point, I could sort of remember, OK, I helped contribute that or that. But it wasn't like, that was my joke. So I ended up liking it a lot. I did it one other time when he hosted in 2010 with Alec Baldwin.  but that's the only other time I've done it. And I don't, I mean, it's still not what I do. I'm still like, I'm happier writing my own stuff with my name attached to it and having total control over what every word, as opposed to having maybe an input into a joke that somebody else is going to deliver.

What year was that?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 37, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 2078.244, "text": "Oh, okay. Well, there was a hiatus, not a hiatus, but there was a break between those two. I went to work for the Daily Local News in Westchester, Pennsylvania in 1971. I was hired as a general assignment reporter, covered  police and fire and wrote obituaries and all these horribly dull municipal meetings that made up a huge chunk of our coverage. I'm sure nobody read this story. So I worked there. I became an editor there. I really got into journalism there. Everything I know about journalism, I learned from doing that job, which was, it was a wonderful, it was fun. But it was a little paper in Pennsylvania.  And I thought, well, I gotta, you know, I have to move up. I have to be ambitious here. So I took a job at the Associated Press in, I think, 1975, five or six around there. Associated Press in Philadelphia, which is a much bigger name, obviously, than the Daily Local News in Westchester, Pennsylvania. But I hated it. I hated the Associated Press. It was much more regimented, much more limiting what I was allowed to do. I couldn't  Couldn't write any humor at all. I mean, I was writing AP style, which is very dry. Didn't like it. And so, well, I should have mentioned, while I was at the Daily Local News, I was writing a humor column. It wasn't why I was paid to be there, but I would write every week a little column. I stopped doing that when I went to the Associated Press. Hated the Associated Press.  After a year there, I had an opportunity to leave and a friend of mine, his father ran a company called Burger Associates, which taught effective writing seminars to business people. Go into a plant, you know, like a DuPont plant somewhere and  a bunch of chemical engineers and talk to them about writing better memos and reports, that kind of thing. I knew nothing about that, but I hated the AP, and so I took that job. And so for the next seven years, from the mid-70s until the early 80s, that's what I did. I traveled around the country,  teaching effective writing seminars to accountants, to engineers, to computer programmers, people who had to write a lot, but weren't really writers. And I would teach this little seminar and, you know, how to organize, how to get to the point, how to cut your word, you know, not be too wordy, that kind of thing. But that left me a lot of time, spare time. I was on the road and I was in hotels and airports.  So I started writing my humor column again for the Daily Local News back in Westchester, Pennsylvania, and they ran it. They ran it every week, and they paid me, I believe, $22 a week to write this weekly humor column. And by the late 70s, I was trying to see if I could expand that a little bit. That was not my job. I was still making a living teaching effective writing, but I would send my column. It would clip it out of the Daily Local News Xerox and send it to other newspapers.  And occasionally they would run them, you know, they'd pay me 10 or 15 bucks and run my column. And then in the early eighties, I started getting freelance assignments from bigger papers, the main one being the Philadelphia Inquirer in Philly. And that was a pretty prestigious paper at the time. And I wrote some stuff for them. And then I wrote finally one that was a real big breakthrough one. In 1981, I wrote about natural childbirth when my son Rob was born.  And it was a longer humor essay and it just went viral to the extent something could go viral in those days. Because I was a baby boomer having a kid and all the editors of these newspapers had become boomers for having kids. And so that essay was reprinted all over the place. And suddenly I had a chance to maybe  leave this world of business, effective writing, and become full-time a humor writer. I'm in my 30s now, mid-30s, really. And that's what happened. And the Miami Herald, they saw that one about natural childbirth and the birth of my son and ran that. And the editor there, Gene Weingarten, from that point on just wanted me, he wanted to hire me. And in 1983, the Herald hired me as a full-time humor writer.  And that was it. I never had a real job ever again. I had the best job in the world. I was writing humor, really writing whatever I wanted and getting paid for it. Why'd you turn down Ben Bradley at the Washington Post? That was later. After a few years at the Herald, my column was really catching on. And I was, yeah, I was wooed. And if you had told the 1970s me  um, who was the Daily Local News when Watergate broke and, you know, I was mesmerized by Woodward and Bernstein and had read All the President's Men and saw the movie and everything. If you had told that me that there was going to come a time, maybe 10 years or so later, where Ben Bradley was going to woo me, was going to take me to lunch, was going to try to hire me to write humor for him, I would have said, well, of course I will do that.  But when it actually happened, I didn't do it. I was really happy at the Miami Herald. I was a, they let me do anything. And I mean, I had a degree of, and they kind of, my editor down there, Gene Weingarten, was an insane person. And I mean that in a good way. He would, he really would push for me to do stuff that was, you know, not normal journalism stuff, you know, real reader involvement stuff.  of performance humor stuff. And the Washington Post, wonderful newspaper, Ben Bradley, wonderful, brilliant editor, great guy, very charming man, was offering me a job in Washington, D.C., where it was not a wild and crazy place. You know, journalism in Washington, it's all about politics. It's very serious. If they do like humor, Art Buchwald, if it's political humor, but not wacky, crazy, bizarre humor. And I wanted to be able to keep  doing that. So as flattered as I was, and I was extremely flattered, and as insane as all my friends thought I was to turn down the Washington Post, I chose to stay at the Miami Herald and continue being a little bit closer to the crazy part of journalism. I never regretted that decision. I mean, I'm still in Miami and I still love it there. And I never regretted any of my time at the Miami Herald, which was, you know, they gave me all the freedom anybody could ask for."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2486.275, "text": " Please excuse us for interrupting.

I would go to Iowa for the caucuses, New Hampshire for the primaries, and I would go to both political conventions.  that they were just, I don't know how anybody writes seriously about American politics. You know, like when you get on the campaign trail and just see, you know, how kind of like just stupid so much of our campaign, you know, like all these ridiculously staged events where people do ridiculously staged things. What does this have to do with being president of the United States? And then the conventions,  are, are just this, you know, well, they, they no longer are the big deal they were, which is because they just nothing ever happened to Adam. I mean, they were, you know, this big, incredibly elaborate, but really basically on, you know, pointless exercises, where, you know, a preordained thing happens, which is the person that we all know is going to be the candidate is nominated  And whoever he picks is his vice president. And then a whole lot of really gas baggy speeches get made. It's just not, you know, it's not real news. And yet so many journalists would show up for these things. Not so much now, but, but in the, in the eighties. Yeah. I mean, it was like still a big deal. Every newspaper sent dozens, everybody went. So the thing you're referring to is Atlanta, I believe 1988.  And Michael Dukakis was going to be nominated by the Democrats. Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Benson were the ticket. And so we're in Atlanta and it's, you know, everybody already knows Michael Dukakis is going to be nominated and Lloyd Benson is going to be his vice president. So there's nothing news, no news. Thousands and thousands of journalists are on hand to cover this non-event.  Um, and of course it's all, it's a lot of Kabuki theater outside. There are protests, they're always protests and just, you know, they schedule them and they're just so pointless. Nothing happens. Nobody's really paying attention. It's just, you know, it's all just for show. Anyway, it just seems so dumb. And, um, so I'm there one day and I'm walking around outside in the, uh, the, in the designated protest area of the democratic convention.  this, you know, there's a million photographers and reporters and, you know, covering the protests. And a woman comes walking by holding a rat. It's like a pet, you know, pet rat, little rat. And somebody starts, you know, some photographer, TV guy zooms in on her. So, you know, the other ones see that and they all scurry over and everybody suddenly there's all these news people are surrounding a woman with a rat.  And I remember that night I'm watching TV in my Atlanta hotel and there's the rat on television. It was like pretty early in the broadcast, the rat, you know, cause what else was happening? And I thought, this is so ridiculous that we are, we're here. So many of us here and that we have to cover whatever happens. So we're covering a rat. So I decided to do a little, and this is getting back to the kind of performance humor that I was talking about earlier.  I enlisted the aid of two of my fellow columnists, Bob Morris of the Orlando Sentinel and Eric Lacedis of the Seattle Times. And we got boxes. Mine was like a telephone box. And we cut holes for our eyes in the front of these boxes. We went to the designated protest area and stood in a circle with our backs to each other and put our boxes over our heads. We didn't have our press credentials on, so it was just three men,  standing there with boxes over their heads. And you think the rat got a lot of attention. We were immediately, I mean, immediately surrounded by TV crews, radio crews, print reporters, print photographers.  where I later saw a photograph taken from a building showing there we are, the three of us, and then there's this mob of journalists around us, people with boxes over their heads. And they're asking this stuff like, well, who are you? And we're like, well, we're people with boxes over our heads. And they go, what are you doing? Well, we're standing here with boxes on. So anyway, the next day, we were the lead  pro lead item in the protest roundup from the democratic convention the people with boxes over their heads and then pictures of us and a whole bunch of newspapers ran pictures of the box people with boxes on their heads protest  So we all write columns about this naturally, because we're columnists. And basically the point of the columns was, isn't this stupid? You know, we'd have nothing, you know, we have nothing to do, but, but, you know, cover guys with the boxes on their heads. And I got this angry reaction from other journalists. I got all these calls the next day in the Knight Ritter Bureau, like,  Why, what would you, why were you hoaxing the media? You hoaxed the media. And we're like, no, we didn't. We didn't hoax anybody. We had boxes on our heads and we told you we had boxes on our heads. You're the ones who put it in the newspaper.

I got so much mail from hate mail, hate mail, I mean seething hate mail from the Neil Diamond people that I ended up writing another column about the hate mail, which triggered a whole lot of people who agreed with me and you know,  So I ended up, it went on for weeks, the Neil Diamond issue in my column, and ultimately I ended up writing a book about songs that people hate. But I think some of them are still angry at me. What about Neil Diamond? You know what? I don't think he ever, I don't think he took it that personally. I do know that not long after that column ran, I was watching the Today Show with Katie Couric. This is way back when Katie was there, and she was interviewing Neil Diamond.

Senate Republicans make changes to the House passed rescissions bill to gain necessary Republican support ahead of the first procedural vote, restoring $400 million for PEPFAR, the global anti-AIDS program, and protecting funding for some rural public broadcasters. Inflation report from the Labor Department.  up 0.3 percent in June. Annual rate is 2.7 percent, highest since February. Maybe a sign President Donald Trump's tariffs are leading to increases in prices. House Republicans vote down a Democratic motion to make public the FBI files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.  After the Trump administration stated Epstein did not keep a client list and did commit suicide in prison, which some of the president's MAGA supporters are questioning, President Trump today telling reporters that Attorney General Pam Bondi should release whatever she thinks is credible about Jeffrey Epstein.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations nominee Mike Walls testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about reforming the U.N. And also the Signal Chat controversy when he was National Security Advisor and a reporter was mistakenly added to an unencrypted app chat on a military operation against the Houthis in Yemen. Plus, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte meets with senators on Capitol Hill about supporting Ukraine in the war with Russia.  Politico writes that Senate Republicans will scale back the White House's $9.4 billion spending clawback request as they look to shore up their vote count. Senator Eric Schmidt, Republican of Missouri, who was leading the rescissions effort in concert with the White House, said Republicans will move a $400 million cut to the global AIDS program known as PEPFAR, bringing the total amount of cuts in the package down to $9 billion.  Separately, the administration won over Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, by promising to alleviate funding cuts to public radio and TV by funding tribal broadcasters through a separate program. That was some of the reporting from Politico. The Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, spoke about this to reporters today.  This week, as you know, is the rescissions bill, is the legislation that's going to be on the floor, at least we hope it's going to be on the floor later today. We're going to have a couple of procedural votes and we'll see how those come out. But one thing I can tell you in the Trump administration is that there has been a renewed commitment to reducing spending.  It's actually become in favor to try and find ways to get rid of waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. And I think that was part of his mandate coming out of this election. It's something that he and his administration are committed to do. We have partnered with him on the one big beautiful bill with the biggest spending reduction in history on the mandatory side of the equation. The rescissions bill this week deals with discretionary spending, the other part of the federal budget.  And I'm hopeful that we'll have the opportunity to get on that bill and to do something meaningful when it comes to reducing the size and scope of the federal government, and particularly in areas of our government where we know there is waste, fraud and abuse. Now, the Democrats have suggested that they would shut the government down  over us taking up rescission, that somehow that's going to step on the normal appropriations process. And I guess what I would point out is that rescissions have been a part of the process around here for a long time, not only in the annual appropriations process, but both administrations have in the past submitted rescissions packages to the Congress. And I'd also remind people that what we're talking about here is one-tenth of one percent of all federal spending.  one-tenth of one percent of all federal spending. That's one thousandth of the federal budget that's included in this rescission package. And so I hope we have the votes to get on this bill later today and to have an opportunity for people to offer amendments if they see things that they want to, they think they can fix or  modify in the legislation, that's always an opportunity that people have when the bill comes to the floor. But clearly this is something that all of us believe is a priority. When you've got a $36 trillion debt, we have to do something to get spending under control. Couple that with policies like we had in the one big beautiful bill that create growth in the economy, expand the economy, create those better paying jobs and generate more government revenue. Couple that with spending restraint, both on the mandatory side and the discretionary side.  and we can start to get this thing back into balance, which is where it needs to be if we're going to do anything meaningful to ensure that we have a better and brighter future for future generations of Americans. So that's the subject for today, and obviously we'll have an opportunity to see where the votes are tonight. Questions?  By changing the scope of this and putting the AIDS money back in, was that necessary to get votes to get this to pass the Senate? And what consternation does that cause across the building and the House by changing this and reducing the size of the overall package? There was a lot of interest among our members in doing something on the PEPFAR issue.  And so that's reflected in the substitute. And we hope that if we can get this across the finish line in the Senate, that the House would accept that one small modification that ends up making the package still about a $9 billion rescissions package, a little less than what was sent over from the House, but nonetheless a significant down payment on getting rid of waste, fraud, and abuse in our government."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 333.425, "text": "Was that pre-Banker Johnson?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 335.303, "text": " Well, I wouldn't say anything is pre-baked, but obviously it's something we've been working closely with the administration on. And my assumption is that the level of coordination that we've had between the House and the Senate, that they would take up. You're still talking about a $9 billion rescissions package, even with that small modification. Senator Brown said that he secured a grant proposal for a local public radio in Oklahoma State, too. How exactly is that going to work? Do you have to reframe?  Well, it's actually a solution that he developed in working with the White House, with OMB, that allows them to reprogram some funding that would address the 28 stations around the country that receive funding through CPB that are on our Native American reservations. So it was an individual thing that he worked out.  Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican from South Dakota, meeting with reporters. ABC News writes that the Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vogt met with Senate Republicans as some members remain resistant to pulling back all of the funding. Vogt left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate the cuts to an AIDS prevention program. That's PEPFAR. He said there is a substitute amendment that does not include the PEPFAR rescission and we're fine with that.  That was from ABC News. The Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, was asked by reporters at his news conference whether the changes to the rescission bill from the Republicans would change the Democratic caucus' unanimous opposition.  Look, the Republican bill keeps changing. We still know it does lots of horrible things. The rural areas that don't have their radio stations, that in many cases is the only way or the best way they can get weather warnings, is terrible. They've changed and added a small amount on the foreign aid proposal, but it still leaves an enormous vacuum that China and Russia will fill. We're going to try to improve the bill in any way we can.  Look, we are doing everything. First of all, ask the Republicans that question. We are doing everything we can, everything we can, to keep the bipartisan appropriations process going forward. It's what's  Every president has done, democrat, republican, liberal, conservative, and it serves the country well because people are represented and don't get hurt. When one side tries to do it all, it creates big problems. We are pushing hard to get the appropriations process moving, continuing to move forward, and that's why we're cooperating with the bills they're putting on the floor.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat from New York, at a news conference on Capitol Hill. The first procedural vote this evening in the Senate on the rescissions package will be a motion to discharge the bill from the Appropriations Committee. Simple majority needed. And Republicans hold a 53 to 47 vote advantage in the Senate.  If and when the rescissions bill passes the Senate, it's likely to look different than when it passed the House. So it would need to go back to the House for another vote. So the same version passes both bodies and go to the president to be signed. Friday is the deadline under the rescissions procedures. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, asked about that at a news conference today.  Mr. Speaker, what's the consternation among House Republicans about possible changes to the decisions bill in the Senate and what that would be like in terms of timing as you're up against this deadline on Friday?  Yeah, the Friday deadline looms. We're encouraging our Senate partners over there to get the job done and to pass it as is. That's what we did. It reflects the intention and the view of the House. This, in our view, is low-hanging fruit. This rescission package is, you know, you're talking about funding for USAID, the egregious abuses that the DOJ  analysis and audits uncovered. We've got to claw that back. The American people, everybody demands that. We can't fund transgender operas in Peru with U.S. taxpayer dollars, right? So, come on. The NPR and PBS components are, these are, you know, this is, in our view, the misuse of taxpayer dollars. They're biased reporting. They're not objective. They pretend to be so. They have for a long time.  And the people don't need to fund that. I mean, we're in an age of, you all know, you work in the industry. I mean, media is so multifaceted now. There's so many avenues and areas for information. And while at its origination, NPR and PBS might have made some sense, and maybe it does now, but it shouldn't be subsidized by taxpayers. So these are simple questions to answer for us. The House has acted inappropriately, and I hope the Senate will do the same.

Now Trump and McMahon are free to execute the layoffs and break up the department's work among other federal agencies.

The Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke this morning on the Senate floor.  Americans woke up this morning to a troubling headline. U.S. inflation accelerated in June as Trump's tariffs pushed up prices. That's what the New York Times said this morning. We've said from the start that Donald Trump's tariffs are a national sales tax on working and middle class families.  And now these tariffs are causing inflation to rise, as many of us feared. And there is too large a chance that this tariff increase is just the beginning as increased chaos on tariffs rise. Tariffs raise the price of groceries, add thousands of dollars in additional costs to the average household. And Trump's chaotic approach does nothing, nothing,  to make our economy stronger. Even worse, real wages are down for June as Americans pay more for groceries, electricity, health care costs. And that is before the big ugly betrayal, which will steal people's Medicaid, kill jobs, and jack up people's electricity bills.  Remember what Donald Trump said on the campaign trail? He said that if elected, he would bring costs down on day one. It is now the middle of July. Inflation is going up. And that is the definition of a broken promise.

From the Hill, the latest attempt by House Democrats to force a vote on releasing files related to the disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein failed on Tuesday. Democrats unsuccessfully urged the chamber to oppose a routine procedural vote, known as the motion on ordering the previous question, since failure would have triggered a vote on Congressman Ro Khanna, Democratic California's amendment  requiring Attorney General Pam Bondi to preserve, compile, and publish the Epstein files. The Epstein files have been a source of controversy in Washington, especially the Republican Party in recent days, with the MAGA base demanding its disclosure, while President Trump directs those in his party to drop the matter. That was from The Hill. Here's Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon, Democrat of Pennsylvania, member of the Rules Committee, on the House floor.  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to make in order Amendment No. 50 to H.R. 3633, offered by Representative Conniff, which requires the Attorney General to preserve and release any records related to Jeffrey Epstein.  I applaud my colleagues, Representatives Veazey and Khanna, for their work to release the Epstein files. I strongly support these efforts and the release of the files. Last night at the Rules Committee, Republicans rejected an amendment that would have required the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files, multiple criminal investigations which allegedly documented trafficking of young women and girls by Jeffrey Epstein, a sex offender and financier with whom the President often socialized.  For years, the President and those in his orbit, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, alleged that prior administrations had covered up the identities of the rich and powerful people to whom Epstein had trafficked the girls and the facts surrounding his allegedly suspicious death. They came into office pledging to seek accountability for the horrific crimes by revealing Epstein's client list  and other information, but recently backtracked and refused to release any further information. There appear to be only two explanations for this about face.

Half of Americans say they are dissatisfied with the amount of information the federal government has released about the Jeffrey Epstein case, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS in the days after the Justice Department released a memo saying there is no evidence the convicted sex offender kept a so-called client list or was murdered.  Almost no one is content with the amount the government has shared. Just 3% of Americans say they're satisfied with it. A sizable chunk of the public either says it doesn't matter to them either way, 29%, or that they haven't heard enough about the case to say, 17%.  President Trump's most ardent supporters online have been in revolt since the Justice Department's memo release, even as the president has implored them to move on from Epstein and publicly back Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Mike Waltz, writes Associated Press, told lawmakers Tuesday at his confirmation hearing to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations that he plans to make the world body great again, echoing President Donald Trump's message for revamping America. Appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Waltz is facing lawmakers for the first time  since he was ousted as national security advisor for mistakenly adding a journalist to a private signal chat used to discuss sensitive military plans. Reporting from Associated Press, here is part of Mike Walsh's opening statement before the committee. We should have one place in the world where everyone can talk, where China, Russia, Europe, the developing world can come together and resolve conflicts. But after 80 years, it's drifted from its core mission of peacemaking. We must return to the UN's charter.  and first principles.  Peacekeeping certainly has an important role, but also needs reform. The U.S. funds 25 percent of these efforts, yet we have missions in Africa. I've talked to a number of you about this during our visits. They cost billions, tens of thousands of soldiers. We've had two that have been around since the 1940s, with no mandate renewal and no end in sight. We must press the Security Council on length, cost, clear end states, and focusing on peacekeeping, not nation-building.  Mike Walsh nominated for U.S. ambassador to the U.N., testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. More from the Associated Press article on his appearance. The U.N. post is the last one to be filled in President Trump's cabinet following months of delay, including the withdrawal of the previous nominee. Walsh, a former Florida congressman, was introduced by Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Rick Scott of Florida as a seasoned policy mind and skilled negotiator.  And that was from the Associated Press article. Here's more of the hearing. The committee's ranking Democrat, Gene Shaheen of New Hampshire, asking Mike Walz about the U.S. and China and influence at the U.N.  Mr. Walz, these last few months have illustrated how China is all too eager to take advantage of our disengagement at the UN and around the world. And while we may not all like what some UN institutions do, if we aren't at the table, we can't influence the agenda.  So do you agree that if confirmed, a central responsibility of your role at the UN will be to ensure that the United States is present, able, and willing to counter the PRC's growing influence at the UN?  Thank you, Senator Shaheen. I appreciate the question. I agree. It's absolutely critical. And if confirmed, yes, I agree. I will take just a second to point out, under the first Trump administration, under the 2018 National Security Strategy, he really led the pivot, which I think pivoted  the entire national security apparatus in Washington, D.C., away from the Middle East, away from counterterrorism, not as a zero-sum, but to focus on the near-peer threat that China absolutely is. And then just in this administration, Secretary Rubio's first trip was down to Panama to address what we've all heard.  Hearing after hearing, an encroachment on the Panama Canal, a strategic waterway. Panama is now the first Latin American country in decades to back away from the Belt and Road Initiative. The malicious behavior, but also the potential of the Chinese Communist Party, the malicious behavior, the potential of the relationship, I should say, will be top of mind for me. I know it is for the Secretary and the President.  You know, I agree with you, Congressman. That's why I find it so puzzling that there's been no coherent strategy for how to address China within this administration. There's no consistent messaging. If you look at where China is moving in, where the United States has moved out, within days of our shutting down of USAID and foreign assistance programs, China was already labeling the United States as an unreliable partner.  Within months, China has moved in to so many of those foreign assistance programs that have been shut down, that had been operating for years to provide a role for the United States and so much of the world.  We have packed up our bags and gone home, and China's there. They're on the ground. And if you read the report, you will see instance after instance that questions why what we're doing makes us stronger against China and allows us to compete. So let me  Let me ask another question about the UN, because this administration has outlined a host of cuts to UN and its sub-agencies. It makes no secret of its disdain for multilateral institutions. But I haven't seen a plan from the administration on how it intends to push back against the PRC's influence. So can you describe how you think we should be doing that?  Thank you, Senator Shaheen. Just a few points to address there. Number one, I look forward to reading the report and to working with you, the committee, and the team on that. I have to tell you, though, in my experience, even in the last six months, but even more broadly, I've seen partners in the Middle East that were heading into the PRC's orbit  make it very clear that they want to work with the United States, particularly since the election of President Trump. Mike Walsh nominated for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Those questions from Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, the ranking member.  Another paragraph from the Associated Press article on Mike Walsh's testimony. That was from AP. This is when Mike Walsh was national security advisor. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, asking him about it.  I want to get to the larger questions of the UN and the UN mission, but in your role in the Army, in the House, as National Security Advisor, you have long handled classified and highly sensitive information. We both know signal is not an appropriate, secure means of communicating highly sensitive information.  On March 24th, the Atlantic Magazine published a series of signal messages, including sensitive information about a U.S. military operation against the Houthis in Yemen involving you and several other Trump officials. Were you investigated for this disclosure of sensitive operational information on signals?  Thank you, Senator. And that engagement was driven by and recommended by the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency, by the Biden administration, the CISA guidance.  I'm sorry. And I have here. Well, just the use of security information on signal that use it. No, excuse me. The use of signal, uh, is not only, uh, as an encrypted app is not only authorized, it was recommended, uh, in Biden's, uh, the Biden era system guidance. Uh, and, and in fact, if you, it says here, I'll read it to you.  Use only end-to-end encrypted communications. Adopt a free messaging application to secure communications that guarantees end-to-end encryption, particularly if you are a highly targeted individual, such as Signal or similar apps. CISA recommends end-to-end encryption messaging on both government and personal devices.  Sensitive military operational information. Oh, of course. Of course, Senator. There was no classified information exchange. For sensitive military operate. This, you were sharing details about an upcoming airstrike and the time of launch and the potential targets. I mean, this was demonstrably sensitive information. And the question I asked was, were you investigated for this expansion of the signal group to include a journalist?  The White House conducted an investigation, and my understanding is the Department of Defense is still conducting an investigation. Was any disciplinary action taken? From the White House Investigation Center? Yes. No, the use of signal was not only authorized, it's still authorized and highly recommended.  Would you recommend the use of Signal for classified information to be shared between folks who have access to classified information? Again, we followed the recommendation, almost the demand, to use end-to-end encryption, but there was no classified information shared. Did you speak to Secretary Hegseth about his decision to share detailed information on the specifics of an imminent military strike?  What we spoke about, Senator, was a highly successful mission that did something that something that the Biden administration did not do was actually target the Houthi leadership. We subsequently saw a ceasefire, an increase in shipping and a drop in attacks on our ships. Well, look, here's what I hear on this exchange, and I want to get to the U.N. point.  At the time, you took responsibility for having added a journalist inadvertently to a signal chat. But it doesn't seem to me that the administration's taken any action to make sure this doesn't happen again. There's been no consequences. And yet the president continues to denounce those who leak information. We both know signal is not a secure way to convey classified information. And I was hoping to hear from you that you had some sense of regret over  sharing what was very sensitive, timely information about a military strike on a commercially available app that's not, as we both know, the appropriate way to share such critical information. Again, Senator, I think where we have a fundamental disagreement is there was no classified information on that chat.  Mike Walsh, former member of Congress, former National Security Advisor at the White House, now nominated for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, getting questions from Senator Chris Coons, Democrat from Delaware. There were two other ambassadorial nominees at this hearing, John Arrigo for the Ambassador to Portugal, and Christine Turetti to Sweden. But as NBC News notes, the vast majority of the questions were directed to Walsh.  You can find the full video of this hearing at our website at cspan.org. Military Times writes, the Senate on Tuesday confirmed retired Army Brigadier General Anthony Tata as the next Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, putting the controversial nominee in charge of a host of department programs  supporting troops and their families. Tata was approved for the post by a partisan 52 to 46 vote, with all Republicans present in the chamber backing his nomination and all Democrats opposing it. Tata served as a senior advisor to the Defense Secretary during President Donald Trump's first term in office, a position he was appointed to after a failed attempt to gain confirmation as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy. His bid was derailed by the revelation of numerous inflammatory comments on social media  and in past media appearances, including labeling of former President Barack Obama as a terrorist leader and a secret Muslim believer. That reporting from Military Times. From Fox News, Russian President Vladimir Putin has yet to publicly respond to the 50-day ultimatum President Donald Trump issued him, though one top official on Tuesday suggested that Moscow didn't care.

Here he was asked if he agreed with his daughter-in-law, who says there should be transparency in the Epstein case.

With me now, Jesse Weber, News Nation legal contributor. Hello, sir.  Good to see you, thanks for having me. You too, thanks for being here. So here's what I hope you can square for me. Because I heard the president today there on the South Lawn, and he said, as it relates to Pam Bondi, he said, quote, it's going to be up to her. What she thinks is credible, she should release. So I hear that from the president this afternoon. Here was Alan Dershowitz last night talking to Chris Cuomo, and then I want to connect the two.  Many of the things that are being suppressed are being suppressed by two judges in Manhattan. The judges have issued orders, which is why I can't disclose things I'd love to disclose, saying that you can't disclose this information. But Pam Bondi and the Justice Department and Donald Trump are not responsible for that. I don't know of any information that they could disclose that they haven't disclosed. All right, so square all of that for me, Weber.  I think he's basically saying the right thing here. Right. So a lot of this has already been released. Trump or Dershowitz? I think Dershowitz is right. I think a lot of this has already been released during the course of litigation and during the course of the criminal case of Ghislaine Maxwell. What's being protected right now are the identities of these alleged victims and any material that might jeopardize them or embarrass them in any sort of way. So when you look at Pam Bondi not releasing information, of course, there's one side to say she's got a lot  more that she could release. She said she had the list on her desk. There's a cover up or what really it could have been. Everything that we heard up until last week was an over exaggeration and a misunderstanding of what this case was about, that there was no client list, that there was no piece of paper with everything. There was a misunderstanding about what really was at stake. And remember, Glenn Maxwell, the case wasn't about that. She was being processed, that she was sex trafficking people to all these different people. It was just to Jeffrey Epstein. So I'm curious. I think your source is right here.  So Ghislaine Maxwell, there was a question that was posed to the House Speaker Mike Johnson today because there was a story yesterday or earlier this week in the Daily Mail about the possibility of her testifying before Congress. Mike Johnson was asked about that. Here's part of his response.  I'm for transparency. We should put everything out there and let the people decide it. Pam Bondi, I don't know, when she originally made the statement, I think she was talking about documents as I understood it. They were on her desk. I don't know that she was specific about a list or whatever, but she needs to come forward and explain that to everybody. I like Pam. I mean, I think she's done a good job. We need the DOJ focusing on the major priorities. So let's get this thing resolved. Mike Johnson on the Benny show there earlier today. Are we going to see Maxwell testify before Congress at some point?  Probably unlikely she could. And by the way, she's already been convicted. So the idea of the Fifth Amendment, right. But what value would she have? Would she be a credible witness? And by the way, if she was willing to name names, why didn't she do that before she was prosecuted in 2021 to work out a favorable deal?  So the question is, if she comes on the stand and she testifies in front of Congress, what exactly is the information that she would provide? How would you be able to verify it? And would it actually help her criminal appeal? She's making a lot of arguments that she shouldn't be prosecuted because of the non-prosecution agreement of Jeffrey Epstein. That's a credible argument. I haven't heard anything to suggest she has more information that could buy her some sort of favorable treatment. So I'm not sure she would actually want to do it or it actually would happen.  I have no doubt we will be talking to you soon. Jeffrey, Jesse Weber, NewsNation legal contributor with us tonight. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. Of course. All right. So the president today also having to defend his record on another issue, the economy. Really, if you think about it here, this was the first time today since the president announced those quote unquote liberation day tariffs back in April, where he had to defend rising prices.  That's because this, inflation up 0.3% from May to June, and according to the Consumer Price Index report today, year over year, prices are 2.7% higher. You can see, obviously, they've come down, but a tick up there. It's now increased for two straight months, June and May.  the two months that follow the April announcement. Prices went up on things like food and shelter, while gasoline and apparel prices were down. The President's citing an increase in tariff revenue in his defense of the economy. Since January, $87 billion has been brought in, compared to basically $35 billion the same time last year, the bulk of it coming after Liberation Day. You can see the pickup there. Here's how the President framed his argument today.  There was very little inflation, as you know. The numbers were very good. Very much inside the margin. So, we've had no inflation. All we have is we're making a fortune. We are taking in hundreds of billions of dollars.  This all as the president headed to Pennsylvania today for a big economic announcement, more than $90 billion worth of private investment for artificial intelligence and energy. Another priority for the president as he touts the future, investments in AI and data centers. With me now, the Republican congressman from the state of Montana, Ryan Zinke, back with us once again here on the Hill. Nice to have you. Great to be with you, Blake. I'm going to start out of left field here, but it's become a big story in your party.  There was a shift on the president's answer with Epstein. What can he do to satisfy the base?  You know, it's interesting because there was a court case a judge ruled and at the bottom line is I don't believe there's a secret list I don't believe that there's there's this huge volume of information That is some author gonna gonna indict anybody I think that that information more or less is protected by the court to make sure that innocent people or victims You know are not harassed etc. Etc. I think I think it would be helpful to explain all that But but I think Pam Bonnie said a great great job  I mean, the Epstein, everyone's trying to find a nugget that doesn't exist. So I think she's done a great job. I support the president on this. It'd be helpful if they sat down and explained it. Just go before the cameras and explain it.  and said, look, this is where the court is, this is where the judge is, this is where the information is. They've already said there's no secret list in there. There's not a huge issue there. But again, there's a lot of people that believe that somehow there's all this information that's going to lead to somewhere. I don't think it exists.  The president had to defend the economy today, Congressman. Really the first time since April, obviously April 2nd to call it like the 10 days after or whatever, the week after really. Stock market goes into correction territory. There's a lot of worries about tariff, but then markets up into the right and a lot of told you so, but prices now are increasing. And the administration's talking about, yes, we're collecting all these tariffs, but now we see prices going up. How do you not draw a straight line there?  This is the three things that need to happen. One is the economy needs to feel better. It needs to feel better for you, for me, for the consumers. It needs to feel better. Secondly is the tariffs have to lead to trade deals. Having tariffs out there, even though there's more income coming to the Treasury, there's a lot of pain with tariffs too. The tariffs have to lead to trade deals.  So like when he announces Indonesia today, does that move the needle or do Americans at home and say? It's going to have to be further. We're going to have to get a trade deal with the EU. We're going to have to get a trade deal with China. And that movement also will satisfy the last point, is the bond market has to stabilize and interest rates have to go down. If interest rates go down, then you know what? Your mortgage payments are going to go down. We'll be able to refinance. Your car payment is going to go down. I think of the three.  interest rates have to go down, and the bond market doesn't lie. The bond market looks at the reconciliation bill. It's stabilized, but in order for interest rates to go down, which affects everybody. Yeah. We've got to make sure that tariffs then lead into trade deals and the price is stabilized. You were the Interior Secretary in the first administration, and we are seeing now  The president, I talk about this I think more than anyone on television, certainly at this hour, which is AI and data centers, rare earth minerals. We talk about this nonstop. I'm going to bring it up later in the show. The president today touting this $90 billion of investments in AI and data centers all across the country. How do you view that as all of that starts to get built out right now?  Well, the underlying fact is we don't have enough energy to power it. We're talking 1.2 gigawatts. I mean, enormous amount of power. And you look at where China is as far as new power and power availability in the U.S. U.S. has been flat long too long.  data centers, AI, all this is a demand on our power grid, and we're going to have to reconstruct. We're going to have to do something like an FDR New Deal on that scale to bring our energy resources to bear. That means probably nuclear power. You're talking an FDR-like policy. FDR, like a huge effort, and it has to be from the president.  I mean, it has to be a reset on American energy because the demand for energy far outstrips what we presently have. I mean, we have to almost go double what we have in order to keep pace with the data centers, the AI, the demands for power and energy are too great. In China, you look at where China is, I wish I had a graph, China is almost double what we are.  So if they come to you in the state of Montana and say, we're going to take that beautiful land of yours there and we're going to build, build, build, you good with it? Well, you know, the opportunity is micro nuke with nuclear power and making sure that the supply chain is there. We're not going to power the nation on solar cells or wind farm.  We can probably catch up and do a lot better with natural gas as a bridge, but I think the great nirvana, if there is one out there, shore up our coal, shore up our natural gas, but invest in micro-nuclear capability.  modular new capability and make sure we have a supply chain of feeder uranium all the way through. Thorium is probably a possibility. We have the resources in the U.S., we have lithium in the U.S., but we also have to make sure the permitting process allows us to use the power. I gotta leave it there.

Appreciate it. Thanks for coming in tonight. All right, still much more ahead here on the Hill. I think this is a huge story.  The Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Georgia tonight, but not without a little bit of questions. Why is Major League Baseball back in Georgia tonight? Do you remember what they told us back in 2021?  What changed? Plus, empire state of mind. Look who's back in the race for New York mayor, how the former governor, Andrew Cuomo, might shake things up, and what President Trump is saying about him tonight. And a one-way ticket to the swamp? New questions over who is ending up at Alligator Alcatraz. We'll be back here in four minutes, other side of the break. I'm Blake Berman. You are watching The Hill. See you then.  over to Atlanta, Georgia, where the first pitch in Major League Baseball's all-star game, less than two hours away. I want to take you back to 2021, though. Atlanta denied its turn at hosting the game. It's a big deal locally for fans and the local economy. It was denied after a fallout from the voter ID law that, at the time, President Biden even compared to Jim Crow 2.0.  This is Jim Crow on steroids what they're doing in Georgia and 40 other states. What it's all about. Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote. Can't do that.  Come on. Now, the law required photo ID in order to vote absentee by mail, created Dropbox limitations, reduced early voting as well. Democrats and many athletes condemned the measure, including big names like Derek Jeter and LeBron James and the MLB commissioner. Rob Manfred ultimately moved the game to Colorado, saying, I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star game. Now, despite the law, here's the thing. In politics and sports, there's always a scorecard.  Voter turnout in Georgia in the 2024 presidential election reached an all time high, 68.3%. With me now is the Georgia State Senator Greg Dolezal. He is a representative in Forsyth County that is northeast of Atlanta. Thanks for being with us tonight. So I, nothing's changed.  Greg, since 2021, they're in your home state. And I'm sitting there watching the All-Star, the home run contest last night, and I'm thinking to myself, wait a minute, I'm old enough to remember when Joe Biden said this was Jim Crow 2.0 and Major League Baseball said, see ya.

Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams, Zoran Mamdani, all running to become mayor. And President Trump weighing in today. I'll tell you what he said when The Hill returns.  I think Andrew would have a good shot at winning. He's got to run a tough campaign. You know, he's running against the communists. I would think that he would have a good shot at winning.  All right, President Trump weighing in on the New York City mayoral race earlier today, telling the former governor, Andrew Cuomo, to go for it, despite losing the Democratic primary last month to the Democratic Socialist, Zoran Mamdani. Cuomo now joins the current mayor, Eric Adams, who's also running as an independent by launching a third-party bid. The November general election, give or take four months away, but this race has gained national attention given that a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist, Mamdani,  Defeated a well-known former governor with many wondering if this is just kind of a one-off as a New York thing or if it's a sign of a shift in the Democratic Party.  You know him, he's the man behind the numbers, Scott Trenner, data science director over at DDHQ. Hello, hello. How's it going? Trump says Cuomo, go for it.

All right, so as Mom Donny prepares for the November general election, he met with more than 100 business executives today behind closed doors, and tomorrow,  I don't know if he's going to take the Acela if he flies, however he gets down here. We'll find out. He will be here in Washington, D.C. attending a breakfast hosted by New York's Democratic Congresswoman and arguably his biggest backer, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The invitation is titled, Communication and Organizing Skillshare. Mamdani says this is part of his way of giving New Yorkers what they want, a different kind of politics. What we saw  was New Yorkers' hunger for a new kind of politics, a politics focused on working people. I understand that it is difficult for the former governor  to come to terms with that. Because it is a repudiation of the politics that he has practiced, that he has known for so many years. Joining me now, Kurt Bardell, a Democratic strategist, News Nation contributor, and Mark Short, who is the Chairman of Advancing American Freedom, former White House Director of Legislative Affairs, Chief of Staff to Mike Pence as well. With us tonight, hello to you both, thanks for being here. I had to chuckle a little bit, Mamdani trying to meet with Wall Street business executives in New York.  because they're running for the hills. They are worried about him if he gets in. But then he's coming down here tomorrow as well to meet with A. O. C. What do you make of those numbers that trainer just tick through? I mean, if you're him, you're you're feeling pretty good. You're the only person that's in this race actually has higher favorables in  and unfavorables, and like Scott said, Adams, I don't know what you think you're doing, but you are not gonna win this race, and in fact, you're just gonna end up splitting the vote with Cuomo, which really opens the door for Mondani. And again, I would say, too, if he's gonna be in D.C. tomorrow, he should drop on by the Hill Nation Summit and make some news. We'll be there. What's your side of the aisle gonna do when there's the images of AOC and Mamdani together here in Washington?  Well, I think that, look, that's just what is candy for Republicans. You got two socialists out there basically advocating the government should take over the grocery stores in New York, that they should abolish NYPD. I mean, that's exactly where Republicans have painted a picture of where the Democrat Party has gone, and they're walking right into that. Here was President Trump earlier today when asked about that breakfast.  I'd love to be. I'd really love to go. I mean, I look forward to meeting them both. I know them both very well through what I read and through what I see. Look, he's a communist. I don't think our country is ready for a communist, but we're going to see.

How much do you think he is going to try to elevate Mamdani, Mark?  I think all Republicans will. I'm not going to just be the President.

Of the five or six, I'm not sure I really want to do them. You know, you want somebody that knows how to negotiate. But we'll probably have two or three. You know, we insist on opening up the country, which is a big deal. Indonesia was great. He's a great president.  And we made a terrific deal where they opened up the entire country to trade with the United States. We weren't allowed to go in and trade. I think something similar will happen with, I would say, India. And we have a couple of others.  But I have to tell you, for the most part, I'm very happy with the letters. You know, the letters are a deal. You know, I can't explain it any better. The letters are a deal. The press doesn't want to pick that up. But I will veer from those deals on occasion when somebody is willing, like if Japan would open up their country. They don't do that. They just don't do that. And I don't either \u2014 I don't subscribe to it one way or the other.  But they won't do that. So, we might just stick with the letter. South Korea is inclined to maybe do that. So, we'll let you know. But we have letters out. Every time I send out a letter, essentially, that's a deal. The Press- Mr. President, on your predecessor, the date that you gave him, August 1st. But the date that you gave him, August 1st- Right. Why stick with the date if you're saying that- Payments start on August 1st. Right.  The only thing about that's really sacred about August 1st is that's when payments start. So they have to start paying billions of dollars to you and people. Are you a citizen of the country? All right, good. You'll be very happy because you're going to be getting a lot of money.  just like they found a budget surplus. We have a budget surplus of $25 billion. Everyone said, how did that happen? It hasn't happened in many years. It happened because of good management and tariffs.  Well, I might. I don't think it matters how much you release of the deal. We have a Vietnam deal, and I would say that that deal is being pretty well set. It's pretty well set. Again, that's an opening of their country. They've opened it up. Just so you know, these were closed countries. They were wonderful people, wonderful leaders, very strong, smart leaders. But their countries were closed to us, but our country wasn't closed to them.  And so I said, you got to open up your country. So we're going to see. But the Vietnam deal, we may open it. I mean, I don't know. I can't tell you. Is it necessary? Yeah, I don't think so. I don't think it's I don't think it's a long time.  I think, really, the question should be asked, why did Biden get us into that ridiculous war? Why did Biden bring us here? That should never, ever have happened, that war. This is Biden's war. I'm just trying to end it, because we're saving a lot of lives. A lot of opinions change very rapidly.  Might not be 50 days. Might be much sooner than 50 days. They're already being shipped. They're coming in from Germany and then replaced by Germany. And in all cases, the United States gets paid back in full.  So what's happening, as you know, is the European Union, if you look, mostly European Union stuff, but let's put it in the form of NATO. It's very similar. But NATO is going to pay us back for everything. In some cases, we're going to be paid back by countries of the European Union directly.  But we're always getting our money back in full. So we're not going to have any more investment to make. We're getting our money back in full. And if we can make a deal, that'd be great. We're saving 5,000 or 6,000 soldiers a week. They're Russian and they're Ukrainian soldiers. They're not American soldiers. And we won't have boots on the ground.  But it's a shame. 5,000. Last week, they say 7,100 soldiers, both Russian and Ukraine, were killed. Well, they want to talk. I'm in no rush to talk. They would like to talk. I'm in no rush to talk because we obliterated their site. They'd have to start all over. In fact,  It's obliterated to the point that it's not usable anymore. They'd have to pick a different mountain. That mountain is so blown up inside and so unstable that they would have to pick a different mountain. Our people really did the job. Yes, please. On the Fed, sir, would you fire Jerome Powell over the Treasury Foundation? Well, he spent $2.5 million building this place. I have to say this.  I think he's terrible. I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him as a guy that needed a palace to live in. You talk to the guy, it's like talking to nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality, no high intelligence, no nothing. But the one thing I would have never guessed is that he would be spending two and a half billion dollars  to build a little extension onto the Fed. Nobody's ever seen, I think it sort of is, because if you look at his testimony to the House and the Senate, you take a look at the testimony, it's under earthed. That whole thing is, he's not, you know, he's not talking about the problem. It's a big problem. Two and a half billion, and that's two and a half billion now.  That's going to be a lot more money than $2.5 billion to expand. And with all of that to house thousands of people to give him information, and yet out of the 71 economists, and they included me, me and one other person got it right. I got it right, and one other genius got it right.  They had \u2014 everybody else was wrong. Sixty-nine were wrong, and two were right. I was one of them. And I don't have a lot of people. I have hours. I have \u2014 Doug, I have a few people. He has thousands of people, and he got it wrong. No, I think when you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's pretty disgraceful.

It was an impossible deal to make with the Congo. I made that. I made all of these deals, Serbia, Kosovo. And here's the one deal. And actually, Vladimir called me up. He said, I'd love to help you with respect to making a deal with a couple of them, like Iran. I'd love to help you. I say, Vladimir, I only want to help with one deal, Russia, because you're the only deal that we're not doing too well on.  He oftentimes, oftentimes, he said, no, he wants peace. And I think he does. I hope he does. We're going to find out soon. And it could be before the 50 days. President, twice yesterday, when you were talking about this, you mentioned conversations you had with the first lady after talking with President Putin. Has she influenced your thinking on this at all? She's very smart.  She's very neutral. She's very neutral in a sense. She's sort of like me. She'd like to see people stop dying. You know, people said, are you for one side or another? I'm for the side of people stopping dying. We have 5,000, 6,000 and 7,000 people a week, at least. And that doesn't include people from the cities and towns that have  having rockets lobbed in there. I mean, people are dying in the cities and towns, too, but we're talking about 7,100 in the last eight days died. And I'm for stopping that. On the Fed chair, sir, is Scott Vessen, your Treasury Secretary, your number one option whenever Jerome Powell leaves? Well, he's an option and he's very good. Well, he's not because I like the job he's doing.  That's why he's done. I liked his job. I don't know if he was on the plan. Maybe he wasn't. But I do like the job he's done. So, in that sense, probably he's not that much of an option. Scott's been great. He's been terrific. He did a good job today.  He's a very soothing force. You know, it's soothing. All right. Mr. President, the pharmaceuticals will be tariffed probably at the end of the month. And we're going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build. And then we're going to make it a very high tariff because  We got to move them in. Look, there's two ways you do it. You make money and or, and or, you have them move here so they don't have to pay the tariff. Those are the two ways.

I don't understand why they would be so interested. He's dead for a long time. He was never a big factor in terms of life.  I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is. I really don't. And the credible information has been given. Don't forget, we went through years of the Mueller witch hunt and all of the different things, the Steele dossier, which was all fake. All that information was fake. But I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It's pretty boring stuff. It's sordid, but it's boring.

We need a lot of people to work.  You know, we're building, we're going to be building very shortly hundreds of factories, including A.I. We're building a lot of car factories. They're all coming in from other countries now in order to avoid paying the tariffs. And we need people working. So if A.I. can help us with that, that's a positive, because we're not going to have enough workers to take care of it if we don't create something. So whether it's robots or whether it's A.I., we need somebody to take care of. Do you agree with that?  I mean, so many jobs to build. I mean, think about $15 trillion. That's 5 million people working in these factories, building them great, high-paying jobs in America that President Trump has brought back. So those jobs, of course, are in the wings. So let's go, let's train America, and let's get it going.  What would you say about this, John? Well, I think with AI, as Howard and the President said, we're going to need more workers in this country because President Trump is the greatest economic developer that this country's ever had. It's brought back this record amount of foreign direct investment and a record amount of U.S. investment going back into job creation. But the mix is going to change. AI will take jobs away, like software development, because AI can write code, but AI can't wire a building, do plumbing.  If kids go into the trades today, they're all going to be making $150,000, and they'll have amazing lives, build companies, start businesses. I mean, this is part of the boom of America, because middle class, working class, working Americans will never have had it as good. They have lower taxes, more regulations, and more opportunities to go to work to build things.  We need people. We really need, because we're building so many factories in the country, and so AI can help with that. But what also is going to help are going to be robots.

No. You know, the interesting thing is the 12 votes were votes where they wanted it to be stronger in terms of crypto people.  I figured, oh, wow, that's sort of interesting, because I was focused really on today's meeting, not that. But the interesting is the votes, those negative votes, were because they wanted it to be at the same time. They wanted it to be stronger for people with Bitcoin or crypto. They wanted more strength, which is interesting. What do you want to refine in the UK trade deal? We have a little to discuss, but the deal is really very well done. But I'll meet with the prime minister. We have a good relationship.  And I think it's going to be, and it'll be very shortly, and it'll be probably in Aberdeen, Scotland. Which state besides Texas would you like Republicans to gerrymander? Say it again? Which state besides Texas would you like Republicans to redraw the congressional election? Well, there's about four of them. I'll let you figure that one out, but we have about four of them. In three cases, it's one. And in one case, it's two or three.  And Texas would be five. Are you concerned California will turn around and do the same thing? Well, we'll fight them. You know, they're so corrupt in California, you never know what's going to happen. But we've done pretty well on the courts in California, as you see. We're batting about a thousand, ultimately. We start off a little slow and then we get a lot of hits.  Mr. President, you said today at the event in Pittsburgh that if it wasn't for Mr. Ludnick, Mr. Besson, who wanted to do more deals, that you would basically just go with the letters. You said that a few different times. I just want to clarify. Do you just want to go with the tariffs? No, I think they would like to make deals more than me.  I'm satisfied with, but they would like to make deals more than me. I'm not saying that they're wrong. I'm just saying, in my opinion, he and Scott and maybe even Doug, to a certain extent, you're more like me, I think, but they would like to make deals more than me. I'm very happy with the deals the way they are. Those are very, right? Those are very simple deals. It's whatever the percentage is. And we base that on a lot of things, including the deficit and, you know, various things.  You know, I think it's a much faster way. Don't forget, we'll be releasing a letter soon talking about many countries that are much smaller, where you're not going to do letters per se. You might do an individual letter, but it's going to go very quickly. And the number will also be less. These are countries that are  Many of them, you know, like 200 countries. You understand? Caribbean countries, African countries. You have a huge amount of countries that are small, and the President is going to deal with them sort of the way he thinks is the right way to deal with them. We'll probably set one tariff for all of them. Over 10%? Over 10% tariff? Probably a little over 10%, yeah. 15? We don't do a lot of business, but we do, you know, it's still significant.  Mr. President, is that related to your other negotiations? Is that tied up with other issues? No, I think Israel is going to be fine. We had a great victory with Israel. That was a great, great victory. What we did with the B-2 bombers and all of that,  And, you know, I never thought of it, but so many people are thanking me. They say no president had the guts to do it because, you know, this has been going on for 25 years. In fact, when the pilots came to the Oval Office, they said, Sir, we and our predecessors have been working on this attack for 25 years. Have a good time, everybody. Thank you.  All right, we've been listening live there. President Trump, Joint Base Andrews just down the road from us. Thanks for being back with us here on the Hill. I'm Blake Berman. The President, making a little bit of news there, asked about a possible replacement for the Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, and whether it could be his Treasury Secretary, Scott Besant. The President's saying that it is an option, but maybe not necessarily because he likes the job that he is doing over at the Treasury Department. The President also asked about trade deals and that August 1st deadline.  saying maybe there will be five or six, but then winnowed that down saying there probably will be two or three. And then once again today, President Trump asked about Jeffrey Epstein and his administration's handling of the case. The president essentially putting that on Pam Bondi, the attorney general's plate, saying if there is credible info, let them have it.  A lot to digest here in the last few minutes here on The Hill. With me now, Bill Salmon, Senior Vice President of Editorial Content for The Hill and NewsNation. Lindsey Granger, NewsNation contributor. Emily Brooks is a congressional reporter for The Hill. And Mark Short, Mark Short, former Chief of Staff to Vice President Mike Pence. Thanks for sticking around. We listened to the President there for about 20 minutes or so. I want to start with you. You know the President well. What'd you key in on there? I ran through some of the headlines, but what'd you key in on?  I think that one, the tariffs is going to continue to be the biggest agenda item here moving forward. And I think that the Fed issue is still the one that's going to keep rattling markets. I think we continue to forget he actually appointed Jerome Powell. And that was his pick, and primarily because Secretary Mnuchin said he'd be the one to keep rates lowest. Am I right to key in on he sort of  pushed aside the Besson option there a little bit or not necessarily? I think you're right. I think he did. But I think that you continue to see the administration pursuing this notion of extravagant refurbishing just because they're looking for a different angle to put pressure on him. What did you pick up on, Bill? Well, he did say above the Besson, not that much of an option.  So I definitely picked up that that was maybe not, it's one of those things, we love you where you're at. You're too good where you're at, we can't move you. But I thought that he teed up a lot of topics that actually are gonna probably tee up if I may be so self-promotional. There you go, do it, Bill.

Second, he's got NATO involved. If you remember during the Biden administration, there was a ban  on NATO getting involved in any way in Ukraine. We always did it through bilateral or other mechanisms to avoid NATO-izing our response. He's got NATO involved now. That's very positive as well. Third, threatening secondary sanctions. And a lot of people wanted him to just pull the trigger right away. But I think the threat is good, because he's giving Vladimir Putin a warning that his trade partners are going to dry up if he doesn't end the war. And it's actually a signal to China  that they need to start putting pressure on Putin to end the war, or else they're going to start paying higher tariffs for their goods in the U.S. So, this was a set of good measures. And, as you said, Chris, of course, Putin just rejects it. Putin doesn't want to appear to be pressured by the United States.

The second thing is that he complained that Biden didn't have a strategy. Remember, the slogan from the Biden administration was, as long as it takes.  But nobody could tell you what it was. We were just going to do this forever. Trump has flipped that to say we're going to end the war. And he's been pushing relentlessly for a ceasefire. And he's manipulated or maneuvered the U.S. and Ukraine so that we are in alignment.  calling for a cease-fire and having a shared economic interest through this minerals deal. And Putin has become the outlier who's resisting a cease-fire. And now Trump is putting the pressure on Putin. You have to agree to a cease-fire, too.

He had no qualms about it. That is a signal to Putin that, oh, this is actually more coordinated, more unified a Western response than he was expecting. So I think that's a very good thing. And on the long range, until the Russian people and Putin himself feels that they are getting hit where it hurts, they're just going to keep going.  And Ukraine should, and I think has been urged by the United States, to stick to military targets. Don't copy what the Russians do in terms of bombing cities and civilians, but go after fuel depots, go after airfields, go after aircraft, go after drone factories.

In part because this was telegraphed, Jensen was pretty clear that they're gonna find some way forward here.

I've been talking over the past few months with a former trade official that worked with Trump in his first administration around trade, and over the past few months he's really stressed the importance of NVIDIA in the conversations, especially trying to get some of these rare metals.  But the fact that China is willing to use NVIDIA, their junior varsity chips, as a key negotiating piece, the fact that they're willing to accept that, I think really underscores two things. Number one is that US has a substantial lead when it comes to the hardware side.

I went to school here. I went to college here.  and got to know it very well, and the people are the greatest people on earth, so it's a real honor to be here. And I have to say about David and Dina, they had the toughest race there was. I said, this is going to be a tough one. And every campaign stop that I made, we had  Lots of people, tens of thousands would be a small crowd. And I'd invite David and he'd get up and do a fantastic job. And it all worked out. But he won a race that was really not doable. I think it was his opponent was here for a long time. And his father was there for about 50 years, at least total. And those people aren't easy to beat, but you beat him. So I just want to congratulate you. That's amazing.  And he wouldn't have done it without Dina, that I can tell you. We know Dina. Anybody that knows Dina knows exactly what I'm saying. And, you know, he mentioned Butler, but what nobody really talks too much about because they didn't see the order. But I actually looked down to the right before that thing happened. And I said, oh, there's David McCormick. He's running for the Senate. David, come on up.  And there was a little, there were so many people, there was a little problem he had coming up because I said, look, just do it later. And then about a minute later, so, you know, if you would have come up, I don't know what the hell would have happened, right? It worked out better this way, right? I don't know if he would have been around, but let's take, I want to take full credit for that. I said, no, don't bother. We'll do it later. So if I didn't say that, who knows?  But really great job. Exactly one year ago this week, David was at that rally in Pennsylvania. And 12 months later, look at what we have. We have  president. We have really, I mean, if you think about it, we had a country and I just left the NATO leaders. I left the Middle East, the king of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, as you know, Amir, so great and UAE. These are three great leaders. And then we just made a deal with NATO where they pay for everything and we give them  the ammunition and the missiles, and we give them whatever they want. We've got to get that war stopped. It's so bad. But every leader said, no matter where, they all said the same thing to me, some of them separately, but it's the same words, just about. He said, it's amazing. One year ago, you had a dead country. We were dead. We didn't think you could ever come back. And now, today, you have the hottest country anywhere in the world. It's true. It's true.  We're back in Pittsburgh to announce the largest package of investments in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And it's not even close. I don't imagine it's too close. I don't think second is. I don't think second is too close. That's a big statement. This afternoon, 20 leading technology and energy companies are announcing more than $92 billion of investments in Pennsylvania. And if you want, we could probably get him up. Let's talk to him right now.  But this is a really triumphant day for the people of the Commonwealth and for the United States of America. We're doing things that nobody ever thought possible. As of about a month and a half ago, when we came back from the Middle East, we came back with $5.1 trillion of investments from the three countries that I mentioned, and they're great  people, great leaders of those countries. But we came back with many, many planes that they are going to build through Boeing. They came back with a package of goods that were, you know, nobody's seen. I don't think anybody's seen $5.1 trillion. And we are  Now, at about 16, think of this, $16 trillion. And we're at a little bit less than six months, but really, we're probably at three months because it took me a little time to get started, right? So in three and a half, four months, let's say, we have about $16 trillion. There's never been anything like that.  In history, you can go for years and they didn't have numbers like that. And if you look at the last administration, you had negative numbers. You didn't have positive numbers. You're going in the wrong direction. But we have the hottest country and we we're going to keep it that way. Today's commitments are ensuring that the future is going to be designed, built and made right here in Pennsylvania and right here in Pittsburgh. And I have to say, right here in the United States of America.  I want to thank, we have some great talent in the administration. I want to thank and say hello to a few people that are with us. Secretaries Scott Besant, Howard Lutnick, Doug Burgum,  Chris Wright, you know, Chris Wright's very friendly with the people up here. Doug, I wanted Doug for energy. I didn't know about Chris. And Doug said, no, I have somebody that's much better than me. Right. Doug never said that in his life. You have to know. I said, this guy must be very good. But what a team they are. You know, we.  We have one controls the land and one controls the energy, but it was sort of intertwined. So we put them together, right? We never even discussed who's supposed to be the leader of the pack. But boy, you are. It was one instruction. Drill, baby, drill. Right. And they are drilling. They are drilling.  We have the EPA administrator, probably, I must say this, Doug, I hate to say it, Chris and Doug and all of you guys, the most important man on the dais today is Lee Zeldin. It's called environmental protection because he's going to be the one that gets you a permit.  He's going to get you a permit for the largest electric producing plant in the world in about a week, would you say? Now, if you go if you go nuclear, I promised him I'd give him two weeks. OK, nuclear. We'll give him a little more time. But, you know, the biggest problem we've had is takes years and years to get permits. And he really is. He's a phenomenal guy.  And, you know, his history is a great lawyer, great congressman in a race that was, according to most unwinnable, almost won for governor, just missed it by a few points. And he's really fantastic. But he's  Essentially, the Environmental Protection Agency, the top man, and he's got things rocking and already they're building plants and they have their permits. These are permits that would have taken you literally 10 years to get, or I would really say 10 years before they voted against you, because that's really what was happening. And it's crazy all over the country, but we're we're freeing it up.  And he really is going to be able to produce. And I'm looking at the numbers of China where they're producing a lot of electric. Well, they only have one man they have to worry about. Our friend President Xi, he can do that by himself. I don't know if I can. Do I have the right to overrule you? Maybe. I don't know. Probably I do, but I won't have to. But so he has one man and we have one man. The one man is sitting right there. We appreciate you doing an amazing job. They're building plants already and they have  They're building plants and they have already their permits and I have to take it, I have to brag just for a second because  when I first heard about AI. You know, it's not my thing. Although my uncle was at MIT, one of the great professors, 51 years, whatever. He was the longest-serving professor in the history of MIT, three degrees in nuclear, chemical, and math. That's a smart man. Kaczynski was one of his students. Do you know who Kaczynski was? There's very little difference between a madman and a genius.  But Kaczynski, I said, what kind of a student was he, Uncle John, Dr. John Trump? He said, what kind of a student? And then he said, seriously, good. He said he'd correct, he'd go around correcting everybody, but it didn't work out too well for him. Didn't work out too well, but it's interesting in life. But I will say this, that we have the greatest brains, we have the greatest power, and we are going to have more electric. I said to some of the guys coming in, they wanted to hook up to the grid.  I spoke to Mark and Jeff and a lot of people. And they said, well, we want to know about the electric because I was told we'll need from David. The first one, you're the first one that told me. That's why I hired him, because I said he told me something I didn't know. He said, you need double the electric of what we have right now and maybe even more than that. Remember that? And I said, what are you kidding? And that's double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it. And actually, the number that was even low. You need more than that.  And to do that, you'd have to hook up to an old grid, in many cases broken and certainly very much open to destruction from bombs and planes and from, frankly, storms. You see what happened, that horrible situation in Texas. And you'd be subject to that.  And it's fragile, but it is old, and it can't have the capacity unless you totally rebuild it. That would take decades. And I said, well, why don't we do this? Why don't we, when you build your plant, wherever you may build it, you build your own electric plant. And nobody took it seriously. They sort of looked like, I can't really take that seriously, because they didn't believe it was happening. So the smartest people, some of them on stage right now, were saying, huh.  And then they say, well, how do we hook up to the grid? We want to hook up. They didn't believe what I was saying. And I said, no, no, I'm really serious. I'm going to let you build rightly and let you build with your plant. You're going to build. We'll make you like a public utility. You're going to build your own Con Edison in New York. You're going to build your own electric factory and you're going to make your own electricity.  So this way you can have a great plant. And what you'll do is if you have excess, you can sell it back into the grid. You'll even make money from the electric business because these guys do know how to make money. They'll end up doing things that will be shocking. And you're going to make your own plan. So when I looked at the numbers before, I saw a board outside and it said how much electricity China's making. Well, we just started.  But we're going to actually end up doing more than them, and it's going to be done privately, and you're going to own your own electric plants. And they'll be powered by maybe nuclear, maybe gas, maybe coal. You know, we brought coal back in. They won't be powered by wind because it doesn't work. I hate to say it just doesn't work. It's rather intermittent. You don't want it. It causes a lot of problems. But we have every form of  fuel that you want to use for your plant and you'll build a plant you'll build your electric and this way you have no excuses because I didn't want to be the one that said listen we're trying to build that grid in 10 years from now and you wouldn't be able to open you're gonna build it with your own plants and so people heard that and  They couldn't believe it. And finally, now they believe it because we have a couple that are already started and they're building their electric plants along with their separate plant. And in fact, some of them are building the electric plant inside of their main building. So it's really exciting to see. But I was very, very proud of that, actually. White House A.I. czar David Sachs. David, thank you very much. Great job.  David interviewed me on his podcast about, what's that now, two years ago or something in San Francisco. And I said, this guy's very smart. If I pull this sucker off, I'm going to probably hire him in some form. I got to get him in. But you've been doing great. Thank you, David, very much. Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Michael Kratios. Michael, thank you. Thank you, Michael. Thank you, Michael. Good job.  They tell me you're doing great. Thank you very much. As well as State Senate President Pro Tem Kim Ward. Kim, thank you. Kim, good job. Kim's very happy right now. State Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman. Joe, thank you. And State Senator Greg Rothman. Thank you very much, Greg. Thank you.  I also want to recognize your great congressman. These are friends. These are warriors. They just passed the great, big, beautiful. See, I had the word great, I like to say, because it really was really supposed to be great, big, beautiful. They call it the big beautiful. But I had great. They took the word great out.  I was on a show called Deface the Nation or something like that. Ladies and gentlemen, Deface the Nation. And I said, I want a great, big, beautiful bill. And they named it that. And it really is. It was supposed to be seven bills. Could have been two or three, but it was supposed to be originally seven.  I said, let's put them all together. And if you put them all together, there's going to be something for everybody. And that's what happened. And we got it passed. And Republicans said we didn't get one Democrat vote. Think of it. The biggest tax cut in history. And we didn't get a Democrat vote and so many other things. No tax on tips.  No tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime. But the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, you got that, also the biggest deduction. You know, you have a 10-year period. Last time we had a one-year period. Now you have a 10-year period. And that's what made the first one. We had the most successful economy in the history of our country during my first term.  And we had the we passed a bill, but that bill, honestly, as good as it was, was nothing compared to this one. And the biggest thing and the biggest reason for the success was the deduction. And you're allowed to do it. And this time we're including structure. So you're able to deduct those big structures that you're building. So nobody thought that was even possible. But I want to introduce the people that did it. Dan Muser is here. Where's Dan?  Dan, you. Oh, they're in Washington working on our next bill. Good. They shouldn't be here. Now I don't have to mention their names. Although they're watching on television, I guarantee. Oh, that's right. They're working on our next one, which is coming for a vote, I think, on Friday. Wow. I'm impressed. But JT, GT Thompson, Lloyd Schmucker, John Joyce, Mike Kelly, Scott Perry.  Rob Bresnahan, all terrific people, and Guy Reschenthaler. These are great people. They're warriors. They fought with us. They voted with us. We only had two negative votes. I didn't invite those two guys to anything.  We had a guy named Rand Paul Jr. He's known as Rand Paul Jr. in the House. He always votes no. We had somebody else. They did him a big favor. And I said, well, he's not going to, sir, I don't think so and so is going to vote. I won't mention his name. And I said, no, he's going to vote because I did him a very big, big favor, very personal favor.  as big as you can get, having to do with death and life. But having to do, no, he's going to vote, don't worry about it. Okay, sir, if you tell me, but I don't think we're going to get his vote. Don't worry about it. I said, I know what I'm talking about. Don't worry about it. And sure as hell, he voted against us. And I said, another one, another great move by Trump. Anyway, so much for favors. You know, it's welcome to the world of politics, right? Right, David? We know about that.  But we're here today because we believe that America's destiny is to dominate every industry and be the first in every technology. And that includes being the world's number one superpower in artificial intelligence. And we are way ahead of China. I have to say, we're way ahead of China. And the plants are starting up, the construction is starting up.  And did you notice that two days ago, they just announced that they had a budget surplus of $25 billion in this country, right, Howard? They never saw anything like that. Everyone would say, where did that, that's been like decades, $25 billion, and that's peanuts compared to what it's, and it's good business practices. The tariffs are coming in by the hundreds of billions of dollars, and they haven't, they're really at the infant stage right now. It's only on cars and steel, mostly.  And the rest is starting to kick in. We just made a deal today, a big one with Indonesia, a great deal. And they've opened up Indonesia fully. You know, Indonesia really has great copper, very, very powerful copper, but they have a lot of things. And we have full access to Indonesia.  We'll soon be announcing probably, I don't, you know, if we do, we do. If we don't, that's okay, too. I don't mind because I'm very happy with the letters that we send out that you'll be paying X percent. I almost like it better if you want to know the truth. But Scott and Howard, you know, they like to go the old fashioned way. Let's work hard to make a deal. I don't know. There's something about pay is 35 percent of everything. And we're very happy. But I think India is going to open up and a lot of countries are going to open up.  And some that don't, they'll just be paying a very substantial tariff, but peanuts compared to what they should be paying. So we have some amazing things. China and other countries are racing to catch up to America, having to do with AI. And we're not going to let them do it. We have the great chips. We have the great everything. And we're going to be fighting them in a very friendly fashion. I have a great relationship with President Xi.  And we smile at the back and forth. But we are leading. I heard somebody say before that we're going to try and catch China. We're not catching them. We're leading. And one of the advantages they have is they show the electric that they have it. They're opening up coal-fired plants all over the place. And we're entitled and allowed now to do that, too. We took coal. It was taken out of the chain. And coal is actually a very, very powerful. I say you're not allowed to call it coal.  You have to call it clean, beautiful coal. You're not allowed, John, to call it just coal, because people don't understand. We call it clean, beautiful coal. But China is \u2014 I think they're going to be very far behind. Mark my words, I think they're going to be very far, because these are \u2014 we have a lot of places going up right now, and they're all going to be great. And they actually feed off each other.  But remaining the world's leader in AI will require an enormous increase in the energy production. And that's taking place. And you're doing it yourself on a massive build out of physical infrastructure and the tremendous technology skill that Pennsylvania has. I mean, you have tremendous skill in this state.  Today, the Commonwealth is reclaiming its industrial heritage and taking its place at the forefront of the AI technological revolution. And as I said before, it's an expression I used all during the campaign and screamed it out. We'll drill, baby, drill. And people went crazy.  We had big crowds, as you probably heard, biggest ever, biggest in history. The investments being announced this afternoon include more than $56 billion in new energy infrastructure and more than $36 billion in new data center projects. And a lot more than that are going to be announced in the coming weeks, not even months. I think we could say weeks, right, Howard?  In the campaign, I promised that I would save the Homer City power plant 50 miles east of here that Joe Biden's Green New Scam forced to shut down. It's a Green New Scam, greatest scam in history, the greatest in history. Well, the auto pen, I think, is a bigger scam, if you want to. Actually, I do believe that today we're pleased to report that a 15 billion dollar investment from Nighthead Capital Management. Who's here from Nighthead?  Well, I'm very impressed with that. Fifteen billion. That's pretty good. That's a great location, too. Wow. That's very impressive. Thank you very much. That's a big number, huh? It's a big number. And yet it's peanuts relative to water. That's a good job. But the Homer city site is being resurrected as the largest natural gas fired power plant ever to be built in North America. Is that right? That's fantastic.  As another example, Google will be investing billions and billions of dollars to revitalize two major hydropower facilities in Pennsylvania. Congratulations. Say hello to Sergey and Sundar. They've done a pretty good job at Google, I'll tell you.  And they have their star right here. So congratulations. That's really fantastic. And under the last year of Biden, China added 11 times as much power generation capacity, as did the United States. That's under Biden. That's not under Trump. That's under Sleepy Joe. Under the Trump administration, America is getting back in the game. And we're going to actually be doing more than they do. As as I said,  And on day one, I ended the Green New Scam. I also ended Joe Biden's war on clean, beautiful Pennsylvania coal. Totally ended it. Coal has equal, if not greater status. It's a very powerful. It's a very powerful thing called China. It's sort of interesting that China makes windmills. But how many wind farms do you see in China? I haven't seen any lately.  sort of crazy. They buy, they build the windmills, sell them into our country, sell them all over the world, and they ruin their fields and ruin their valleys. And then you look at China, where's your wind farm? Well, we, uh, we have one. We're thinking about one. No, it's, uh, the whole thing is crazy, but they use coal and they're building right now about 52 power plants, all of coal. I signed historic executive orders to expedite construction of brand new nuclear power plants, which is very hot.  We've issued an order, as you probably know, one month ago, making it very easy and very safe to build nuclear power in Westinghouse, I know is represented here and there, become a whole brand new Westinghouse. Congratulations. It's a great thing you're doing.  They were hurt by some very incompetent people. I watched what was going on there in the form of regulators. They were really doing a number. Our regulators are the opposite. We'll be very safe, but we're fast and safe. And you're going to get a whole different group of people. But it's announcing plans to build 10 state-of-the-art nuclear reactors.  in the United States. That's great. Congratulations to Westinghouse. And to further accelerate investment in the industries of tomorrow. Two weeks ago, we enacted the largest tax cuts in American history. When I signed that one big, beautiful bill into law, we're adding to it a little bit, and we're refining it a little bit all to the positive. And that's why the congressman I'll pretend I'm really angry at them, but I would actually be angry at them if they  showed up Lee, right? I'd be much more, if they're here, I would not be happy. The bill allows 100% expensing on all new equipment, something that's never happened before. Factories, research, and as I said before, even structure. To further protect Pennsylvania industry, two months ago I came here to announce my approval of a historic investment deal with Nippon Steel, Nippon Steel of Japan, to keep U.S. Steel right here in Pittsburgh.  And we have a great woman here, Selina Zito. She's the writer. She writes on the Rust Belt and the Midwest, really, but the Rust Belt, anything having to do with rust and belt. Where is Selina? Is she around there someplace? Because I'm doing an interview with her in a little while. And I said, do me a favor. Let me do the interview after this. This way we can be right on time. Where is Selina?  Oh, she's great. You can't be angry at me now, Selina, because I'll be with you. I said, Selina, can we make it after? Otherwise, we're going to keep a lot of money waiting. These people have big money. When I saw the people here, I said, Selina, I'm sorry. I have to delay this. And also, Miss McAdams. Where is Miss McAdams? We're going to do one with her, too. And she's great with Fox. And she's been fantastic. Stand up. Stand up. Young and smart and vibrant.  She's been very you've done a great job. So I'll see you in a couple of minutes. That's great. We can't keep this kind of money waiting. These are the biggest. These are truly the biggest investors in the world, including my friend John on my left. But these are the biggest investors in the world. I'm sorry, McAdams. And I'm sorry, Salina. We just that's the way it works. It's very impressive. But Nippon Steel and we got it and we have  all sorts of protections because of the fact that U.S. Steel was, you people, years ago, 80 years ago, was the biggest company in the world, most powerful company in the world. And we were very strong. And Nippon's coming in. They're going to be investing $17 billion. They're going to build new plants all over the country using U.S. Steel. And we have the absolute control because we don't want to lose control of that one name.  That one name is very important for the to the history of this country. And I think Nippon is going to do a fantastic job. And, you know, in some cases, they could take it back to their country. I said to people, because a lot of people said, well, what do you think? Japanese companies coming in? I said, well, you know, when they spend a billion dollars in a steel plant, they're not going to put it on a boat and take it away. It's going to be right here with us no matter what. But they are going to do a fantastic job.  And they look forward to it, and they're so excited about it. They actually fought very, very hard to get that deal. And I think when you look at the countless jobs at the Mon Valley Works in Western Pennsylvania, we have something that's going to be really incredible. And we did keep a golden share. You know who has the golden share? I do. I have the golden. Does everybody know what a golden share? A lot of these people from the Middle East, they don't have to worry about golden shares.  But we have a golden share, but Nippon's going to do a fantastic job. With that historic announcement and the new commitments being made today, we're building a future where American workers will forge the steel, produce the energy, build the factories, and really run  a country like, I believe, like this country has never been run before. I think we have a true golden age for America. We've been showing it and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world. And I'm honored to be in Pennsylvania and I'm honored to be in Pittsburgh and  You're going to see some real action here. So get ready. Lots of jobs, lots of success. Really, a beautiful thing is it's going to be beautiful to behold. So enjoy yourselves. And I look forward to hearing some of your geniuses speak, if that's OK. I'll stay around. All right. OK."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1656.74, "text": "Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you so much. Again, thank you for being here. And you coming has allowed us to have this incredible summit. It won't surprise you, this summit was Dina's idea. But what it's allowed us to do is catalyze the investment. It's allowed us to get a lot of attention on Pennsylvania's story. And it's allowed us to deliver on the promises you and I talked about, which is jobs for working families really create opportunity here in Pennsylvania. So, it's the manifestation of your agenda.  And we're going to talk today about those $90 billion of investment. You'll hear from Blackstone and QTS, Corweave and others. They pledged $36 billion to build data centers. You'll also hear from companies that invested tens of billions in generating the power  needed to run those data centers. We have great investments in natural gas production and pipelines, but also in nuclear. Brookfield's repowering of two hydro facilities with Google that you mentioned. The great Pittsburgh company Westinghouse will tell you how they're going to deliver on your call to strengthen America's nuclear power industrial base by placing 10 reactors under construction by 2030. And Constellation, which is here, Joe Dominguez,  is upgrading Limerick Clean Energy Center to bring an additional 340 megawatts online. First Energy and Pennsylvania's PPL have collectively pledged $20 billion to build and operate the grid infrastructure required to support a data center renaissance right here in Pennsylvania.  and to ensure that ratepayers don't foot the bill. And finally, you've got technology companies like Google, they're investing and bringing the benefits of AI to Main Street, and their AI Works for Pennsylvania initiative, which will offer AI training for one million small businesses.  The great thing about today is these are not empty promises. These are tangible, real commitments, and they're only the beginning. The distinguished leaders you have around the table here, from Larry Fink to Darren Woods, from Toby Rice to Bruce Flatt,  to great global investors like my good friends Chow Kit from Singapore, Haldun Al-Babarik from the United Arab Emirates. They've traveled long distances to witness firsthand this historic moment and to see firsthand what's happening in Pennsylvania. And these investments are a testament to Pennsylvania's unique resources. Unbelievable natural gas reserves, abundant fresh water, a massive installed base of nuclear power, incredible tech universities like  CMU, our host today. Thank you, Farnam. Amazing skilled trade engineers represented by Pennsylvania's own Rob Bayer and Brandon Bishop here of the National Building Trades. But none of this would have happened. None of this would have happened without your unwavering commitment to unleashing American energy dominance and standing up for workers in Pennsylvania and across the nation.  They're going to see those workers tangible job opportunities here today. These projects will create tens of thousands of construction jobs and thousands of well-paying direct and indirect jobs supporting these projects, supporting these industries. It's going to make a big difference in Pennsylvania communities. So, Mr. President, this is the beginning of an economic renaissance for Pennsylvania and a huge step forward. And I want to thank you for making it possible."}], "keywords": ["Trump"], "summary": {"Aaron McLaughlin": null, "Adrian Broadus": null, "Al Roker": null, "Albert Bourla": null, "Alexander Bolton": null, "Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Andy_Harris": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill Ferries": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brian_Moynihan": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Camila Bernal": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": "Donald Trump delivers a speech touting his administration's achievements, including economic growth, tax cuts, and energy policies.
