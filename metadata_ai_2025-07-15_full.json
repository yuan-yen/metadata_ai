Obviously, we make the best weapons systems.  in the world, and everyone wants them, and we're going to prioritize those going to Ukraine. And what this says also to Vladimir Putin, I think, is very loud and clear, which is, you know, we've given you a chance for peace. President Trump is a peacemaker. But if you want war, we will arm Ukraine, and Europe will pay for it. And it's actually, I think, a great step in ultimately bringing this war to a conclusion, to an end. You know, in the last 18 months,  Russia has gained about 1% of Ukrainian land. I mean, they're making no success. They're losing thousands of soldiers every single day. And way too many private citizens in Ukraine and the big cities are being injured. So I think this is a great next step in finally ending this war.

But this is a natural progression of what we did in The Hague at the NATO summit, too.  We move the burden off the American taxpayer for European defense and on to European taxpayers, where it should be. And the traditional defense of Europe is now going to be borne by the European population. And at the same time, we're doing the same thing with the Ukrainian war. President Trump said today $350 billion of American taxpayer money has gone to support Ukraine. No longer. But at the same time, we're not cutting them off from weapons, and we're also  also not making the United States of America less secure.

You know, I've seen some of those manufacturing things like in Lima, Ohio, where they build tanks, for example.

Alec Murdoch's surviving son, Buster, who you saw in court if you followed the case, released a statement after the family of Stephen Smith raised money to exhume his body and conduct an independent autopsy. So you may be asking, what is this case? Who is Stephen Smith? Well, his death in 2015 was ruled a hit and run.  after he was found in the middle of the road, not far from the Murdoch's family property, Moselle, where the bodies of Maggie and Paul were found. Authorities reopened this investigation years later in 2021 after uncovering some information while investigating the deaths of Maggie and Paul. Well, a recently released documentary on Netflix suggests that Smith and Murdoch's oldest son, Buster, may have had some sort of relationship. Well, we haven't heard from Buster until  Now, he is speaking out this morning, and he is releasing a statement saying, in part, these baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false. I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death, and my heart goes out to the Smith family. I am requesting that the media immediately stop publishing these defamatory comments and rumors about me.  Joining us this morning, criminal defense attorney and legal analyst, Jonna Spillbore. She followed the Murdoch double murder trial with us, and now we've got this other case. Thanks for being here. You know, for those of us who know all of the different layers to this case, Stephen Smith was a big part of this investigation early on. And the fact that this case got reopened, we still don't yet know what the evidence was that prompted them to take a second look at this, do we?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 124.872, "text": " No, we don't. But let's take a look at what we do know. And I think we should make clear that we are not on the cusp of a Murdoch mystery Netflix series sequel right now. What we have here is not the authorities requesting that the body of Stephen Smith be exhumed and another autopsy performed. This is being done privately by Sandy Smith, Stephen's mother. Now, we cannot blame Sandy for wanting to do this.  She, I'm sure, tuned into the Murdoch murder trial as well. She's had questions about whether or not her son was the victim of an accident, an accidental hit and run, or something worse. So she's basically been able to garner some sympathy and create a GoFundMe to create the funds, because this is not a cheap date. In order to exhume somebody, it's costly to hire a private person to do a second autopsy. It is expensive.  So she's going to go ahead and do that for her own satisfaction. What could possibly come from this? Maybe nothing. Or if there is some information that perhaps was overlooked back in 2015, Sandy Smith can bring that to the authorities sled and say, look what I have here. Now, what are you going to do with this new information?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 202.784, "text": " So it's been eight years though, John.

And we do not know how badly decomposed her son's body is going to be. It may reveal absolutely nothing new. In fact, sometimes when you have a situation like this, specifically,  We know that there was trauma to Stephen Smith's head and body. So that part is not going to change. What could possibly change is if they didn't do some toxicology testing, for example, and maybe there is enough tissue that's still intact for them to do that. But I really think that's going to lead down a road to nowhere.  And let's be specific here. Really what she's looking for is to tie specifically Buster Murdoch to the death of her son Stephen Smith. And right now there really is nothing but speculation. We have no more information than we did back then except for the fact  that we know that the Murdoch family reign is over. And maybe people might want to come forward with information now that they didn't want to come forward with in 2015, but that has nothing to do with the condition of the body or what they'll find in a second autopsy."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 289.454, "text": " All right, how about some inside scoop in a NewsNation exclusive.

Let's please welcome back Alex's attorney, Jim Griffin. Counselor, thank you for taking the opportunity. Happy to be here, Chris.  So help me understand the big obvious question. Why would a guy who knows he's a target want to go to a place where he can be victimized? Well, Chris, Alec is a guy who does not want to be isolated in a cell 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In protective custody, it's not like that. But it's pretty isolated.  He wants to contribute. There are a lot of things that he can do in the general population. I mean, he's a lawyer, he's a college-educated person, and there are programs where he can assist with. He has heard from the prison officials that there have been threats against him. He's not received those directly. He had some threats when he was in the county jail, but  but he was able to navigate through that. You know, anytime you're in prison and you're a name like he is, you're gonna be challenged. And he had been challenged at the county jail, but he was able to overcome and develop relationships. And he was productive in the county jail. And he think he can be productive in the general population. I mean, he would rather take his chances on the yard than right away in a cell, to be honest with you.  Let's talk about what that says about his state of mind right now. First of all, do you think that he's got a little bit of a death wish? Yes, he's hanging out with cops and sexual predators and other people they put in protective custody, but he's outside the box most of the day in their company. Do you think that he wants to get hurt? No, absolutely not. I mean, Alec had, he had, you know,  the death wish, death attempt back in Labor Day of 2021. And from that day since, he has been a man who has been sober, and he has been rational, and he plans to continue. He looks forward to the day of getting out of prison. We've gotten an appeal pending. We're very hopeful of the appeal. He's a lawyer. He saw how things went. And so,  he is not someone who has given up hope. He has hope for the future. He has hope he will get out one day and he definitely does not have a death wish. Now you don't dispute that Alec Murdoch has heard on that video, nor do you dispute that that, um, makes his initial reckoning about where he was and when false. Your argument is, but he doesn't sound like a killer in it. Am I right? Correct. Um, now why isn't the lie enough, Jim?  Well, first, I mean, the lie is clearly problematic. In and of itself, it's a lie. In and of itself, it puts him down at the kennels at 844. But in and of itself, it doesn't mean he killed them. What you have to buy into is that they were dead at 848 or 849.  And that's the whole cell phone data that if someone is found dead, you know, an hour and a half after they last used their phone, then they are dead when they stop using their phone last. That was the state's whole time of death analysis. And we pushed back on that really hard. And that juror obviously disregarded it. And it seemed like all the other jurors disregarded it. And they were, you know,  the one juror that you played the interview of was more convinced that he did it because he lied about being down there. I mean, that was problematic. And the way we addressed it is put Alec on the stand, and by the time he testified, he was a lying, cheating, stealing lawyer who would steal money from his own mother and grandmother, you know, and the view of the evidence that was in front of the jury.  When that juror said he never cried, he could not have been talking about never crying about Paul and Maggie because he bawled the whole time on the stand.  In fairness to that juror, he was talking about he never cried about stealing money from his clients. I assume that's what it's about."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 608.061, "text": "Well, or even this.

Uh, do you believe it was the wrong move to put him on the stand? Looking back on it? Um, actually no, and that may surprise people, but, but it changed from day to day. But frankly, Chris,  At the time of appointing the trial where we had to make that decision, all the bad act evidence was already before the jury. One reason, as you know, you're a lawyer and anyone who tries cases, particularly criminal cases, one of the things you consider is what do you open the door to when you put the witness on the stand? And here, had we put him up,  and none of the financial crimes had been introduced in the evidence, we would have likely opened the door to introduction of the financial crimes. But that had already been done, and he was so beat up at that point, frankly, you know, we had to throw a Hail Mary by putting him on the stand to explain the lie, explain why he cheated, explain why he stole, and because of his drug addiction, and we had hoped that jurors had  experience, whether family members or relatives of, you know, how drug addicts lie, cheat and steal, and that they would have understanding of that. And, you know, obviously that did not work. Did he think he did a good job on the stand? Did he regret taking the stand? Did he insist on going on the stand? He wanted to testify the whole time and, and, and it was a consultation. I'll tell you, you know, we did not disagree with, with his,  analysis, which was this jury is going to want to hear from me, particularly because I'm a lawyer, I'm articulate and I'm accused of killing my wife and son. And he's not wrong about that. And but, you know, as as as a tactical matter, you have to weigh that against the jury's ability to not hold it against him if he doesn't testify. And in any event, like I said, we had all this other evidence we had to deal with.  that had come in under this pretense of motive, which it really wasn't. It was a character assault that worked for the state. The father-son relationship is an unusual one, a special one. But consider just for a second what happened in a South Carolina courtroom today.

They're not releasing any additional information at this time, Brian.  Few people fall from grace as hard as Alex Murdoch. The ultra wealthy scion of an old money family in South Carolina had cash and connections to burn. His father and his grandpappy, they were top prosecutors in that state for almost a century. And that's why Murdoch became a lawyer and joined the family law practice.  But it is awfully ironic that a family dynasty that locked up so many felons ended up with one of their own locked up for life. When Murdoch's 52-year-old wife Maggie and their younger son Paul were found shot to death at their home in June of 2021, cops were baffled and high society was rocked.  Murdoch denied any involvement, but a series of bizarre events soon showed that Alex Murdoch had secrets and secret crimes going back more than a decade. Soon he was charged with dozens of counts of financial fraud. Prosecutors said he stole about $8.5 million from clients and associates and businesses, and he was promptly disbarred.  And just days later, on July 14, 2022, after a year-long investigation, he put on a yellow jumpsuit. He was indicted in the grisly deaths of his wife and his second-born son. The trial was dubbed South Carolina's trial of the century, and the media attention was epic.  Prosecutors hammered his ever-changing testimony, but Murdoch blamed it on paranoia and pain pills. And when asked to describe the crime scene, he broke down on the stand.  Prosecutors were not moved by that because they had a smoking gun. A video from his dead son's phone showing him casually strolling with his family down by the dog kennels where they would be dead within minutes. And metadata from his wife's cell phone showed Maggie's phone was moving even after she died.  I spoke to a digital forensics expert about just how damning that evidence was. His name is Jake Green, and he's the technical lead in forensics at Invista. Here's our conversation. Okay, Jake, so I want to think of all the different reasons that could be innocuous and innocent as to why Maggie is likely dead and her phone has a life of its own. Tell me.  There's not really any. That phone is moving because somebody is physically moving it around. All the gyroscopes and pieces within this device that record it, those are moving because someone's actually holding that phone and moving around with it. So there's not really anything innocuous that we could say, oh, well, it might have just mistakenly recorded it. No, this is something that was actually recording at the time somebody was moving.  So the one thing, I mean, everybody wants to say, aha, this is a Perry Mason moment. It's impossible to tell whose hand it is in. It's impossible to tell who's flipping it around, wondering whether it'll show something in portrait or in landscape. What's the next best thing to try to figure that out? Really the activity in and around. So looking at the databases, and I saw a copy of a report that you guys used as an infographic. They used a piece of software that  automates the review of the database that all this is coming from. That piece of software does an excellent job, but at the same time a manual review of the actual data itself of that database is going to give us much more than what that piece of software can give us. So, there can be other things that can show us not only  was the phone in portrait versus landscape? And you showed off your kids, I'll show off my awesome wife. It'll show us when was the last time this phone was unlocked? Was it unlocked with a pin? Did somebody unlock it with their face? What was the brightness? What was the backlight? So my phone right now is off and it's on a black screen. If I pick it up, and it's called Raise to Awake, so if you  black screen, raise it, your screen comes back on, that setting is going to be within that database as well. So it may not be something that was pulled out by the automated software, but that database can definitely hold that piece of evidence. So in and around and what happened and estimating steps, could this person have taken that same number of steps to make it back to the house?  That movement had to have occurred somewhere. So trying to place other pieces of evidence, as well as the physical evidence of DNA and fingerprints on the device as well. And that's how you would put that phone in somebody's hand. So the 59 steps, like Maggie's phone walked 59 steps after she's dead, at 8.53, just minutes, minutes after she's dead.  and  be wrong. I always wonder if my step count is right. Like is the is the iPhone really picking up every step or could it be in a truck or could there be errors. How accurate is this. I'm trying to think of what would someone be doing around a dead body for 59 steps. It's not very far. Yeah. So the things that we've  that other folks have done is there can absolutely be flaws. It's not, there is no known accuracy for are those steps accurate within five, 10 steps. I would be more concerned with the estimated distance as that is something that is measured with GPS within the location data within that device. So I would trust the distance more than I would trust the actual, the step counts.  OK, well, that's interesting. But I do have this list I want to show you. I thought this was pretty damning, actually. It's Alex Murdoch's steps. And there are so many of them, and it seems really frantic. It starts at 6.42, and it goes right through almost every 10 minutes or so. 6.42, 6.52, 7.03, 7.15, 7.28, 7.55.  805, 902, and they're like giant steps at times, like 283 steps, 270 steps, again, 283 steps, 167 steps. They're all over the map from 642 to 805. But he also says he took a nap. And I don't know. That's kind of impossible, isn't it? I mean, that's not the kind of mistake where you could say, well, the iPhone's not always accurate. That doesn't show that he's napping.  Right, so keep in mind that the windows that we see within movements, those are typically the first indication of movement and the last indication of movement.  It's just that within that 10 minutes, it detected movement and estimates it. So you could have taken those steps in the first five minutes, the first four minutes, you could have run for the first minute. So that's just the way the phone records these items. So I think the other important thing to keep in mind is that investigators properly preserve this phone and we're able to pull out these databases.  because they were able to get them within 30 days. So this database rolls over, it's constantly. So the reason we ask about, well, what about Mr. Murdaugh's phone? What was his screen doing at the time? They may not have arrested him for 30 days or may not have seized his phone within 30 days. So that's why his data is different from what was found on the Weiss phone.  Alex Murdoch was found guilty after just three hours of deliberations and the very next day was hit with two consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": "Explains how trauma can affect emotional expression, suggesting why Buster Murdoch's testimony may appear unemotional.", "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The host introduces the topics of the Murdoch family saga, including Buster Murdoch's statement and the exhumation of Stephen Smith's body.", "SPEAKER_01": null, "SPEAKER_02": "Alex Murdoch's attorney, discusses Murdoch's desire to be in the general prison population, his state of mind, the trial outcomes, and challenges faced during the trial.", "SPEAKER_03": "Asks Buster Murdoch questions during his testimony about when he found out about his mother and brother's murders and his awareness of his father's opioid addiction.", "SPEAKER_04": "Discusses the Stephen Smith case, its connection to the Murdochs, Buster's statement denying involvement, and the legal and evidentiary aspects of both the Smith and Murdoch murder investigations.", "SPEAKER_04 (Trump)": null, "SPEAKER_05": null, "SPEAKER_06": null, "SPEAKER_07": null, "Sam Schweppe": null, "Scarlett Fu": null, "Secretary of State Marco Rubio": null, "Selena Zito": null, "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Senator Chuck Grassley": null, "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer": null, "Senator Patty Murray": null, "Senator Susan Collins": null, "Stephen A.

No, I think he's in good shape.  Now, the fact that people are upset at Pam Bondi over this, too, the White House is trying to respond in a way that says, no, all of these people are on the same page.

President Trump has assembled an incredible team of law and order patriots committed to making America safe again and restoring the integrity of our criminal justice system. Attorney General Bondi, FBI Director Patel, and FBI Deputy Director Bongino,  and the countless other heroes of our law enforcement community are dedicated to executing President Trump's agenda. Again, a lot of the ire is in the direction of Pam Bondi, the Attorney General, because, as we heard in the opening, Nick, she did promise to release all Epstein files. She was also in an interview  saying that the Epstein list, this client list allegedly, was on her desk for review. She later clarified she meant all of the files and not that specific document, which now the FBI and the DOJ say does not actually exist. It was that statement that really set off a lot of the furor around this, and it has persisted.

And then what will that do to our growth rate, our economic growth rate, and what will that do to economic growth in other countries? So, you know, the international trade has been a big trade this year. But if those countries start having slower corporate earnings growth because  demand for their goods and services goes down because of tariffs. And that's a question they're asking, too.

And they really won't accelerate until later in the year. So, I do think the Fed will end up staying on hold at the July meeting, and potentially for the following meeting as well, because I think it will be too soon to make a final determination about what's happening to inflation.  I think that corporate earnings are going to show up. Second quarter are probably likely to beat because you're looking at expectations of only two to three percent earnings growth in the second quarter. Very low. And the tariffs really haven't hit yet. So I think second quarter earnings, which, as you mentioned, are going to come out starting tomorrow, those are going to be OK.  I think third quarter is when we're going to hear much more hand-wringing from companies about how they're going to cope with the tariffs.

What runs through your mind as you watch the price action lately?  So I think crypto and Bitcoin are really a play on inflation and on the US dollar I think of them as a currency And so I think if you're concerned about inflation and the dollar then they can deserve a place in a portfolio But they're kind of like gold in the sense that they don't they don't pay a dividend or pay any cash flows So it becomes a hedge against that and I'm a DCF person always have been so that is a little bit. Oh, yeah  Exactly, exactly. So that makes it a little bit thorny. But I do think that we are seeing some uncertainty with the dollar and with the with treasuries.

The market's ignoring every risk. They're ignoring the risk with the Fed. I mean, you've got somebody in the White House who's a real estate investor. They live on debt.  So you've got that. You've got, normally, you'd see a major upheaval in the bond market, because rates would just go through the roof with instability there. If you listen to Kevin Haslett today, and I think he's a smart guy, he's got zero credibility for what he says, that tariffs aren't going to impact the buyer, meaning the consumer, or companies. I can tell you, in the supply chain, as we look at it in some of our companies,  Aluminum's up 50 percent. So, source from the U.S. The U.S., the companies here are not fools. They now see a pricing umbrella 50 percent above where they were. So, where are they? They raised their prices 35 percent. So, even if you don't pay the tariffs, you're going to pay it here. And, look, companies that have EBITDA margins, like grocery stores, like many others, the auto companies,  They're mid-single digits at best. They can't absorb the tariffs to operate a law. So we'll come through. So the question is, back to Trump. He said there are deals. There are no deals. There are letters that he's saying, this will be our deal. The deal takes two parties. So he's going to have to renegotiate. The question that you bring up,  At some point, he's not going to tackle it. At some point, he's got to say, we're doing this, not just with steel and aluminum, but more broadly, so every other country feels it. The critical countries are, of course, India and the EU and Japan. Once you get through those, then the others really don't matter. So I think you've got to see some deals or some maybe fake deals, like we did with the UK, where it really doesn't matter. In terms of the overall risk in the market, it's definitely the Fed.  You can't put a complete dove in there. It's definitely tariffs. It's also inflation that could come from the spending bill that was just passed. And then it's more cuts they're talking about. So I think that the market's going to continue to ignore these risks, as they have for the last year. And the market accepts, OK, in just the final word, earnings.

So a breather because we just don't know?  As that view became more mainstream, the market rallied back up. We had a bit of a pause in terms of the rhetoric. Scott Besson started speaking, was more prominent. And people like Peter Navarro, who the market was more skeptical of, took a step back. Now you're at the point where the president is talking again about higher tariff rates that's going to take the effect of the U.S. tariff rate up even higher than we currently anticipate it to be. So my argument would be, while we determine exactly what that level is going to be, after a truly historic rally off the lows,  Some breather is in order. And just to frame this for the viewers at home, top to bottom from the post-Liberation Day lows, the U.S. stock market was up 26% over whatever period of days that was. That's the type of rally that you see off the 2009 low, off the 1974 low, off long-term capital management low. 26% or so in that shorter duration of time is really, really rapid and really, really strong.

I'm not gloomy in the sense that I think we could do better, actually. Not that it's easy and there's a magic button the government could press that would make everything OK. But I think we could do things that would make growth better. We could manage the public finances in a way that started to get debt down. How would you do those things, then?  Well, I think on the growth one, which is really the thing that would move the dial, I think what's difficult is that there's no one policy. I think you have to do the hard yards across lots of policy areas. But just to take one example that I know well and take tax policy, what the government's really done is tied its hands and say, I don't want to do very much or we'll scrape by budget by budget.  But actually, it raises so much money in tax in ways that are often really pretty damaging to growth. I think we should be throwing the kitchen sink at this. And in all policy areas, including tax, finding ways to drive up growth. So there are taxes we have. I'll give you one example, stamp duty. I think every opportunity we should bash stamp duty is an awful tax. We could revalue council tax, raise more through council tax, and scrap stamp duty. That would be pro-growth.

One of them is that currently it's really unfair because it's based on property values from 1991. I mean, imagine if we did that with income. If we based your income tax bill on your income in 1991, we'd know that was absurd. But we're doing that for our housing tax. But it's also, it's regressive. So the more expensive the property you live in, the smaller the share of your tax. And I think it's hard to justify that element of it. What's your view on a wealth tax?  Well, I think people mean different things by a wealth tax. I think if you mean a tax on the annual stock of wealth, then I think it's not where I would go, basically. I think it's got problems in principle. It basically taxes wealth the longer you hold it. It discourages saving and investment.  And in practical terms, the government is not currently valuing all wealth. It would be a really big thing to get this off the ground and administer it. What I think we should do is look at the taxes we already have on wealth, so capital gains being a great example, and fix those. And again, that's a great example where we have lower rates of tax on capital gains. But at the same time, because of how we design the tax reliefs, we'd mostly discourage investment in risk taking. So again, we should look at reform. We should fix the tax base, not, for example, tax inflationary gains, but  but do tax gains in a more sensible way.

I think most businesses won't like the ongoing uncertainty of limping from budget to budget, knowing that something else is coming but not quite knowing what it is.

He did take pains to say on NX that he does not support a full-blown merger of Tesla and XAI, but he has signaled on there multiple times now that he would be in favor of Tesla putting money in.

You've got a good point, Paul. Private label has been consistently growing and got a huge bump since the pandemic. And part of that is that the retailers have really invested in the quality and the differentiation of those private label brands. So where consumers now really consider them not just a replacement for national brands, but in some instances, just regular brands of their own right.  And so, you know, Kraft Heinz actually had reduced some of its exposure to private label when they sold off the planters business, when they sold off the cheese, like the shredded cheese business with Kraft. But the core grocery business, they do still have a lot of exposure to private label. So is this a lot of competition from, let's say, startup food companies appealing to younger consumers? I mean, what kind of sparked this?  Well, there's really been a shift in the way consumers are looking at brands. And unless you own a long legacy brand that you can reinvent and really drive interest from younger generations, it's really hard to keep that going. And so what we've seen is that they've done a good job with revitalizing things like Philly cream cheese.  But despite a lot of investment, brands like Capri Sun, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House, these brands just aren't resonating with younger consumers. And that means that the growth prospects for those brands are a lot lower.

I mean, over time, Berkshire Hathaway has actually done quite well out of this deal, even though Kraft Heinz as an overall entity is probably disappointed in the overall analysis. But the merger was in 2015. It's been 10 years. The value of the deal at the time in 2015 was $45 billion. Today's market cap, it's $32 billion. And yes, they've sold off a couple of brands.  It just hasn't materialized to be the type of growth that I think Berkshire Hathaway initially envisioned it would happen. Jennifer, can you dig more into some of the advantages but also the risks associated with breaking up the company?  Obviously, some of the advantages, and this seems very similar to what Kellogg did when they spun Kellanova and WK Kellogg out into two separate companies. They separated the growth prospects and then those from the slow growth areas. That's very similar to what Kraft Heinz seems to be doing. Obviously, if you can focus on growth areas, that gives you undivided attention to really expand and grow.  That would be an advantage. I think one of the disadvantages, and this is something that's kind of a broader question to consider, is whether there's a cycle that's starting. Because we've seen companies like Kelinova split. We see Unilever spinning off their ice cream business. And those new entities are now being bought up by others. So you've got Mars acquiring Kelinova. You have Ferrero acquiring WK Kellogg.  But in order to get regulatory approval, you have to have categories that aren't overlapping. And so you're seeing a new birth of new kind of conglomerates of dissimilar portfolios. And so it makes me wonder if we're setting up another cycle where in another five years, 10 years, we're going to see these companies that have been buying up the underperforming brands going through a similar type of activity."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 731.292, "text": " What's driving all this?

What is interesting is that my colleague Aud Gerspacher just finished a deep patent analysis for  That's right. Exactly, Paul. For Wigovi, the dates in terms of patent experience, of course, they're important because that's when generics can come in and compete with you.

And when we look back a couple of years here, how do we rationalize the fact that we've been having this conversation about our defense industrial base for decades, and we really don't have a greater capacity to show for it?

We were running at about 25% of the proper level of munitions order. In other words, when we needed four, we ordered one.  When you do that over 20 years, you really create a deficit. And worse, you tell the defense industrial based companies, I'm not going to do major orders. And they reduce their ability to produce. So what you've seen over the last three years are pretty consistent from the supplemental, the Ukraine supplemental, Taiwan supplemental,  a couple of years ago, this year's budget and next year's budget, actual investments in the defense industrial base, where the United States is contributing to defense industrial base companies like Lockheed and Raytheon and Northrop Grumman to expand their ability, their capacity to produce, they obviously contribute.

Ukraine is fighting four countries, Russia, North Korea, Iran and China. And in fact, Russia today is firing more artillery from North Korea than their own. In other words, the majority of the artillery being used by Russia is North Korean. North Korea gave about six million rounds, which is 20 years of U.S. production to the Russians. Iran has built a Shaheed drone factory in  Russia, after giving them thousands of their own Shaheed drones or selling them, they now have a factory there producing it. That's what's hammering the Ukrainian cities every night. And the third thing is China has been backstopping the economy with increases in imports and exports, but equally importantly, providing the microelectronics that are used in Russian cruise and ballistic missiles. So all three of these countries, this axis of authoritarians, are supporting the fourth  Russia in this fight. And that's who Ukraine's been going against.

They're losing incrementally a kilometer here, a kilometer there of land, but they have the societal resilience  to stay in this fight and win.

And there are some reports that the U.S. is really low in stockpiles, perhaps down well below 50 percent. And this is a big problem, and it's a big problem for our defense industrial sector that really can't produce enough. And there's just been big orders by the U.S. Army  to try to ramp up production of these missile interceptors used by the Patriot system. So this is a problem.

Secondary sanctions, something else we talk about a lot, but we never quite get to.

We are trying to develop close ties with India. We see India as a strong potential partner vis-a-vis China. And we've also been reticent in some ways to go after a number of Chinese banks and other Chinese entities. So I think, you know, with this tariff play, we'll see.  It could have real ramifications, I think, for Russia's oil sector, but it would also have real implications for the United States bilateral relations. And the thing we have to remember is part of what the Biden administration was trying to do was to keep Russian oil on the global market.  We wanted Russia to take a haircut in terms of how much profit it was getting in terms of sales, but we didn't really have a problem with Russia selling oil. We just wanted it to sell it at a haircut because we wanted Russian oil on the market to keep global prices low.

So, you know, China does recognize that its oil dependence, its dependence on Russia as well as the Middle East, represents a real strategic vulnerability. It's part of the reason why they are going  a whole hog into renewables and clean technology. But for China, I think this could be really significant if the U.S. does impose this.

And the Saudis, I don't think were willing to. But with Trump, maybe it's different. I think the bigger, broader question here, though,  is that Trump has not shown a lot of interest in trying to really stick it to the Russians, economically or militarily. He has not demonstrated in the past a lot of support for Ukraine. If that is shifting, the question is how far does that shift? I think what we've seen is a partial shift.  The U.S. now looks like it's going to continue military supplies, but there's no indication Trump is going to go to Congress, try to ramp up our production for Ukraine. And then the economic question is, how much of an economic hit is the president willing to absorb to stick it to the Russians in support of Ukraine? There's limits to what the Biden administration would do.  So I do have some doubts about how far we are willing to go. And I think Russia may just try to call our bluff here. And it'll be really interesting when the 50 or 60 days expire, whether that prompts sort of a strong US reaction. But there could be a good outcome if we just simply get India to lower the amount it's buying. And maybe there's some way to negotiate something with the Indians to reduce the amount of Russian oil and other Russian military goods and things that it's purchasing."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 434.258, "text": " That'd be very Trumpy, wouldn't it?

Today's a fun and exciting day, and this is a celebration.  full production this year, so cells are already coming off the line."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 119.719, "text": "Yes."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 120.06, "text": "Could you just explain the roadmap for the ramp because no facility is straightforward, but this is the size of 200 American football fields. How are you going to get to full capacity this year? So we started in November 2022, two and a half years ago, and it was all flat field and it was a massive land and we started the construction and we started the production.  and testing last week and we're going to produce the batteries this year and you probably saw the cars that we have in display and Tesla Lucid and Hexagon truck and we're really excited to work with different suppliers and partners and clients this year.  We're going to discuss in detail those customers. They're really key to this. There were media reports Friday night that there would be a delay in reaching full capacity. And what the report stated was that was due to demand. Are you able to comment on that report? And it sounds like they were misinformed if you are going to hit full capacity this year.  I do think it was misinformed, and we're a Japanese company, and when we say, when we commit to something, we're fully committed, and we want to make sure that we support all the customers that were committed. We're not feeling the slowdown yet, and we're very bullish on working with all those customers.  When you say you're not feeling the slowdown, that means that you're seeing consistent orders from those key customers or they're still committing to orders in advance. What do you mean by the definition of what you just said? So we have the operation in Reno and that's going very healthy and we're seeing the commitments coming in for this facility as well. So we're not feeling the  slow down yet. But yet again, I mean, you see this operation, this is a long-term commitment. So there may be some pushback or moving ahead, but we're committed for a long term and we're not shying away from those from time to time challenges.  Throughout the morning there was a lot of discussion about Tesla because Tesla makes the best-selling EV model in the world. This specific facility, does Tesla dominate the proportion of output or is it more evenly split across your different customers? So we're working with Tesla for sure and we're working with Lucid and Hexagon and other clients. So it is to diversify our EV manufacturing in the United States.  What do you mean by diversify, move away from one sort of core customer? No, not really. We're expanding, right? So we're definitely working with Tesla, but we want to work with other established OEMs as well as startups. So it's part of our efforts to expand our strategy and manufacturing output as well. What signals has Tesla given you about its future orders, about the health of its business?  Your guess is as good as mine. But we have a long-term relationship, longer than anyone else. And they're still a very important strategic partner for us. And I believe our partnership is very strong.  Throughout the morning, there was a lot of discussion of how Kansas was the absolute best candidate. What were the biggest factors in choosing this site? Were they financial? Were they simply the ability to get things done? Lack of red tape? Why were you able to move so quickly?  So we talked about the available workforce and the infrastructure. I mean, you saw the power lines built by the factory and as well as the energy procurement that we can do. But more than anything, there was something very special about Kansas.  All the officials were able to work with us, and you probably heard that Lieutenant Governor Toland making some of his speech in not only Japanese, but in Osaka dialect. And that level of insight and care and support really made a difference. And it doesn't matter what party they are, they're very committed to bring us here, but also make us feel home.  So that kind of partnership, not just numbers and infrastructure, but emotional partnership made the difference. And we're so happy to celebrate today. What I was going to say on the numbers is there is a job creation story. So 4,000 direct jobs. I think the number is 20,000 indirect jobs when you take into account supply chain, construction.  What have you had to do to kind of bring the other infrastructure you've needed to DeSoto, have everything you need around you? So what was great about planning it out, like I said, we started two and a half years ago, and at that time we worked with local schools and community colleges to create curriculums.  So when we start for manufacturing, they are there ready, already taking the courses and be available to take a job here. To guarantee you have the skill sets that you needed? Absolutely, absolutely. So we created curriculum together and it's been a really good partnership and it helps us and it helps the community and it's like wonderful win-win.  The headline figure was that Panasonic put $4 billion into this DeSoto facility, but you were also, the reported number is eligible for almost $7 billion from the inflation reduction act. How much of that materialized?  We haven't started the manufacturing here, so we have not seen the incentives yet. They're set against milestones. Yes, yes. So it comes with the production, so we're looking forward to it, and it's definitely a big part of our investment. Do you anticipate that you will get access to the full tranche of money?  We certainly hope so. Things have changed. I mean, things have changed even since you and I spoke in January. There is some effort underway to reshape or undo the Inflation Reduction Act. It seems like the $7,500 credit which goes to the consumer of the vehicle will go, but the 45x manufacturer credit seems intact. How have you navigated that? Is that your read on the scenario as well?  So we're still very hopeful that it should remain, and I think it should remain. It's not only for us, but it's for creating jobs and manufacturing and bringing technology to the U.S. So, so far it's very positive, and we're hopeful that it stays. It will be a big part of our long-term strategy.  What's the supply chain story right now for DeSoto, Kansas? When you think about your raw material needs and everything that goes into the sale process, are there things that are still difficult? What are they? Or has bringing this facility online been smoother because of policy?  We have been planning for the supply chain resilience not just for this and recent tariff situation but from COVID. During COVID we really suffered from weak supply chain. I mean I think all the industry did and so did we. So we've been planning for supply chain resilience.  And we are, I mean just for our benefit too, to make sure that those supply chains stay local and within the North America. And our goal is to complete 50% of our supply chain by 2030 to be completely local.  Are any of the conditions currently associated with that 45x manufacturer credit difficult when you think about foreign entity of concern or parts of the supply chain, which in the context of metals, China is still a factor here? Yes.  So, we started partnering with China for the supply chain resilience. We are trying to diversify and make sure the supply chain is more resilient to make sure that we can procure and process on site. So, it's not really a new change for us necessarily. We've been trying to do that for a few years. Where are the bottlenecks right now, if any?  I don't know. It's really the refining process to make sure that we can find a supplier who can make sure that the quality is there, right? The refinement, the quality matters for our quality production. So that's where we pay most attention to make sure that the raw material is ready for quality EV batteries, right? It's good for everyone. For consumers, we want to make sure those EV batteries are tested and safe.  I know this might seem far-fetched, we are just bringing this facility online, but one of the questions I got from you from the audience is what happens next? You have Nevada, you now have Kansas. Does Panasonic see further sites? For EV in the first instance, what is your next priority?  It's TBD. Today's the first day of this operation, and we're really excited to make sure that this goes smooth, producing quality EV batteries. We'll focus on that first, and if it goes well, who knows, right?  Demand is still a question. What I find interesting is a lot of the customer base is pure plate EV, but the lesson we've learned in the last 18 months or so is hybrid is still a big part of the market. Maybe in a way that surprised many. Do you have the ability to tap into demand for hybrid from this facility or others?  We don't know yet, but we're pleasantly surprised that EV sales still rose by like 11.4%. So that's a good sign. And like I said, this is a long-term play. So we're not going to be happy and sad with the small ups and downs. We're still bullish that EV markets should grow and hybrid transition should be part of it.  Have you done a sort of side-by-side analysis of the economics of a single cell? Bring mine back out. I have one single 2170 cell here. So this will be manufactured in Kansas, not subject to tariffs. You have the Nevada facility, but Panasonic Energy also has facilities all around the world. Is it just an instant fix that the cell on a unit basis  It's just a more attractive economic proposition if it's built here in Kansas for the American market versus shipping sales in from your overseas facilities. It makes a lot more economic sense to produce here, right? Bring raw materials here and produce here.  And we're cutting in for some breaking news here. We have President Trump in the White House with the NATO secretary-general. Take a listen. That was President Trump with the NATO secretary-general announcing that he was, quote, unhappy with Russia and is threatening secondary tariffs of 100 percent on Russia if a deal with Ukraine is not reached.  But first, let's get to some breaking news that crossed the wire. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, took to threads to say that the company will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in computing to build superintelligence. Shares rose off the news, and let's get right to that with our very own Kurt Wagner.

He's even admitted  Some companies, presumably his own, will overpay on AI in order not to fall behind. So hundreds of billions on infrastructure. But I think, Jackie, when you look at this, why it makes sense is you recall over these last couple of weeks, they've been spending very aggressively to hire AI talent for this superintelligence group. And I think this commitment to the infrastructure side is meant to sort of go hand in hand with that. OK, so we've hired the talent. We have the people in the building that we think can build this thing.  And now we're putting the money behind the infrastructure to help support them."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 859.4, "text": "Kurt, this announcement has fresh resonance, especially as some of Meta's competitors are making their own moves to really bolster their AI ambitions.

We've talked about this historically on this show before, this idea that all of Elon Musk's various businesses sort of work together and help one another. And I think that's just become more and more prevalent.  especially as XAI has grown. And so we learned that SpaceX, for example, is now investing $2 billion into XAI. We've seen that Elon Musk plans to put a shareholder vote to Tesla shareholders asking if Tesla should invest in XAI. We obviously know XAI and Twitter already merged or X already merged. So this notion that all of these different sort of  businesses of Elon's are now contributing to the AI business, I think is super notable. And you can see there are some, you know, to use the terrible cliche, synergies between these companies, right? The idea that Grok might be distributed through Teslas is one example of that. But it does feel like Elon is saying, okay, I have these other businesses that are doing well financially.

And so I think if you're Elon, you just say, look, you're putting in money now into a technology that's going to be worth 10, 100 times more down the line, but also you're going to get all of this data, this infrastructure that I'm building at XAI, and it could  could potentially benefit Tesla as well, again, as you improve self-driving, as you take Grok, for example, put it into the cars. So if I'm him, I paint this as very much like a rosy marriage between the future technology and putting all of that into an automobile, which I think they're already doing.

Thanks for joining us. Coming up, Lucid Interim CEO Mark Winterhoff joins us from the Panasonic EV battery plant in Kansas. More next. This is Bloomberg Tech.  Welcome back to Bloomberg Tech. We're live in DeSoto, Kansas, at Panasonic's brand new EV battery plant, 4.7 million square feet, at full capacity, which will happen later this year. Some news we broke with Panasonic's North America CEO, Megan Myung-Won Lee, 30 gigawatt hours of capacity. That's enough cells for 500,000 EVs per annum. One of the key customers, Lucid, and Lucid CEO Mark Winterhoff, interim CEO Mark Winterhoff, is with us now.  This is a significant moment for you as well, because it's your first domestic supply of cells. Reflect on that. That is true. Currently, we're getting our battery supplies either from Japan or from Korea, depending on the supplier. And Panasonic is a great partner for us. We decided two and a half years ago to make together this investment here and to localize the production, the cell production here to Canada.  It's not just volume supply. This is 2170, but my understanding is there was some co-engineering to make this as good as it can possibly be. Explain how that works. It's a great collaboration between our engineering departments and their engineering department. We bring in a lot of experience on what the cell is supposed to do in real life, and they make it happen with chemistry and with all of the parameters of the cell.  So it was really, really great collaboration. And that we also then are able now to produce this here locally, obviously in the current climate, helps us a lot.  How did the economics of the De Soto Candace May 2170 stack? I know that you love charts and spreadsheets as much as I do, but you must have done that analysis. Oh yeah, absolutely. What's it like? I would say we wouldn't have done it if it wouldn't be economically feasible or beneficial.  As I mentioned before, we made that decision not just recently. So tariffs were not on the radar screen at that time. We did that decision two and a half years ago. And at that time, together with the 45x incentive tax credit, the economics make sense. I still have to say, and I hope that Panasonic hears that, that there's some room of improvement. But also right now, obviously with the tariffs, this is a very good move for us.  because the same cell that would otherwise have come from Japan or Korea is subject to tariffs. It is. That's a part of the equation. That is correct. And the other thing that we are currently working on together with Panasonic is obviously further localizing the supply chain for the cell, because it doesn't do you a lot of good if you manufacture here, but you still import the raw material, which is then subject to tariffs.  So, we're already doing a lot of investments in that. You heard about our Graphite One investments on the graphite and other materials. So, we're working with them on making that happen as well. Mark, I've covered Lucid for a number of years. This is the first time you and I have spoken and I'm grateful for your time. Your predecessor, Peter Robinson, had a very simple argument. Lucid had the best technology on the hardware side and software battery management system.  And even though your journey started in the premium segments, that you would scale to volume because you would just say, this performance and range in this pack, we can just scale it down, make a more affordable version. Have we hit that inflection point yet?  Well, I mean, we're about to. You know, everybody knows by now that follows Lucid that, you know, we are very, very strongly working on our midsize platform. Right. Which is a, you know, smaller platform also from a price point perspective, more in the round in the $50,000 range and not where we are right now.  And that's when we really hit that inflection point. But with the gravity that we are ramping up right now, we are already expecting to have much higher numbers than we had in the past. Right. I think, you know, there's a lot of work to do in the second half of the year to reach 20,000.  What role does the DeSoto plant play? Will you be able to get hold of sales from here for vehicles sold or delivered in this calendar year? No, not yet. That is something for next year and again with our partners with Panasonic we are working on opportunities to further bring this in because obviously in the current climate that is very important for us to localize.  We've focused this morning a lot on policy. You brought up the 45x credit, but the consumer credit of $7,500, likely no more. What can you do in that environment with the vehicle? Are you able to pull forward lower price point variants? Are you looking to just appeal to the premium segment on an ongoing basis?  Well, first of all, when it comes to our current vehicles with the AIR, it might not be widely known, but we are the best-selling vehicle in our segment, the best-selling EV. And we also were in the second half of last year. Actually, no, in the beginning of this year, we were the best-selling vehicle in the whole segment, including ICE vehicles. So the AIR is actually doing well, although the numbers are obviously, when you look at the broader scheme of things, are not that high yet. But that's because of the size of the segment. Right.  With gravity, obviously we're now reaching a different scale, and we're still ramping up the production, and as you said, we have to do quite a lot in order to get to our target for this year, but it's going well. We're unclocking some of the blockages that we had in the supply chain, and our plant really got into the groove to create the vehicle.  So I would say the inflection point of having really economics of scale is still a little bit out. We're still more appealing to the higher price segment, that's what we have. And I mean, in automotive, you cannot just decide, oh, let's put out a new, cheaper variant next week. It takes years to implement, to plan, to engineer, to validate. So that's sometimes not well understood.  Manufacturing and building great cars is a long-term game. And you have to build also economics of scale over time. It's not something that happens from one day to the other. But I'll hold you to it. 20,000 is realistic this year with the time left to you. We're in a quiet period right now, so I cannot really talk about it. I suggest you tune in in our earnings call on August 5th. I will do. And you will definitely hear about it.  and the mid-sized platform is on track for next year. And the same applies to that as well. We're working very hard but on August 5th there will be news on that. The other part of Lucid's history was the idea of partnerships, manufacturing partnerships, licensing technology. Has that idea changed given the political environment?  No, actually, no, it hasn't. So as a matter of fact, and I said that in the last couple of months, and everybody honestly, understandably asked me, okay, where is it? Where is it? Again, those things take time. And particularly in the last couple of months with the uncertainty of the terrorists, I have to say,  Many of the people we had conversations with, they have other issues. They have pressing things to solve right now in the last quarter. We also on top of that had the magnet shortage, which actually halted production for several players. So those discussions still happen on our EV core technology. But also beyond that, stay tuned, there will be other news also coming.  Are those potential partners motivated by the environment, the effort to onshore industry in this country to work with American companies? There are different things. First of all, right now with the perceived slowdown of EV adoption,  especially companies that have both ICE vehicles and EVs, they can only invest the dollar once. So, right now we see, let's say, shift back to ICE vehicles, and therefore, but they still need to come out with new models, and therefore we have increased interest in, hey, can we do things together? And I expect this to continue, actually.  You talked a moment ago about being dominant in your segment, the lead seller in that segment. But everyone always asks me, if somebody is put off buying a Tesla vehicle, I drive a Tesla vehicle, a Model Y, but there are many out there that say, I don't want to buy a Tesla vehicle. Have you any data that says those buyers turn to Lucid in the pure play categories that you operate in?  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, as I just said, we're now the best selling vehicle in the United States in our segment. That includes the Model S, our segment. I mean, I don't compare right now the gravity because we're still ramping up. We're in the phase of ramping up. I guess let's talk again by the end of this year where we stand on the gravity. But the air, yes, we see a lot of incoming. We always actually, by the way, had a lot of interest from Tesla buyers. That's not really new.  But it has increased. Absolutely. This administration is fascinating in Lucid's context. Maybe the pro-EV policy is not there, but supporting U.S. manufacturers is. You also have the relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the administration in the context of GPUs, for example, has been supportive in those trade deals. What has the experience been like leading this company under the Trump administration? And net-net, how do you think you've come out so far?  Well, I mean, obviously things became more complicated. I mean, the tariff situation, I mean, there's no doubt it increases our cost. And it also creates a lot of additional headache, because you now have to completely rethink the supply chain. Are you continuing certain things, or are you localizing? Again, that's nothing that happens from one day to the other. We are doing okay.  when you compare to other players in the industry, also from the cost increases, particularly because we build everything right now in the United States. We build all of the vehicles, our key components, they're all built here in the United States. Having said that,  We are hit by obviously raw materials or let's say tier two suppliers that we have to import and we have to pay tariffs on that. So it's not that we are not impacted but we are less so than others. So yeah I mean it's something we have to work with.  And for us, it's also because we are a pure EV manufacturer. We believe in the future of electrical propulsion. We're not wavering. We're not saying, oh, let's do, I don't know, a range extender or something. That's not going to happen with Lucid. This is part of our vision, you know, that this is the future and actually important to save our planet. So we will find a way through this, but also I have to say,  For the American consumers, vehicles are going to be more expensive under the tariff regime. There's no other way around it. Yes, you can say, oh, you just need to localize. Well, yes, but that still increases the costs, because there's a reason why the supply chain is so global, because certain things are either not available here in the US or are just very expensive, so you import them. And if you change that, you still have higher costs here in the United States, which means  Manufacturers like us, or actually any manufacturer, has to increase prices. There's no other way, unless you want everybody to be non-profit organizations, which then would lead to no innovation, no technology leadership, and I think that's, in the current climate globally, it's the last thing we want.  The cost of doing business in America. Mark Winterhoff, Lucid's interim CEO, one of the core customers at this Panasonic DeSoto Kansas plant that is due to hit full capacity this year.

The Trump administration has already dropped a lot of lawsuits that the Biden administration had brought against crypto companies, sort of letting it be trading free for all.

We had 52 tankers, tankers, the gasoline tankers, and they rode along with them at different aspects and they refueled and not a not a screw was broken, not a net  Not a mark was on those planes. Every engine was perfect. When they landed, they were just as good as when they took off. Think of that, 37 hours and about 40 minutes through a very rough territory. And those machines worked incredibly well and literally not a problem. And when I honored the flyers, we did it last week, I also honored the mechanics, the people that took care of those machines.  And I said, it's equally important. And you compare that same country, you compare that with what happened with Jimmy Carter was a sad situation. The helicopters were coming down and they were crashing and they were the men were all over the place trying to get the hell out of there. And it turned out to be a hostage situation and horrible thing. And probably it was one of the things that cost him the election, certainly.  When you think of that and you see this was, in terms of perfection, they think it was a perfect military. We sent the planes to Guam. Everybody thought we were flying to Guam. And they said, oh, they're going to Guam. Well, Guam's out of the way. At the same time, we had some others going a different direction. I watched  Horrible, horrible CNN. You know, you have to watch sometimes your opposition, and they are opposition. And I saw that they had basically the plans of when we're going in, when we would be entering Iranian oil airspace. And I said, you know, that's weird. And I called the general, Raisin Cain. He's fantastic. I said, General, and Pete Hexeth. I said, I'm watching newscasts where they're saying what time you're taking off tomorrow and what time we're going to be  entering the very dangerous airspace, the worst air space anywhere there is, anywhere in the world. I said, what do you think? Sir, we'll be fine. We blow them away, we'll be fine. Because, you know, they went, those B-2s with seven, and they were surrounded by a lot of great planes. F-22s, the most beautiful plane ever built. The fighter jet, F-35s, had a lot of different planes going with them.  I said, But wouldn't a surprise be better? Yeah, it would be better. I said, Well, then let me cancel it and let's make it at a different time. So the day before, you know, I canceled it. I canceled it. They said, I'm canceling it. We'll do it sometime within the next two, maybe three weeks. But I'm canceling it. And then  I had a meeting, and I said, I have an idea, because I got slightly big coverage, to put it mildly. So everyone knew it was being canceled. I said, let's leave at the exact same time we were supposed to leave the following day. And we took off, and that's when the planes went out to Guam and this and that. And we took off. And that was the only time \u2014 and they said it \u2014 that was the only time they knew we wouldn't be coming in, was the exact same time that I came. I said, let's do something. And they flew in, and they were stealth.  incredible planes. There was stealth and they hit every bomb hit their mark. Every single bomb hit the mark. It was unbelievable how they did it.

And it's not good news. See, it turns out that when Donald Trump said he was going to fight for working-class Americans, what he really meant  was he was going to take away your health care to cut taxes for the rich. That's what he really meant. Now, you may remember we were told that this was a different Republican Party. We were told Donald Trump's new GOP cared about working people. But Savannah,  Savannah, you can't claim to be for working men and women when you defund their hospitals and nursing homes. You can't claim to be for working men and women when you defund school lunch programs to help feed little boys and little girls whose hard-working parents are struggling to fill the fridge.  You definitely can't claim to be for working men and women when you do these things so you can cut taxes for the richest people in the country. Now there was a Republican senator with the integrity to oppose this. Tom Tillis of North Carolina. Did y'all see that? He was on the Senate floor. He was pleading with Republicans to do the right thing.  Senator Tillis warned that 663,000 North Carolinians will be pushed off Medicaid. He warned that President Trump was breaking his promises. He took a stand and he voted against the bill and they ran him right out of the Republican Party for it. Now it took courage what Senator Tillis did.  But among the Republicans who represent Georgia in Congress, no such courage was to be found. Just, yes, sir, no, sir, Mr. Trump. Now, let me tell you. Let me just tell you what it was like in Washington these last six months.  See, we had the leaders of Georgia's clinics and hospitals and nursing homes, caregivers for seniors and the disabled, nurses and doctors, teachers and school principals, the folks who run food pantries, they all came up to Washington and they begged Georgia's representatives in Congress. They said, please don't do this. They said it's gonna be devastating for healthcare and kids and seniors. And I want you to know, but Senator Warnock and I, we listened.  We listened. And we fought that bill with everything we have, and we voted no. We put Georgia first, Savannah. But every single Republican member of Congress who is supposed to represent Georgia, who is supposed to put loyalty to Georgia as their highest priority,  Instead, they chose loyalty to Donald Trump. Think about this. They're destroying the Medicaid program when 40% of all kids in Georgia are covered by Medicaid. 50% of all births, 50% of all births in Georgia are covered by Medicaid. 70% of all seniors in nursing homes in Georgia are covered by Medicaid.  There are now 37 Georgia nursing homes at risk of closure because of this law, and seven of them are less than two hours from where we are right now. Do you all remember what Donald Trump said about Medicaid? He said, we're not going to touch it. We're not going to touch it. Direct quote. It's like Senator Tillis said, a broken promise, and one of many.  President Trump promised to end the wars. He promised to release the Epstein files. Did anyone really think the sexual predator president who used to party with Jeffrey Epstein was going to release the Epstein files?

We've got some very, very, very special guests with us today. Really exciting announcement. So glad to have so many wonderful people. And how about all of this ice cream here in Washington, D.C. ?  First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you for being here today. It's obviously a bit of a toasty, humid day here in Washington, which is normal for July. But for you guys who are all out braving the weather to celebrate today, we're just so grateful. A very special thank you to our Agricultural Marketing Service dairy team. Where's our USDA team?  Oh, look at those wonderful people over there. Thank you, guys. It's kind of like y'all's Super Bowl. Yes, and you guys have won it. I love it. I'm also so excited to be joined by my dear, dear friend and partner. How about Secretary Bobby Kennedy of HHS? We also have the extraordinary FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty McCary.  Day, Marty. And then we have some incredible people you'll get to hear from, from the actual dairy industry. First, the president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association, Michael Dykes. Next, the president of Turkey Hill Dairy, Andy Jacobs. And finally, an Indiana dairy farmer, Sam Schweppe. So we'll get to hear very briefly from all of these incredible dairy industry and farmers behind me. Please help me welcome them as well.  I really want to say first and foremost how grateful we are at the Department of Agriculture to have the opportunity to partner with Secretary Kennedy and his wonderful team to represent the American agricultural community and to work together to improve the health outcomes of our kids and our families.  We know that our current health outcomes, especially for our children, are unsustainable and that American agriculture is at the heart of the solution to make America healthy again. I don't want to get too far ahead of the big announcement today, but I just want to commend the leadership, Michael and the whole team and everyone you represent at IDFA and all the dairy farmers and ice cream producers they represent  for taking on this voluntary, proactive effort to eliminate the use of artificial colors in ice cream products by the end of 2027.  Because of this historic partnership between USDA and HHS, and I will say it is an unprecedented partnership, but also because of leadership of organizations like IDFA and again all the farmers and producers they represent, we are driving meaningful change to make America healthy again.  I also want to acknowledge a lot of other partners, the Consumer Brands Association, Tyson Foods, PepsiCo, J.M. Smucker, Nestle, Hershey, ConAgra Brands, Kraft Heinz, and General Mills, each of which have recently made similar commitments to remove artificial colors from their products.  Just last week, the Consumer Brands Association announced a voluntary commitment to encourage the makers of America's food and beverage products to remove certified food, drug, and cosmetic colors from products served in our schools by the start of next year's school year, 2026.  The beauty of America is the role that private enterprise has always played, but will continue to play, and perhaps an even bigger role, in voluntarily shaping policies for the good of future generations. Dairy farmers represented by IDFA are certainly embracing that role, and we are  just so grateful. At this time, I'd love to welcome to the podium, again, my partner in this very valid, righteous, and incredible effort. Please help me welcome Secretary Bobby Kennedy."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 264.766, "text": " Thank you, Brooke. I'm particularly happy to be here today because this is relevant to my favorite food, which is ice cream.  I want to, you know, since we've, you know, since we came in about five and a half months ago and started talking about eliminating dyes and other bad chemicals from our food, we've had this extraordinary response from the industry. And Brooke just rattled off this inventory, this extraordinary inventory of national corporate food producers have all made commitments  to remove food dyes from their food. And with this addition today of the dairymen and the dairy food producers, we now have about 35% of American food industry that has made commitments. And that's an addition between 35 and 40%.  And that is in addition to the 35% of the food industry that was already organic and healthy and chemical free. Brooke and I have often talked about the fact that we can't make Maha succeed without the partnership of the American farmer. And our job is to help them to open the doors, to make sure that they have adequate  resources in their supply chains, and that the approvals for new chemical-free dyes are happening very quickly. And I'm going to bring on Marty McCary in a moment.  and he's gonna make an amazing announcement. Today, FDA has approved a new blue vegetable dye, in addition to many of the other dyes that we've, three dyes that we've already rapidly approved over the past two months. So we are gonna be there for the dairy industry. I grew up in a world where  milk was the healthiest thing that you could eat. There's been an attack on whole milk and cheese and yogurt over the past couple of decades, and Brooke and I, our agencies are about to release new dietary guidelines in the next several months that will elevate those products to where they ought to be in terms of contributing to the health of our children. There's a...  There's a tremendous amount of emerging science that talks about the need for more protein in our diet and more fats in our diet. And there's no industry that does that better than this industry.  I'm very grateful for this industry for stepping up, not only on this, but over the past 10 years, they've removed 60% of the sugar from milk products in school lunches. They've pledged to continue to reduce the amount of sugar in the food. This step is an extraordinary step, and I'm very proud to be part of this.  partnership. I'm very, very grateful to the industry. There are many dairy men and women in the audience, and we met with them this morning, and it was an amazing meeting with amazing people. And we want to make it so that they're successful and that they can do what they want to do, which is to provide our children with the healthiest food possible. Now I want to introduce my friend and my colleague, Marty McCary, and I've already ruined his announcement.  Now, thank you, Secretary Kennedy and Secretary Rawlings. We wouldn't be here were it not for both of your vision to make this happen, so thank you. And Secretary Rawlings, you've been the perfect partner in this.  We first said we want to remove all nine petroleum-based food dyes from the U.S. food supply and do it soon. The naysayers said it would not be possible. And here we are weeks later with an announcement that nearly 40 percent of food manufacturers have  raise their hand to say, yes, we agree. There are no Democrat or Republican children in America. They are children. And so we can do this because we now have enough reason to be concerned about these petroleum-based food dyes. We don't need to wait for a 10-year randomized controlled trial. Parents are telling us  that when a kid has abnormal behavior and they try reducing or eliminating petroleum-based food dyes, they have seen behavior improve. That is data. May not be a 10-year randomized controlled trial, but if we listen to parents, there are learnings there for the medical establishment. There are also randomized controlled trials also raising these health concerns with the petroleum-based food dyes.  Now, we believe in options, so that means we want natural dyes to be available to food makers and ice cream makers. Normally, every couple years the FDA will spit out one natural food dye approval. But on the charge of Secretary Kennedy, we have made this a priority, and Kyle Diamantis, who's standing here in charge of the food program at the FDA,  has made this a priority such that in the very short time we have been in office, we have now the fourth natural food dye from natural ingredients approved by the FDA. Today, I'm announcing that the FDA is approving Gardenia Blue as a natural food dye with natural ingredients.  We believe in options and we believe in incremental improvements in health. The sickness of American kids is not a willpower problem. It's not their fault. We can do things that will make the food supply healthier one step at a time.  So with that, I just want to reemphasize that this is a renaissance moment in health in America, and part of that is rewriting the broken food and nutrition guidelines of the United States. No longer are we going to have a broken food pyramid and a continuation of a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat that began with Dr. Ancel Keys.  We are going to have dietary guidelines that are based on science, not based on medical dogma. So with that, I want to say thank you and thanks for giving me a few minutes here."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 698.656, "text": " Thank you, Dr. McCary, another incredible warrior.

As a kid having grown up milking cows and as a dairy veterinarian, I've been there. I've seen it. I know your hard work and I know your dedication. So thank you for all you do. This is a unique opportunity for IDFA. We represent the industry, the processing industry.  And we're so happy with this voluntary, industry-led commitment to ensure that our products are on the right side of public policy and on consumer choice. Back in 2022, we made a similar commitment that we would maximize the amount of sugar in flavored milk in schools. And I'm pleased to say that in the last decade, we've reduced sugar 60% in American schools in flavored milk, which is the number one product for children.  Earlier this year, we made a commitment that we would eliminate the certified artificial colors. The company stepped forward that they would eliminate the certified artificial colors in dairy products sold in schools, milk, cheese, and yogurt. Another commitment that our industry stepped forward with a member companies coming for and making those commitments. And today, it's about celebrating ice cream and honoring the history of ice cream in America, but making sure that we continue to offer the products that consumers know and love.  This announcement today represents over 40 individual ice cream companies. It's the single largest effort of its kind, and it's efforts like this that demonstrate how our dairy industry is different. Our dairy industry was built on families.  Processing industries, processing organizations started off on a single farm with a creamery and years and years and generations later, they've grown into major companies. It is the dedication, it's the hard work, it's the commitment that  Our industry is committed to doing right and serving nutritious, healthy products to all. So, on behalf of all of them, I am grateful to be here today. I'm grateful to our IDFA members, all of our ice cream companies, all of the dairy farmers, and to Secretary Rawlings and Secretary Kennedy for being such staunch champions of dairy. Thank you.

I am Andy Jacobs, Chair of the IDFA Ice Cream Board and Chief Executive Officer of Turkey Hill Dairy, one of the nation's premier ice cream brands.  Today's announcement represents a commitment by dozens of individual ice cream companies from small independent companies to family owned companies going back generations to large multinationals. We have all come together as the ice cream industry to lead  major change and to make this commitment to remove artificial colors. And you may ask, why are we taking this action today? There are three good reasons. First, many of the commercial ice cream manufacturers have already phased out certified artificial colors, and many others are currently working with suppliers to phase them out as quickly as possible. Second, by taking this step now,  Ice cream manufacturers are ensuring that ice cream remains a special part of our lives as consumer preferences change and the nation's regulatory priorities evolve. As ice cream makers, we want to ensure families continue to enjoy their favorite wholesome ice cream treat. And third, this is about showing consumers and our communities that we are stepping up. We know that Americans eat roughly 19 pounds of ice cream a year.  Think about that. We also know that ice cream is important to our dairy farmers, our ice cream making communities, and our food retail partners. U.S. ice cream contributes almost $12 billion to the U.S. economy and supports over 27,000 dairy industry jobs. We want to ensure that we continue these bonds with our consumers and, more importantly, to grow our impact on the economy.  I will close by thanking the dozens of U.S. ice cream companies that have come together to lead this important industry initiative, and we will remove artificial colors from ice cream."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1114.441, "text": "Thank you very much."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1129.441, "text": " Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much to Secretary Rollins and Secretary Kennedy for the opportunity to speak today about my favorite dairy treat, ice cream, and about my family's dairy. I also want to thank the other dairy farmers who are here with me today. For families like ours, ice cream is much more than just a treat or a dessert. It's how we make our living and how we support our families and our communities.  My name is Sam Schweppe and my family owns and operates Schweppe Dairy, a fifth generation dairy in Huntingburg, Indiana, where our family has been nourishing our community since 1874.  We're part of the Prairie Farms Dairy Cooperative, where I serve on the board of directors alongside other farmer owners. With grown sons who do the daily operations on our farm, I also work off the farm for Fresh Connect Central, which is a social enterprise arm of Gleaners Food Bank in Indianapolis, and that is a member of the Feeding America Network.  I've lived on an operating dairy my entire life. And growing up, my parents were foster parents, and I personally observed the importance of good nutrition and the transformation it can make in a human being. I'll never forget one of my brothers arriving to our family at the age of nine with gray hair, bald patches on his head, and skin flaking off of his body due to a lack of nutrition.  After one month of regular meals, including the dense nutrition provided by whole milk and dairy products, and of course, our regular weekend ice cream parties, he transformed into a little freckle-faced, red-headed boy, and this memory is core to my mission to feed children.  As identified by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, milk contains many of the nutrients of public health concern, including calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, and, of course, protein. These nutrients are often under-consumed in the United States population, and they're linked to various health issues. It is essential we consume good, wholesome food products. That is what we're here to say today and to promise to America.  Products containing real dairy are the most nutritious options. And even though ice cream is decadent and has calories, it sure beats the heck out of candy and soda pop for a sweet treat. Because ice cream is also packed with nutrients, and it's made from real wholesome milk, and it delivers a powerful nutrient package.  So I'm just inviting everyone here, let's all join in the spirit and make sweet great again and enjoy some ice cream. I really appreciate you including the farmer's voice in today's events and we at Prairie Farms are pleased to join this commitment along with dozens of other ice cream makers and dairy farmers across the United States of America.

In Mexico, just as one example, there's over 3,000 and they have one third of our population.  There's about 3,000 in Canada, and they have one-eighth of our population. In Britain or in Europe, there are, I think, over 12,000 cases. And so we've done a very, very good job at controlling it. We have all the places where there's outbreaks, the outbreaks are actually declining.  We have CDC teams everywhere where governors have requested it. And we are also taking care of those populations that don't want to vaccinate. Most of the cases are unvaccinated Americans. There are some populations that do not want to vaccinate. We're making sure that there are protocols for treating people who actually get measles.  So in the individual states, if there are issues, we are there for them.

We have the highest healthcare cost of any country in the world, and we have the sickest population.  And one of the reasons for that is the food that we're eating. And we know that many diabetes cases can lose their more than half, can lose their diagnosis simply by changing their diet. And so this administration wants to encourage Americans to take control of their own health, to eat right,  to have lifestyle changes that save us all.

Medicaid is bankrupting almost every state. It's taking between 30, 40, 45, 50 percent of the state budgets and has for a really long time. For those of us who come from state policy, we know this very, very well. But one of the focuses of myself and Secretary Kennedy is changes to the SNAP program, which y'all have been great at covering.  But the fact that the number one purchase of taxpayer dollars in the SNAP program, which that, with a few other nutrition programs at USDA, spends $405 million a day, when the number one purchase item in there is sugary drinks and junk food, frankly, we have to make a change. So there is a lot of wholesale across the government that we can do, but there's also a recognition that a lot of these communities that are part of the Medicaid program, they don't always have access to healthy food.  So we have to do a better job through our nutrition programs, through our partnerships, et cetera, of ensuring that those communities have access to healthy foods that can make the choices that Dr. Oz, I believe, very articulately outlined.

The medical establishment locked arms and walked off a cliff together, insisting that the reason for heart disease in the United States was that people were not eating skim milk and no fat and low fat foods, ignoring the roles of refined carbohydrates and so many other things that drive general body inflammation, which is the precursor of fat deposition in the arteries.

This whole situation that America has found itself in over the last six-plus months has been one big corrupt, chaotic, and cruel project  that has been unleashed on the American people and it continues. I mean this Texas thing shouldn't surprise anyone because despite the claims by house Republican leaders that the American people have fallen in love with these extremists in the house of representatives and so they're acting upon a mandate. Give me a break. The only reason  The only reason that House Republicans even have a majority right now is because they stole three seats from the people of North Carolina. North Carolina is a 50-50 state. Donald Trump narrowly won the state in 2024. There's a Democratic governor, a Democratic lieutenant governor, a Democratic attorney general, Democratic elected officials across the state  of North Carolina who won on the same day. North Carolina is a 50-50 state. The North Carolina Congressional Delegation, which previously had fair congressional lines, produced a 50-50 congressional delegation. Seven Democrats, seven Republicans, as recently as January 2nd of this year. That was the makeup of the North Carolina Congressional Delegation. What happened?  Republicans engaged in mid-decade redistricting in a 50-50 state that had fair maps and produced an evenly divided delegation, and took it from 7-7, stole three seats that were in Democratic hands from the people of North Carolina as a result of illegitimate mid-decade congressional gerrymandering, and turned that delegation into 10 Republicans and four Democrats.  There's a three seat difference in the House of Representatives right now when Republicans are at full strength and Democrats are at full strength. 220 Republicans to 215 Democrats. That entire difference, the majority that Republicans have can be explained solely by the fact that they cheated in North Carolina. These people have zero credibility.  in terms of the issues that they're allegedly championing on behalf of the American people. If you believed in your ideas and the power of your issues, then why are you trying to cheat now in Texas, just like you did in North Carolina? The problem that Republicans confront is that the Texas congressional map is already gerrymandered.  And so this gerrymander may actually turn into a dummy-mander because they are going to create a situation where four, five, six, seven, eight Republicans who are currently in safe districts are going to be on the front line of our efforts to flip seats, particularly in a midterm election where Donald Trump is deeply unpopular and his signature one big ugly bill.  is deeply unpopular. Imagine a group of people, this is how corrupt they are, who in the middle of a search and rescue operation that is taking place in Texas right now, dozens of children drowned to death. Some of that has to do with incompetence in the Texas state government and incompetence in the Trump administration.  And instead of actually trying to be there for the people of Texas and the hill country, children at summer camp, who's lost their lives, they call a special session. And the main reason for that special session is to try to steal the midterm elections by rigging the Texas congressional map. These people are complete and total embarrassment.  The American people are not going to stand for it. And things aren't going to get better for them. Politically, they're only going to get worse.

As you enter into the building where I work with Bobby Kennedy and other leaders at the Health and Human Services, there's a quote on the side of the wall. It's from Hubert Humphrey, and it says, it is the moral obligation of government, and we honor this,  to take care of those at the dawn of their life, the children, those at the twilight of their life, the elderly, and those living in the shadows. Folks with handicaps, originally it was called blind, disabled. So those are the populations Medicaid was designed for. 60 years ago this month, by the way, it's having its birthday, and it's the backbone of the social support system, the safety net system of the country. We have to keep it viable.  And what happened over the last few years is a complete perversion of that mission, a destruction of its core purpose that led to its being at risk of bankruptcy. We would have spent $5.4 trillion more dollars instead of the $200 billion that we actually did put into it. So I'll say that again. We would have put a ton of money into it that would have bankrupted the system. Instead, we wisely put more money in, $200 billion.  But then, one step further, and under the President's guidance, we actually fixed the fraud, waste, and abuse. Specifically, work requirements, which is what they're talking about. When the program was created 60 years ago, it never daunted anyone that you would take able-bodied individuals who could work and put them on Medicaid. Today, the average able-bodied person on Medicaid doesn't work. They watch 6.1 hours of television or just hang out.  That's not fair. No, go out and try to get a job. They argue that we can't do it. They're arguing against the competency of the American people and their government. I would make the argument that if I offer you a deal, I'll give you free health insurance, but you got to get off your tail and go try to go to work. You'll take the deal.

I mean, the EU, US, they're not very far off in terms of what they need to agree to get some sort of deal done.

And if it did, you get a pretty big, significant tariff increase. But I would remind you, the E.U. is going to China at the end of this month. I'm sure the U.S. would like to have a deal in hand before then. So, there are reasons to do these deals. We're going to watch it play out over the next two weeks. And Trump just has to be careful. He burned his hand on the stove in April by trying to do $700 billion of tariffs.  We're starting to get closer to that range again. He does have some cushion and the market's giving him a leash because Treasury Secretary Besent's done well. But if they go too far, you'll start to see backlash in that.

And so Treasury has to figure out how it's going to finance the deficit overall.  And they're making a series of moves. So, number one, they've delayed how long it will take to refill the Treasury general account. Number two, they're going to change the supplemental leverage ratio rules. Number three is that they are going to do more buybacks and increase the amount of T-bill issuance and how crypto falls into that or how stablecoin falls into that.  Once you pass the stablecoin legislation, it creates this extra T-bill demand, and it could be as much as $800 billion. So Congress is passing a stablecoin bill this week. That should set the stage to kind of fill that liquidity. And if you're in a country and you're trying to get money out, then the Bitcoin is a way to get around it.

But then we added risk in April when the market was down double-digit. And now we're back up to levels where we wouldn't be consistent with a third year of a bull market.

It's unclear if he's including himself  in that, but certainly you can see some frustration creeping in there. So two things that stand out from what he was saying. The first one is that he's talking about penalizing Russia economically. It's unclear what he means by secondary tariffs. Does he mean direct tariffs on Russia?  The US and Russia don't do a lot of direct trade, so tariffs may not have a massive impact. Does he mean secondary sanctions on countries that are taking Russian products, particularly again, China and India, who import a lot of Russian energy? So is he threatening to put penalties on countries that are doing business with Russia, particularly around the energy space? He says he'll give Russia 50 days for a deal. It's unclear exactly what he means by a deal.  or he may impose some penalties. So there's a lot that's unclear from that, but certainly a sense that he's now dangling the idea of economic penalties on the government, the regime in Russia. And secondly, he's confirming that he will indeed provide Ukraine with what seems to be defensive weapons, primarily Patriot battery systems to allow Kiev to better defend  itself and those would be paid for though, they're not going to be given to Ukraine. Europe will be paying the US to provide those weapons and it will send them on into Ukraine.

But as you say, the key thing was he didn't really clarify if this would be just defensive weapons, again, that allow Ukraine to withstand Russian missiles and drone attacks, or whether it would be offensive weapons which would allow Ukraine to keep taking some of the fight into Russian territory directly. We know Ukraine's been firing drones at Russia and looking to attack Russia on its own territory, and it's running out of those kinds of weapons, long-range missiles and so on.

But equally, for now, he's been able to keep going. The question is for how long, given those cracks that we're starting to see in his economy. So further sanctions or tariffs, or whatever you want to call it, on Russian exports to the US, that's unlikely to have a major impact because there's not much that Russia is sending directly to the US.  The real impact would be to come at countries, again, China and India primarily, who are buying a lot of energy from Russia, and that's giving Russia access to hard currency to fund their war in Ukraine. And if you penalize China,  and India for buying oil, for example, from Russia, that could have an impact.

And I think Mark will tell you that it was really perhaps more important the date of November 5th. That was the election day. Maybe that was the most important because we've made tremendous progress together. And one of the reasons that you're here today is to hear that we are very unhappy, I am, with Russia.  But we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with them, and we're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. Tariffs at about 100 percent. They call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And, as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine.  And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it. And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there. So, based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. It's very simple. And they'll be at 100 percent. And that's the way it is. It can be more simple. It's just the way it is. I hope we don't have to do it.  But regardless, we are going to be \u2014 we make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's missiles \u2014 you saw that recently in Iran, the way those planes flew in. They had every single \u2014 14 bombs hit every target. Then you had the helicopters shoot a total of 30 bombs, 30 missiles. And they hit every single \u2014 Marco, is that right? \u2014 every single piece, every single target. And it was \u2014  I guess on a scale of zero to 10, they say it was about a 15. That's how successful it was. That's how lethal it was, a word they like to use nowadays. But it was an amazing, well-organized attack that people in this country wanted to do for 24 years. You know, when we had the pilots in last week, they were saying, sir, we've been practicing this for 24 years, meaning people, not them, but other people that are a little older now.  But they do. And you were the one that let us do it. But we've been practicing it three to four times a year for 22, 24 years, because they always knew they had to stop Iran from doing what they were doing, which is trying to come up with a nuclear weapon, a nuclear bomb. And we did it very successfully. And we make the best equipment, the best missiles, the best of everything.  The European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And they have \u2014 these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too. But we're in for a lot of money, and we just \u2014 we don't want to do anymore. And we can't.  But we make the best, and we're going to be sending the best to NATO, and in some cases to maybe, at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany, where they're going to send early-on missiles. And they'll be replaced, and NATO is going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here, who's a great ambassador. And Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So, in a nutshell, we're going to make top-of-the-line weapons, and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something, and it'll be mostly in the form of a replacement. And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy, for having had the career that he's had, because he had an amazing career  before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months. And if you could say a few words."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 287.637, "text": "Absolutely. No, no, Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big. This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want to bring what it needs to have to maintain  to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent, but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production.  So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have the Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more. So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need.  So if you can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hexhead at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days at this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them. So I really want to thank you for that. And it means the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries. We will deal with that. And exactly as you said, it might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here. So, really, thank you. This is important. Thank you."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "Apple"], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 414.699, "text": "The President You did a great job. That's a really great job. We've been very successful in settling wars. You have India, Pakistan.  You have Rwanda and the Congo. That was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled. And they did. And they were both great. Great leaders. And they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years. And at least 7 million people killed and killed with  A lot of pretty rough weapons, like machetes. Heads chopped off. Going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near. It's so frightening. And we got that one solved. Serbia, Kosovo. Got that solved. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I used. I used strafe for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars.  And that was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here on the Strip, the Gaza Strip. I call it the Gaza Strip. One of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace. It brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Witkoff is here, and I think we could have something fairly soon to talk about.  And we solved another one, one that we just seem to have, Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with an extra neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which  closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we're working on that one problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that. You've been hearing about that one. And that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam.  But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income in life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia. I'm not happy. And I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started.  If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye. But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they didn't have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. And I was outside looking in. And I said, you know, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started.  It's a real mess. We're losing \u2014 I guess they're losing 5,000 or 6,000 people a day. It's actually now more. I used to \u2014 I was saying 5,000 a day. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up, too. It's a horrible war. And it should be stopped. And so, if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing \u2014 secondary tariffs. And they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do, but I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk, and then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people. It's got to stop. It's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars' worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States, going to NATO, et cetera.  And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance. And they still would have had no chance if the equipment \u2014 they had the best equipment. Because we do make the best planes and missiles, and we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. And we have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about \u2014  the Golden Dome, it's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage, because somebody has to use that equipment. And they fought with tremendous courage, and they continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they don't have \u2014 they're losing on equipment.

So we will find a way through this, but also I have to say,  For the American consumers, vehicles are going to be more expensive under the tariff regime. There's no other way around it. Yes, you can say, oh, you just need to localize. Well, yes, but that still increases the costs, because there's a reason why the supply chain is so global, because certain things are either not available here in the US or are just very expensive, so you import them. And if you change that, you still have higher costs here in the United States, which means  Manufacturers like us or actually any manufacturer has to increase prices.

I mean, they are missiles, but they are intended to intercept incoming missiles. They're most effective against incoming missiles than any other kind of projectiles, but the reality is they can take out other projectiles as well. One thing that really stood out to me in the president's announcement right there was when he suggested  that one country alone may send as many as 17 batteries. That's not 17 individual interceptor missiles. That's batteries. A battery is made up of a radar, a control station, multiple launching stations. Each one of those can fire off multiple interceptors. So a battery in and of itself  A new one right now is upwards of about a billion dollars, Hallie. The interceptors themselves, they range in price depending, but they can be well over a million dollars as well. I mean, frankly, even as much as six million, depending on the variant. But no matter what, this is an expensive system.  Only a handful of countries in the entire world operate a battery. And I think there's only two or three. I was trying to do the research as the president was talking there, that have as many as 17. The United States is one. Japan has only a few more than that. So one country sending 17 batteries is an enormous  investment by that country. Now, one thing that the president suggested there also is that the United States would work with NATO to distribute these. Remember, the United States several years ago set up a military command. It's known as SAGU. That's Security Assistance Group Ukraine.  It's a command based in Wiesbaden, Germany that is the whole purpose of the command is to distribute security assistance to Ukraine. Hallie, I could see that NATO in some way will be more even closely coordinated with SAGU as a way to effectively and efficiently distribute things like these Patriots and any other potential  defensive weapons that the United States decides to sell to these NATO countries, or what also sounds less about, it also sounds more like this is a swapping. The United States would sell newer systems to the countries and they would provide their older systems to Ukraine.

The golden age of America has arrived. Thank you. Madam Speaker, this past weekend marked one year since the attempt on President Trump's life in Butler County, Pennsylvania. While we thank God that President Trump's life was not taken, we mourn the loss of an innocent father, a firefighter, and a proud Pennsylvanian  Cory Comparator, political violence of any kind has absolutely no place in our society. Yet the violent rhetoric coming from my colleagues across the aisle has not stopped. Now, a year after the assassination attempt on President Trump's life, they have turned their violent action toward our colleagues, ICE agents, who work every day to protect our communities.  The political violence that we are seeing in our society today will not stop unless the violent rhetoric stops. One life lost to political violence is one too many. And I ask my colleagues to remember that regardless of our political beliefs, violence is never the answer to our nation's problems.

We're going to invite you up when I finish so you can talk about those chakras. A lot of people don't realize those different areas of where we receive our thoughts, our energy.  in a real way. We're excited about this announcement today because for our children to enjoy the summer experience and families to have a great place to raise children and families, we have to use every available space that's possible as we develop their full personhood. I say over and over again, it's more than having our children be academically smart.  But they must be emotionally intelligent and grounded and well-rooted. And some of the people who stand behind me today, some of our community residents on both sides, on the left and right side of me, they play an active role in developing our neighborhoods, our partnerships, and the environment we need. And great schools, great people, and the whole city creates great community.  and a place for great children to have a pathway to success. Today, we're going to make it even better by making it easier for kids to play close to home in their own communities as part of our best budget ever. As the Deputy Mayor stated, we have opened 11 new sites in schoolyards to playgrounds program, increasing the total number  that we have opened to 313 locations. And schools are an incredible playground space. And it's a place where families and children are familiar with and know how to get to, because they get there every day during the school days. And it's a familiar environment, especially in neighborhoods without a lot of public green spaces. And when you do an analysis and look over  Many of our communities and neighborhoods did not have access to clean, open spaces, open playgrounds, open park areas, and we wanted to change that, and we're doing that every day. We want to make sure New Yorkers know that they're in the greatest city to raise a family. That means making sure our children can get outside and enjoy free play in summer days. We don't want our children sitting back playing video games every day, playing,  together is part of this socialization that children need as they continue to grow into active adults. These parks can't only be in Fort Greene Park. They cannot only be in Central Park. They must be spread throughout our entire city. So with this announcement,  We are delivering on another one of our State of the City announcements. We are putting 20,000 more New Yorkers within 10-minute walk of a green space. In the world of screens and devices, we need our parks, we need our children outdoors, interacting with other young people, and in a safe environment, and this is our way of doing so. We have to keep our city a place where everyone can raise a family.  Generation after generation, and this announcement is another way we're supporting families across the five boroughs. I just really want to thank our Park Commissioner and her team and the level of creativity. And I'm not quite clear on why, Marty, you are on the sideline. Come over here. You are Mr. Parks, man. Come and join us, you know. Talk about a great, a great New Yorker, you know. How many years?  41, 41 years and counting in Brooklyn, you know, broke us all in, from Marty Markowitz to Eric Adams. You're around through... Seven mayors. But the best one right here.  You know, just a great New Yorker. You know, we have to do something to honor some of our long-term, 40-plus-year city employees. You know, no matter who's in office, you continue to do the job. I've never met a city employee that loved their job as much as you do. You know, thank you for what you do. Now I know why you're around for so long.  So before I turn it over to our amazing commissioner, just want to also let New Yorkers know.  We're in a flood watch. It's in effect citywide until midnight tonight. We're experiencing periods of heavy rain this afternoon and evening that could lead to dangerous flash flooding. So our emergency teams have activated the city's flash flood emergency plan and are fully mobilized across agencies to protect New Yorkers. So if you live in a basement apartment,  Take it seriously.

I am a mother of two, an educator, an owner of a daycare center here in Brooklyn, and a board member of the Be Proud organization. Honestly, when I heard about Schoolyards to Playgrounds initiative, I smiled, because this is exactly what our communities need. As a parent and someone who works with children every day, I see firsthand how much it means for kids to have a safe space to play, run, and just to be free.  And when I say free, I mean the kind of joyful, unstructured play that kids need, the kind that lets them imagine, climb, laugh, fall, and get back up again. That kind of play builds more than motor skills. It builds confidence within them. This program is giving families, especially in neighborhoods that have been overlooked, more than just a place to play. It gives them a peace of mind.  I can't tell you how many parents I talk to who worry about where their child can safely go after school or on a Sunday afternoon. For many, especially single parents or those working long hours, this is not a small thing, it's everything. It's helping our kids stay active and healthy, something that's more important now than ever, especially after the isolation and screen time that came with the pandemic years. Children need to be outside.  They need sunlight, fresh air, space to move, and more importantly, they need real connection. It's bringing neighborhoods together. When schoolyards open up to the public, they don't just serve the students, they become community hubs. They become places where moms meet other moms, where kids of all ages play together, and where you hear laughter echoing down the block.  And it's reminding that every child, no matter their zip code, deserves access to green space, joy, and community. Playgrounds shouldn't be a luxury. They should be a basic part of growing up. For busy working parents like me, having more after school and weekend playgrounds option is a lifesaver. And for kids who live in apartment buildings or don't have a backyard, these playgrounds may be the only outdoor space that they get.  Our children need more time outdoors to move, explore, and just be kids, away from screens and closer to nature, even in the heart of the city. This isn't a policy, this is personal. And I'm so grateful to see this kind of change happening to our city. It shows that our leaders are listening and that they care about families like mine and yours.

Governor Cuomo now endorses the proposal. He told me a week ago that that was a non-starter for you. You've had a few days to think about it. Has your opinion changed?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 29, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 947.208, "text": " OK, first, you have to really know Cuomo. I keep telling everyone I have a master's in public administration, but a Ph.D. in Andrew. This proposal that was put out, it was Andrew's proposal. He uses people to put things out that he really would like to come later and say, OK, I endorse what an independent person is doing. He did this in Albany.  He would create these panels in consulting groups and have them put proposals that he always wanted them to put out. This is a typical Andrew show.  I know this guy better than anyone. I've studied him for years. And so to think that some independent group came up with this idea, no, it was his idea. He first plant these ideas into the universe, and everyone says it. Then he comes and act like, oh, that's a good idea, and I endorse it. Andrew is a double-digit loser in the primary.  He lost by 13 points. He had his opportunity. He spent $25 million to get his message out. New Yorkers heard it. He did not sell it. He didn't get out and campaign. I said it over and over again. You guys all heard me say he was coming out only on weekends. He was not speaking to voters. And now he's saying that we should trust him. Let me tell you what else he did.  While he was running for Trump, while he was contemplating running for office, he would go around to black and brown leaders and say, I will never run against Eric Adams. I'm only running if Eric is not going to be in the race. I'm not going to run against them. Did he keep his word? No, he did not.  You can't trust a guy. The guy will say and do anything to get elected. New York City is not a consolation prize merely because he made the determination to step down as governor. And then immediately after the primary, he surrendered again.  The resiliency and the grit of a New Yorker to run this complex city, you can't give up during difficult times. When he stepped down, I stepped up. No matter what I went through personally, and no matter what the city went through, I stayed here. I was committed to serve out my time as mayor and deliver for the city. Hard times makes strong people.  And I have known hard times. And that's why I'm able to endure all of these crises that this city had to face. And look at where we are now. Crime is down, jobs are up. The city is thriving. Our children's voices will be heard on playground. People are going to have 10 minutes walks to parks. We had 83% rate for that now. This city is moving in the right direction. And Andrew should, for once in his life, do what's best for this city and not what's best for him.  No, and that's a great question. He's saying that utilize polling to determine who should run against the Democratic primary winner. Remember, polls showed him up 40 points.  40 points. The day before the primary, his spokesperson put out the results of a poll that said he was up 10 points. He lost by 13 points. So, if we're going to use these methods of making this determination that they have already proven inaccurate, why are we going to put the risk of New Yorkers by someone who has not kept his word,  as he has a consistent record of not keeping his word. Why are we going to trust him now? He's also stated after the election that let's wait and see what the rank-choice numbers are going to be. That's what he said. The rank-choice numbers came out. Now he has another idea. So he will keep moving the goalposts as much as possible. This is just who he is. He can't help himself.  Don't get angry at him. He just can't help himself. Trust me. I served with him in Albany. I watched what he did when he stepped down. He just can't help himself. And you can't trust him at his word.  We'll do two more. Where have you been?

Go do research on what he has done.  and all of the task force and panels that he has created over time. This is a typical Andrew Cuomo playbook. You send someone out, make the announcement independently, and then you come later and seem like you're the fairest person. If you're the fairest person, think about what he did. He knew that I already made it clear I was not going to be in the Democratic primary. I was going to be on the independent line.  He knew that Madani was going to be on the Rokin's family line. So why did he all of a sudden say, now I'm going to join the independent petition? He knew the scenario. His desire was to, I'm going to force Eric out of the race.  I'm the city mayor. And you will say to yourself, well, why would he do that? Look at his record. He did the same thing to Karl McCaul. When Karl McCaul wanted to be the first black governor, he got into the race on the liberal line, and Karl McCaul lost. He did the same thing to Charlie King. Charlie King raised $5 million to become the first African-American AG. He got in the race and forced Charlie King out.  He did the same thing to Governor Patterson. He wrote behind the scene and sabotaged Governor Patterson re-election campaign, and Governor Patterson left. He did the same thing to Keith Wright when he wanted to be the first African-American to be the speaker. He sabotaged his race. Andrew has a thing for African-American leaders, and he believes that he could just come in and bully them out. I keep telling people, I'm from Brownsville, never run, never will.

And now we see people on our street with severe psychiatric issues because the beds were closed. I can go through the list. This is a very important moment for New Yorkers. This has been a person in government who always thought it was about him and not about the people he was serving.  He cannot do what he has done in the past. He's come up against a resilient, committed mayor that loves this city. Let me get my message out. My message has not been properly reported, how I turned around this city, and I'm going to have an opportunity.  to do what he did for $25 million. I'm going to have an opportunity to campaign. I'm going to speak to New Yorkers and people going to see what I did about maternal morbidity and black and brown parents, what I did about public safety.

I put $30 billion back into the pockets of New Yorkers. Paying off medical debt, paying for the college tuition for foster care, children, lowering the cost of child care, reducing no taxes for low-income New Yorkers, no income taxes for low-income New Yorkers. I'm not talking about affordability. I'm using my role as mayor to deliver for working-class people. And people don't even know that.  I got to now communicate that. They heard Cuomo's message. They heard it. He spent $25 million. He did weekend campaigning. He lost by double digits, 13 points. He lost by 13 points. The same polls that said he was up by 10 points. And we're now going to trust that same system to allow him to run? Nah, that doesn't make any sense. Come on. New Yorkers are not that dumb. I keep telling people New Yorkers have five fingers.

You guys all heard me say he was coming out only on weekends. He was not speaking to voters. And now he's saying that we should trust him. Let me tell you what else he did.  While he was running for Trump, while he was contemplating running for office, he would go around to black and brown leaders and say, I will never run against Eric Adams. I'm only running if Eric is not going to be in the race. I'm not going to run against them. Did he keep his word? No, he did not.  You can't trust a guy.

When he stepped down, I stepped up. No matter what I went through personally, and no matter what the city went through, I stayed here. I was committed to serve out my time as mayor and deliver for the city. Hard times makes strong people.  And I have known hard times.

The tariffs are going to cause inflation. Tariffs are going to cause a recession. Tariffs are going to cause a spike in prices. Well, what do we find out this week? This kills the media to report it, by the way.  Japanese automakers announce what? They're going to raise prices? No. Japanese automakers announced this week that they are slashing auto prices for imports coming into the United States. Now, why are they doing that? Why are they doing that? They're doing that because the tariffs force them to be competitive.  They can't pass on the cost to the consumers, because we're not going to pay that, right? So they have to cut prices. That's just one of many examples. And then today, late today, this was so great on a Friday, because sometimes Fridays, news cycles aren't so great. But today was great.

Now, let's go back a year, when Sleepy Joe was getting ready for that debate and he was all shot up with a B12 or whatever the heck they were giving him, peppy pills that didn't kick in. So remember that, last June, what was happening?  a $74 billion budget deficit for the month of June.

All right, on job creation. Again, America first works. Anytime someone tells you it doesn't, it does.  So for job creation, last year, jobs created in the Biden administration, only 52% went to native-born Americans. Okay? 52%. Ridiculous, right? So much of it was going to illegal immigrants or foreign workers. From January to the end of June, 100% of the new jobs went to native-born Americans.  Awesome. Love it. It's so great. All right.

This is a Maha Medicaid. We'll take it. But Medicaid was created, and it's a very precious entity. Medicare and Medicaid are the backbone of the social safety net of our country. We must preserve these entities.  Medicare, of course, wasn't touched in the one big beautiful law, but Medicaid was addressed because there's fraud, waste, and abuse, as Dr. Barrasso addressed. He's a physician, by the way, and an excellent doctor. So he understands both sides, the legal side as well as the medical side. If you're able-bodied and able to work and you're not, on average you're spending 6.1 hours a day watching television or just hanging out, video games, other things.  So, we're saying you ought to try to go to work. It's better for you and it's better for the country. We've got twice as many jobs as people available to do those jobs. So we don't even call it work requirement, it's community engagement. And what the law says is you've got to try to get a job, ideally try to get 20 hours of work in if you can, or volunteer, or go get an education. And we're actually already doing pilots in two different states to get the technology ready. But if you're not willing to take that deal,  then yes, you'll lose Medicaid. But I actually think, and I have confidence in the American people, they will do this. And we have a real-life example. Eighteen months ago, the Biden administration, under duress, realized the crisis that was taking place at Medicaid and began to unwind the COVID-era changes. Those are what we were primarily addressing with this law. Fifteen million people came off Medicaid. However, less than 10 percent became uninsured.

In what country do you spend $200 billion more and your opposition accuses you of cutting? At least get the words right. We're investing more in Medicaid.  The rural hospitals get less than 5% of the extra money that comes from state-derived payments. So most of the money that's given from the federal government to the states actually goes to the big city hospitals that are well-connected, have lobbyists. So it was a dishonest narrative. However, there is a need to transform American medicine. I took this job for that reason.  I think we can do so much to make health care efficient that that will ultimately make the system viable. So the $50 billion, we call it the Rural Transformation Fund. It will help hospitals in rural areas thrive. It will get more people to work in those hospitals. We have a worker shortage. And this is the most important thing, Stuart. Sitting here in the studio, there's technology everywhere.  In an operating room, my day job before this all started, that's what I had as well. But patients don't deal with technology and the healthcare system. We need a modernization movement driven by technology, and that is coming to fruition. And this $50 billion fund will not just pay expenses.  It'll actually transform this business, and we have a meeting, a summit on the 30th of July at the White House with the president to discuss this very issue. If we make healthcare function the way banks function, the way you can order food, the way you can watch streaming videos, transform it to be a 21st century industry, it'll become productive again.

So in the cutthroat world of AI, this was a knife twist. OpenAI lined up a $3 billion acquisition only to watch Google walk off with the talent. Now, Windsurf, as Carl mentioned, it's a buzzy AI coding startup. It was deep in acquisition talks with OpenAI. The idea was to fold its tech and user base into OpenAI's expanding app layer.  But then, late Friday night, Google swoops in, not with an acquisition, but another one of these pseudo-Aqua hires, a $2.4 billion talent play for Windsurf's CEO and key engineers, leading to a key question here, guys. Why did OpenAI lose this deal? I'm told by a source that Microsoft loomed large. It is, of course, OpenAI's biggest investor, but Windsurf reportedly had concerns about sharing its technology with Microsoft  as part of the deal with OpenAI, especially since Microsoft's own copilot, it directly competes in AI coding. Now, of course, Google didn't have that baggage. So now those engineers will report to Sundar Pichai and DeepMind, not Sam Altman. Now, this all suggests that OpenAI's entanglement with Microsoft  It's becoming more of a liability, not just as open AI pushes to restructure into a for-profit and raise fresh capital, but also in M&A during these cutthroat talent wars. Now, this all matters for investors because the rules of engagement in AI, they are changing. With a regulatory climate that is still unfriendly to full acquisitions by the megacaps, the path to scale isn't M&A, it's talent poaching and license deals. And that means that companies building the models  and that have the infrastructure to train them, they are structurally advantaged. That is harder to disrupt, despite Trump's administration's push to help so-called little tech, the startups, like the ones on the bottom of your screen here, who have all sort of sold out to big tech. So the power is shifting back to\u2014or you could say it is staying with the biggest players, the mega-caps. Now, this helps explain also, guys, why Meta and Zuckerberg are spending billions of dollars to build their own models and deploy sovereign scale  infrastructure, it all comes together with stories like these ones.

She would have recently celebrated her second birthday, but this was snatched away by the very people who should have protected and cared for her.  This was an incredibly challenging investigation for the hundreds of officers who were involved in the search. Our main focus throughout the search was finding Victoria alive and we all remained devastated by her death. As anyone who's followed this trial will know, it was an incredibly complex investigation. Mark Gordon and Constance Martin deliberately avoided the authorities and continued to shield Victoria from us even after their arrest.  This meant even the most experienced child pathologists in the country were unable to establish the cause of Victoria's death. We know today's verdict won't bring Victoria back, but I'm pleased our painstaking investigation has resulted in those who caused her death being brought to justice. Victoria's death was completely avoidable. The couple had plenty of opportunities to do the right thing and come forward to ask for help.  They knew throughout that officers were looking for them and baby Victoria. They also ignored medical professionals who directly reached out to them to say that their actions were putting baby Victoria at risk. In court, Martin said they moved around a lot to avoid one single authority having jurisdiction over their daughter.  Martin stated that her children had been stolen by the state, referring to the social care system after her previous four children were removed from her by the family court. I would like to personally thank the media for the positive support you showed throughout this search. The many members of the public who reported sightings and Sussex Police for the support provided in the arrests and subsequent search for Victoria. This support was incredibly important to the investigation throughout.  Speaking personally as a father, I find it hard to comprehend how instead of providing the warmth and care that their child needed, Mark Gordon and Constance Martin chose to live outside during freezing conditions to avoid the authorities causing the death of baby Victoria. Throughout the trial, both defendants made repeated attempts to disrupt and frustrate the judicial process.  employing tactics designed to undermine proceedings and shift the focus away from the serious charges that they faced. Their behaviour ranged from non-cooperation and persistent interruptions aimed at delaying this progress. Despite these challenges, the professionalism, the resilience of their legal advocates, the judge and the court staff ensured that the integrity of the trial was maintained throughout.  Through careful case management, clear judicial direction and a steadfast commitment to due process, the court was able to navigate these obstructions effectively.

The European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too.  We're in for a lot of money and we just, we don't want to do anymore. And we can't, but we make the best and we're going to be sending the best to NATO and in some cases to maybe at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany where they're going to send early on missiles.  And they'll be replaced, and NATO's going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here. He's a great ambassador, and Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So in a nutshell, we're going to make top of the line weapons and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something and be mostly in the form of a replacement.  And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy for having had the career that he's had. He had an amazing career before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months. And if you could say a few words. Absolutely. No, no, Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you don't want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent.  but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defence industrial production. So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have the Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more.  So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hexhead at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for that. So I really want to thank you for that. That means the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here. So really, thank you. This is important."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 243.734, "text": "Thank you."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 243.954, "text": "You did a great job. That's a really great job.  We've been very successful in settling wars. You have India-Pakistan. You have Rwanda and the Congo. That was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled. And they did. And they were both great. Great leaders. And they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years.  And at least 7 million people killed and killed with.  A lot of pretty rough weapons, like machetes, heads chopped off, going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near, so frightening. And we got that one solved. Serbia, Kosovo, got that solved. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I used. I used strafe for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars.  And that was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here on the strip, the Gaza Strip. I call it the Gaza Strip, one of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace. It brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Witkoff is here. And I think we could have something fairly soon to  talk about. And we solved another one, one that we just seem to have Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with an extra neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which  Closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we're working on that one problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that. You've been hearing about that one.  And that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam. But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income and life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia.  I'm not happy, and I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started. If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye.  But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they're going to they're going to have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. And I was outside looking in. And I said, yeah, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started.  It's a real mess. We're losing, I guess they're losing 5 or 6,000 people. There's actually now more. I used to, I was saying 5,000 a day. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up too. It's a horrible war and it should be stopped. And so if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing. Secondary tariffs and they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do. But I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk. And then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people.  It's got to stop. It's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars' worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States, going to NATO, et cetera. And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance.  They still would have had no chance if the equipment, they had the best equipment, because we do make the best planes and missiles. And we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. We have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about the Golden Dome. It's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage because somebody has to use that equipment.  And they fought with tremendous courage and they continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they don't have, they're losing on equipment. And Russia has really taken a very positive, very, very  strong, I mean, what they've done in the last couple of weeks. Without military reasons, that's what they are doing. 700 drones a day, missiles, bombing cities. This is not because of military goals. It is just creating panic, keeping people out of their sleeps, hitting towns. It's really terrible. And it is meaning a lot of people lose their lives, but also the infrastructure, whole cities being  They're wiping out the electric. It's going to take years to rebuild it. That's going to be the next problem. But that's going to take a long time. Many of the cities are knocked down to the ground. Many of the people have left. But many have stayed. I don't know. They actually stay. Most have stayed, actually. It's incredible that they stay, knowing that a missile could be hitting your apartment house.  And your apartment house that you're sitting in could collapse on top of you. And they do very heavy construction. They don't use rebar. They do very thick concrete construction. Those are heavy buildings, big buildings and heavy buildings. And they collapse like  like they're made out of paper. It's unbelievable to see this happening with people, so many people being killed. So we think we're going to make progress and we hope we're going to make progress. In the meantime, we're going to get you good service on what you need. And we really became friendly with NATO this last meeting. You know, we went from 2% to 5%, which everyone said  was not even a possibility. They weren't paying 2%. Many of them were paying much less than 2%. But even those, since you became president, all committed to the 2% before the summit. And now, collectively, we committed to the 5%. That's right. They did. They've been very good. And I think I made a lot of friends over there. We had a couple of days of very intensive talks.  And they're great people. They're leaders of countries, leaders of countries. Many of them great countries, some of them smaller countries. But for the most part, that's a very solid, strong countries and very successful. Some of them are among the most successful countries in the world.  So that's the story. We hope that's going to have an impact on Vladimir Putin. And we hope it's going to have an impact on Ukraine also. We want to make sure that Ukraine does what they have to do. All of a sudden they have, they may feel emboldened or maybe they don't want, you know, this is a very  difficult situation. Ukraine wants a peace deal. I think so. And they will stay committed to that. There's no doubt they want it. But the Russians have to be. They have to continue to want it, though.

I get, we get thousands of letters a week, Susie, right? Thousands. I mean, tens of thousands sometimes. I look at a room, there's a room where we have many, many people working, responding.  sending letters back. That's what an auto pen supposed to be to write to a young seven-year-old boy that writes to the president. And he wants to be president someday. And he loves America. That's what the auto pen supposed to be. It's not supposed to be for signing major legislation and all the things. No, the auto pen. And I doubt he knew. I doubt I doubt they even spoke to him about it. I think they had if it's called the freewheeling auto pen.  Like, Biden was never for open borders. Biden was never for transgender for everyone.

It is look at our numbers Look at the numbers. We made you see we made 25 billion last month  We didn't make that for years. The tariffs are kicking in. The economy is very strong, even though we have a Fed person who's terrible. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing, but that's all right. We blow through interest rates. We're doing so well, we blow through it. It'd be nice because people would be able to buy housing a lot easier. But think of it.  We thought your country was dead.

Mark Rutte, Secretary General of NATO. Highly respected by everybody that knows him, but in particular the European countries. They have great reliance on him. And he's done a fantastic job. And we had a tremendous meeting.  I guess it's about a month now, a month ago. And I think Mark will tell you that it was really perhaps more important the date of November 5th. That was the election day. Maybe that was the most important because we've made tremendous progress together. And one of the reasons that you're here today is to hear that we are very unhappy, I am, with Russia.  But we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with them, and we're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. Tariffs at about 100 percent. You'd call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And, as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine.  And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it. And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there. So, based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. It's very simple. And they'll be at 100 percent. And that's the way it is. It can be more simple. It's just the way it is. I hope we don't have to do it.  But regardless, we are going to be \u2014 we make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's missiles \u2014 you saw that recently in Iran, the way those planes flew in.

And what job would I be interested in?  He said, Christy, I know people have talked to you before about different cabinet positions, maybe interior ag, something like that. And I said, Mr. President, what I would most like to do for you is to be your Secretary of Homeland Security.  And he said, really? Why? And I said, sir, because it is your number one priority. It's your number one priority. And I think that you're going to have to have somebody who's actually strong enough to do it, that it's a hard job, and somebody is going to actually have to follow through on it. And I also think that you need somebody who can communicate about it.  someone who is a wife and a mom and a grandma that can talk to families and recognize how the policies and what we're doing to make our country safer is better for all Americans and will help protect our communities for our kids and our grandkids to grow up and have the same opportunities that we have each and every day. I'm just so blessed and honored that he gave me that privilege to serve in this role. Now,  The Department of Homeland Security was created after 9-11. It was created in response to the terror attacks that hit the New York City and the World Trade Towers. And it was a bunch of different agencies and the federal government all put under one umbrella, whose mission is to defend the security of the homeland, and to do so with honor and integrity. Therefore, I have 23 different components in my agency.  You know that it is my job and Customs and Border Protection's job and Border Patrol's job in order to go out and secure the border. President Trump has secured our border for the United States of America. He's given me fantastic partners in Tom Holman and Stephen Miller and Rodney Scott.  Tim Todd-Lyons, who's out there running ICE for us. We want to thank all of our light ICE officers for what they do every day on interior law enforcement as well.  Over 99% of the people that were coming through the Darien Gap over a year and a half ago, do you remember the hundreds of thousands of people that were coming through there, coming into the United States of America? Now we have reverse migration, going the opposite direction, out of the United States, back to their home countries. A 94% decrease in people coming to the border.

People have been saying this is a company, Xiaomi, that is a household name, and they really like the look. In fact, a lot of people are saying that the design elements remind them of a Ferrari. Now, I got a chance to test drive this car, and there are a lot of fun tech elements. There's a magnetic  tissue box Gadgets, which of course is like a vintage thing for for Xiaomi as well as the the screen It's much easier to use people have been talking about how it's almost exactly like a smartphone and then of course there are The some of the the comfort levels actually the comfort elements are quite nice as well You can lie all the way back as a driver in one of their seats  It doesn't handle though quite as well as one might hope when I was driving it. The precision really wasn't necessarily there and so that's one of the, even though it's a good performance car, a lot of the commentary online has been that it's just slightly below the Model Y in that aspect. Xiaomi though,  has done well. It is a new entrant to the EV market. It entered the market last year with a competitor to the Model 3. This is called the Su-7, and it sold 155,000 of those cars in the first half of the year. The U7 is getting off to a pretty good start. The company claims that it has pre-orders  in the first 24 hours of 240,000. Meanwhile, of course, Tesla's Model Y has been down in the first half. It's now seen its sales at 263,000.

I mean, the president came in and wanted to establish peace.  Certainly, between Ukraine and Russia, Ukraine, after stumbling in the Oval Office, agreed to a ceasefire without any conditions. Putin has put that off for months. The president exhibited an enormous amount of patience, largely because, you know, when they're talking to each other, Putin talks nice. You know, he talks about mutual economic benefit. He says, I'm as interested in peace as you are, Mr. President.  But then, Putin plays hard on the battlefield. The truth is, during that entire time, he escalated the war, particularly against civilians, as we have all seen. The last few days have demonstrated the culmination of that, the scale and size of that escalation. Five, six hundred things flying in the sky, largely against civilian targets.  So, the president is frustrated. Putin wanted him to get frustrated. And he wanted the president to pull away, Dana, and stop supporting Ukraine just out of frustration and leave it alone. But that's not happening. While he achieved his goal in frustrating the president, the president is not pulling away. He's actually going to turn the war around somewhat here, because he's going to do two things.  One, he's going to increase military assistance, let the Europeans buy our weapons systems. They have the money to do it. And they're either going to let Ukraine buy them from them or they're going to give them to Ukraine. So we're going to up gun Ukraine's capability. And believe me,  Putin pays serious attention to battlefield effects, because that is where his head is. And we're also going to authorize the Senate and eventually the House, and the Europeans are going to do the same in terms of some pretty tough sanctions.  particularly on those who are buying Russian oil. That's China, India, and Brazil. So both of these put together is kind of one-two punch here to go right at the problem here with Russia on the battlefield and also their kind of revenue source that obviously is essential for them to keep their troops on the battlefield trained and well-equipped.

So Ukraine has been conducting a remarkable successful defense.  against a force that doubles them in size on the ground. And Putin has increased the targeting of civilian, which in of itself is a war crime. And he's increased the kidnapping of children and moving them into Russia, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20,000, which is just horrific when you think of something like that. So yeah, why is he doing that and the focus on civilians? He wants to break the will of the Ukrainian people  and undermine their support for the government and for the war, that they throw their hands up and say, enough is enough. And that would force Zelensky to go make major concessions to the Russians. And that's not happening because the Ukrainian people are steadfast. They are still supporting Zelensky.

You might come in with an idea, and he'll bring up tariffs. You might come in talking about tariffs. He'll talk about being able to have a deportation regime with you.

He is now coming off of a very successful Midnight Hammer operation, where he made the right call  And that has changed the game as far as negotiating with Iran and Middle East partners. He needs to change the game with Putin. And that's why he's looking at everything on the table. Again, I mentioned a lot of these things have been on the table before.

But notably, as President Trump has made clear in the last 24 hours, this is going to be paid for with European dollars. He might even announce today that he's going to be seizing money that is frozen in bank accounts that Russia has had in the West, and those monies are going to pay for weapons. So this is an America first version of what Biden did before. He's taking it into his own hands and changing it.  As far as sanctions, sanctions is a whack-a-mole operation. That's why when people bring up how many sanctions Donald Trump has done as opposed to Biden, they always mention this enormous number that Biden put on against Russia. And that's because they kept having to be updated, because once you put on sanctions on a company, they'll just start a new company and run their money through that way. So we need to keep updating them.  Notably, Europe has done the 17th and 18th tranche of sanctions just this year alone, and America is behind on that. That's why I believe that this Senate bill will be passed by the 25th of this month. And then further on, we want to see Europe building up their armaments right on Russia's border, because so far Russia has contained the battlefield just to Ukraine.

Because Ukraine had Russia on the run numerous times, and if America had provided even more weapons, we would be in a vastly different place. I think President Trump is not going to be the first person to blink in this kind of conflict. And so far, over the course of Putin's presidency, he has threatened nuclear war since the first week of his administration.  since the early 2000s. So what needs to be done is somebody needs to come in and say, we're going to press along what we want to do. If you want to go ahead and change the game with nuclear weapons, that's on you.

And as far as ourselves, we have been involved with the government from day one. The  Essentially, two of the national labs from the Department of Energy have helped us since we initially found this. We have got some discussions going back channel right now with the Defense Department.

So I think government involvement at this point in the game is necessary.  Whether that continues throughout the cycle of rare earths over the decades and years ahead, it remains to be seen. But I do know that the nation has a critical need and a strategic need for rare earths. As Secretary Wright just said, what do you use rare earths for? Everything that you push a button on.

And still, Constance Martin and Mark Gordon managed to travel hundreds of miles from the north of the country to the south. This is how they evaded the authorities.  Constance Martin was reported missing on the 5th of January. That same evening, the car she'd been travelling in with partner Mark Gordon caught fire on the M61 near Bolton. Van driver Ken Hudson had been behind them on the motorway. He pulled over to help them and called the emergency services. The couple left on foot, heading towards Bolton.  They left behind a placenta wrapped in a towel and Martin's passport, along with a bag of more than 30 mobile phones, used nappies, a cat in a pet carrier, and a Bible. A local resident gave them a lift into Bolton, where they were seen at the Bolton Interchange bus station, before deciding to take a taxi 35 miles to Liverpool, paying \u00a380. From there, they flagged down another taxi, which took them 270 miles across the country to Harwich in Essex.  Driver Ali Yaria said the woman was shivering and he saw a baby inside the woman's jacket wearing only a nappy. In Harwich, they checked into a Premier Inn using a false name, Thomas. Hotel staff said Martin paid in cash and seemed, quote, quite distressed. After being asked to leave in the morning because they couldn't provide proof of identity, they moved to the Friart Hotel for the night. They checked out early the next morning.  Martin was seen outside Harwich Port two hours later. A member of the public confronted the couple, having seen a news report about their disappearance. Dale Gosling said that a baby was wrapped inside Martin's coat and that he heard crying. The couple then took a taxi from Harwich to Colchester. Then, later that morning, another taxi from Colchester to East Ham in East London. CCTV showed the couple getting out of the cab with their baby girl, Victoria.  Martin cradling the child under her jacket. Later that day, Gordon bought a buggy in Argos before meeting Martin in a kebab shop. She assembled the buggy and then put the baby in. They then took a series of taxis around London, abandoning the buggy and, prosecutors said, transferring the baby to a little shopping bag instead. From North London, they headed to the port town of New Haven, arriving at five in the morning.  A CCTV camera at a petrol station shows them wandering around in the early hours, before heading towards the South Downs on foot. They weren't seen again until four days later. Martin was back at the garage, buying sweets, snacks and petrol. They claimed the baby had already died by this point. The next sighting was on the outskirts of Brighton. Gordon was spotted emerging from a tent in the woods in Stanmer Park.  Two weeks later, the Met Police offered a \u00a310,000 reward for information. But it was more than a fortnight before witnesses reported further sightings. One near Hollingbury Golf Course in Brighton. Another in the Coldeen Lane area of the city. And back in Stanmer Park a day later. Witness Pauline Mason told the court she saw a mother with a baby who she believed was dead.  On the 20th of February, the pair were captured on CCTV, trying and failing to break into Hollingbury Golf Course and rummaging through the bins. A week later, they were back in the same area. This time, though, they would not go unnoticed. Their run was about to come to an end. They were spotted in a local shop buying food and withdrawing cash. A member of the public who recognised them from media reporting called the police.  And a few minutes later, the couple were arrested in nearby Stanmore Villas. You're under arrest for child neglect.

Good morning. I'm California Attorney General Rob Bonta, and I am joined by my colleagues, which I'm very proud to be able to do, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell,  and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Narona. And we're here today to announce the latest lawsuit we filed against the Trump administration for unlawfully and arbitrarily freezing $6.8 billion in education grants owed to states across the nation.  Here in California, nearly 940 million, almost a billion dollars is on the line. Funds, mind you, that Congress lawfully approved and appropriated, as is their job, as is their role in our constitutional democracy, a responsibility given to them by the U.S. Constitution. Congress holds the power of the purse, not the president.  President Trump and Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon have dealt a debilitating blow to our schools, throwing them into chaos just weeks ahead of the first day of school for many districts. Already ongoing summer learning programs have been forced to shut down.  thoughtful strategic budgets, staffing plans, and contracts for the upcoming school year hang in the balance. Sadly, this is just the latest in a long string of unlawful attacks on K-12 education in our country since Trump took office. And make no mistake, our kids are the ones who will suffer the consequences and are suffering the consequences.  In California, more than 5,800,000 children, almost 6 million, stand in the crosshairs of Trump's campaign to demolish education in America. My colleagues and I refuse to stand idly by and allow the president to torch our children's education, care, opportunities, and futures, all the while breaking the law, violating the Constitution,  and trampling over the separation of powers. Before I dive into the details, I want to acknowledge that our lawsuit is the result of the incredible partnership and collaboration of a coalition of 23 attorneys general and two states and each of their teams, including the folks on my team in California, DOJ's Civil Rights Enforcement and Health Education and Welfare sections. So thanks to all the team members that got us to this day. We have the honor and privilege as the attorneys general  talk about the cases and lead our teams, but this is very much a team effort and I'm grateful for everyone's work to get us to this point. Trump and McMahon's actions are hurting children, hurting teachers and schools across the nation, which is why we're standing arm in arm from coast to coast, united in our determination to hold this administration accountable to the fundamentally American principle that every student has the right to equitable access to education.  Trump and McMahon are waging a campaign to sever that access. They've made it clear that they've little regard for the law and no qualms risking our children's academic success and futures. In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks,  Eight of them challenged unlawful attacks on education. This time, the administration froze $6.8 billion in federal funding owed to states, a quarter of which should have been available July 1st. Instead, on June 30th, the U.S. Department of Education sent a three-sentence-long boilerplate email from a nondescript address alerting states that we wouldn't receive the funds we were waiting for. We were relying on, planning to use, and distribute and disperse.  The dismissive note came with little explanation or reasoning, let alone any legal basis. Let's be clear, Trump and McMahon have no right to hold these funds back.  And in doing so, they're jeopardizing critical programs our students, families, and schools rely on, including afterschool and summer learning programs, tutoring to help students in English and math, programs that train and prepare teachers so they're better equipped to teach our kids, support for children learning English, projects to improve our schools, and funding that helps ensure children who move around because their parents are migrant workers don't fall through the cracks or fall behind.  Without the $6.8 billion in nationwide federal funding that's now frozen, districts and schools have been thrown into chaos, left with no choice but to consider pausing or shutting down programs and laying off teachers and staff. Some programs have already been shuttered, including summer programs that were already underway.  The 21st century community learning centers at nearly 700 sites across California are on the line. These centers provide academic enrichment programs to disadvantaged children outside of regular school hours. They help students meet standards in reading and math. And during the summer, they provide meals to students, a lifeline to families in need.  The Migrant Education Program, which serves 78,000 students at 20 regional programs across the state, has been hit hard by this funding freeze and you can be sure the migrant youth and families who rely on it will feel the impact, unfortunately, feel the pain. The California Adult Literacy Professional Development Project, which trains educators who teach adult education, has been instructed to do the bare minimum to stay afloat. They've already had to end or pause contracts with educators and  small businesses. Trump and McMahon are wreaking havoc on our states and schools, rocking families who count on the support and stability of these programs and holding our children back from their full potential. It's unconscionable, unlawful, and can't go unchecked. And it won't. With this lawsuit, my colleagues and I are asking the court to immediately block any attempt to withhold or delay this funding.  Last week I had the opportunity to spend the afternoon at a summer program at Bel Air Park Elementary School in Napa, California. I saw firsthand the care, compassion, education, and programming made possible by the County Office of Education, the school district, and the expanded learning team.  as well as AmeriCorps tutors and mentors. I watched them make minestrone soup in their cooking class and even chopped some onions with them. I saw the art projects they were working on. I saw the exercise that they were getting, including giving me a run for my own money in zombie tag. They called it Z tag. I saw how much the program meant to those kids, how irreplaceable it is for them,  and their families. I talked to volunteers and educators who devoted their careers to teaching and supporting our young kids. Fortunately, so far the county has been able to backfill the federal funding the program didn't get on July 1, but let's be clear that is a band-aid solution.  Their before, after, and summer school programs are all at risk, programs that serve the community's highest need schools. As their associate superintendent said, this freeze is, quote, yet another federal action that introduces pain and uncertainty into the educational system of our community.  Trump may wrongly claim he's going after waste, fraud, and abuse, but the unfortunate irony is the long-term cost of Trump's unlawful attack on our students, families, schools, and communities is tremendous. Working parents will be left without reliable, affordable childcare. Teachers and staff will join the growing throng of unemployed Americans thanks to Trump's anti-worker policies, and students will fall behind.  In 2022, out of 37 developed nations, American students ranked 28th in math and 12th in science. Those numbers don't stand a chance of improving if you slash before, after, and summer school programming, fire tutors, cut programs that teach English and support disadvantaged students, and programs that ensure our teachers are the best they can be and prevent schools from bringing in the technology and resources they need to educate our children.  President Trump can shout America first all he wants, but his anti-education agenda will only ensure we come in dead last.  It shouldn't be too much to ask that the President of the United States follow the law. And yet, we've had to sue him 31 times in 25 weeks for breaking the law, undermining Congress's authority, and failing to make good on federal financial obligations. As a former businessman, you'd think he'd have learned that you can't rack up a list of unpaid debts and get away with it.  Our states are owed the billions in federal funding that Trump and McMahon have frozen, and we're going to court to see that it's reinstated. Before I turn it over to my colleagues to say a few words, I want to shout out the incredible public servants at California DOJ who've worked hard to make today's lawsuit possible. Jewel Boyd, Lee Sherman, Jesse Bassbaum, Elia Herrera, Emilia Morris, Christopher Tenorio, Joshua Sodheimer, Virginia Corrigan, Irina Trasobin. Thank you.  It's an honor to serve alongside each and every one of you. And with that, please allow me to now turn it over to my colleague, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit against the Trump administration for freezing $6.8 billion in education grants.

Thank you, Secretary Kennedy and Secretary Rawlings. We wouldn't be here were it not for both of your vision to make this happen, so thank you. Secretary Rawlings, you've been the perfect partner in this.  We first said we want to remove all nine petroleum-based food dyes from the U.S. food supply and do it soon. The naysayers said it would not be possible. And here we are weeks later with an announcement that nearly 40 percent of food manufacturers have  raise their hand to say, yes, we agree. There are no Democrat or Republican children in America. They are children. And so we can do this because we now have enough reason to be concerned about these petroleum-based food dyes. We don't need to wait for a 10-year randomized controlled trial. Parents are telling us  that when a kid has abnormal behavior and they try reducing or eliminating petroleum-based food dyes, they have seen behavior improve. That is data. May not be a 10-year randomized controlled trial, but if we listen to parents, there are learnings there for the medical establishment. There are also randomized controlled trials also raising these health concerns with the petroleum-based food dyes.  Now, we believe in options, so that means we want natural dyes to be available to food makers and ice cream makers. Normally, every couple years the FDA will spit out one natural food dye approval. But on the charge of Secretary Kennedy, we have made this a priority, and Kyle Diamantis, who's standing here in charge of the food program at the FDA,  has made this a priority such that in the very short time we have been in office, we have now the fourth natural food dye from natural ingredients approved by the FDA. Today, I'm announcing that the FDA is approving Gardenia Blue as a natural food dye with natural ingredients.  We believe in options and we believe in incremental improvements in health. The sickness of American kids is not a willpower problem. It's not their fault. We can do things that will make the food supply healthier one step at a time.  So with that, I just want to reemphasize that this is a renaissance moment in health in America, and part of that is rewriting the broken food and nutrition guidelines of the United States. No longer are we going to have a broken food pyramid and a continuation of a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat that began with Dr. Ancel Keys.  We are going to have dietary guidelines that are based on science, not based on medical dogma.

And Tom Homan just looking at him makes you want to board a bus and go to Tijuana.  He gives off a vibe that shaving cream is for wussies. He's a walking, talking human version of the wall. Now compare that to the previous Borders are. The only people she put fear into are the bartenders who cut her off.  Steve, is he not the perfect man for the job? Listen, absolutely perfect. He's a complete badass. And, you know, it was like 3 o'clock high. He said, I'll meet you at the final bell, right, on the side of the stage here. And there's a thing called old guy strength, which I'm sure he has, right? And the military and law enforcement his entire life, and believe me, he would end up on the top of that showdown if it were to happen. But to your point about deterrence, too, to be serious for a second, that's such a big deal. According to the New York Post, 1 million illegals have self-deported already.  And counting, right? Every single day. And also, we've incentivized self-deportation. But that deterrence effect is so massive. And the great thing is, people like Debbie Wasserman Schultz amplifies it by saying how horrible the conditions are. Oh my God, they have to poop and brush their teeth in the same place. Yeah, it's called a bathroom, lady.  Well yeah, what does she do in her house? Yeah, well I poop in the closet, and I brush my teeth in the bathroom.

You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes, then it's easier to stop them. And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language. I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. I know Putin very well from the days when I was prime minister. And then once you have to test him, and you did this, and you really gave him a chance to be serious, to get to the table.  Well, as we told you at the top of the program, President Trump is sending additional weapons to NATO countries for distribution to Ukraine. It's part of his effort to try to end the war with Russia. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was on hand for that announcement, as you saw in the Oval Office. He joins us on set tonight. Mr. Secretary General, thanks for being here. Good to be on the program. What's your takeaway from your meeting today and that announcement and how significant it is?  This is really significant. So last Thursday, I got a call from President Trump. He said, hey, Mark, we really want to ramp up the support for Ukraine when it comes to weapons. And then this morning, I was in the White House preparing for the meeting with him. And he said, when it comes to the sanctions, clearly, we have to take the next step now. And he can only dialogue once. So he has to take this step by step. I totally understand that.  But he was really, I think, irritated with his last phone call with Putin, who is not serious, it seems, about getting into peace negotiations. So now there's a 50-day deadline. Essentially, the president put that on the table today. And you think that the sanctions on other countries doing deals with Russia will create additional pressure, exponential?  Absolutely. This is significant. So today if you are in Beijing or in Delhi or you're in Brazil and you know that this is coming to you, you might want to call Vladimir or Vladimir Putin and say, hey friend, we are still buying stuff from you, but you have got to get serious when it comes to these negotiations on a ceasefire or a peace deal, or otherwise we get hit by these secondary sanctions. There will be also an effect directly on Russia, of course.  But this is really significant. And it is smartly designed by the president. What about the weapons themselves? Why not the U.S. directly to Kiev? Why through European countries? Well, there are two sides to this. One is the logistics. And NATO is good at logistics. So get the weapons into Ukraine in a way that they can make maximum use of them. So packaged in packages which are really useful. And for them to be maximum effective. And then, of course, is the issue of who is paying for it. And the president  And I totally understand this. He said, hey, listen, Mark, we want to deliver these weapons into Ukraine, making sure that they can sustain in the fight, that they somehow are able to defend themselves against the Russians. But you guys in Europe have to pay for it. And I think that's fair. We had the NATO summit, which was a huge foreign policy success for President Trump. Europeans stepping up. And here again, the Europeans are stepping up, taking responsibility to pay for these weapons.  You know, Vladimir Putin has shown no indication he's going to stop this. And obviously, you've talked to the president about how much these phone calls have irritated him. We have this chart that shows the number of attacks, drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, sometimes right after these phone calls going up. So what is it going to take? How much more support for Ukraine to get to the table?  negotiating table to push Russia to that point.  Putin now hears from the American President and from the Europeans is that we will do whatever it takes for Ukraine to be as strong as possible when peace deal is taking place or peace negotiations will start to be in the best possible place at that moment. And then on top of that,  the threat of sanctions in 50 days on those who are still buying, like Brazil, India and China, from Russia. So if I was in the Kremlin today, I would not be too happy. Because this is a clear signal that President Trump is serious. He wants peace. He hates the fact that so many people lose their lives in Ukraine.  You mentioned the NATO political success for President Trump. The New York Times writes it this way. Since his first term, Mr. Trump has been pressing for the Allies to spend more on their own defense. After one day meeting in the Netherlands, they agreed to raise their spending on the military to 5% of their national income by 2035. The amount consists of 3.5% on traditional military needs, like troops, weapons, shells, and missiles, up sharply from the current target  of 2%. I mean, describe that for the layperson in America, how big a deal that is, that shift. It really started in the first term with President Trump, but now in this moment. The direct impact, if I was living in America, is more jobs for the middle class. Because this will mean more production lines, more shifts in the great defense industrial base here in the US. Of course, the same in Europe, because we need the defense industrial base across the alliance, from Turkey up to and including California. Well, it will mean more jobs for the middle class in the US.  President Trump was pushing Europeans to get to this famous 2% which was the old target at the beginning of this year. Seven, eight countries were still not on that 2% and they all came in before the summit in The Hague. Spain was not there. Also Spain committed to the 2%.  But now 5% is a little too much for them. They are saying we can get there on a lower percentage. Absolutely not true. They will not be able to do that. They will need to spend the 5%. But OK, we said you show us you can do it for a smaller amount of money, but you will never be able to do that. That's clear. But all 32% have committed to this 5% and to their target.  I think one of the biggest foreign policy successes of President Trump. And it also means that NATO is reinvigorated because it is fairer, we spend the same as the Americans are spending on the European side, and we need it to keep ourselves safe from Russia, which is investing in its defence at a staggering rate.  You said that the US is not secure if the Atlantic, Europe, and the Arctic are not secured. There's an increasing realization, and let's not be naive about it, if Xi Jinping would attack Taiwan, he would first make sure that he makes a call to his very junior partner in all of this, Vladimir Putin, residing in Moscow, and telling him, hey, I'm going to do this, and I need you to keep them busy in Europe by attacking NATO territory. So you see this all linked.  together. And most policy experts see this all linked. Because there was always the thinking the Chinese might attack Taiwan as a sort of isolated incident, which is, by the way, of course, big enough by itself. But it is clear that China is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine together with North Korea and Iran. So this is North Korea, China, Iran working together with the Russians.  And China is doing that for a reason. It gives them leverage over, indeed, their very junior partner, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. And clearly, if they would move on Taiwan, they will force Putin to move on Europe. And for the U.S., NATO is there because, of course, you want Europe to be safe, but in the first place, also, because the U.S. has to stay safe. And therefore, you need a safe and secure Atlantic, Arctic, and Europe. How is President Trump seen around the world by world leaders you deal with?  I think he is very well respected. And I saw in The Hague, at the summit, 31 leaders. So the 32nd, of course, is the US. In itself, by the way, bigger than all the other 31 combined. That is how powerful this country is and this nation is in your military. But the other 31 leaders really recognizing, hey, this is somebody who is absolutely clear what he wants to achieve, is committed to NATO, but he is extremely frustrated about the fact that we are not paying up. And now we are paying up. And therefore, this commitment to NATO is ironclad.  You raised some eyebrows when you used the term daddy."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 467.99, "text": "Yeah."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 468.11, "text": "I probably should have said father or the grown-up in the room.

So he laughed about it. He laughs about it. And that is why I like him so much, because he has that humor and that light touch. And he's a great man. Mr. Secretary General, thanks for the time. Thank you so much. Good to be in the show.  We just watched major, major policy shift from President Trump, who spoke live from the Oval Office, joined by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The president announced he will be allowing Ukraine to purchase more American weapons, including Patriot defense missiles.  And the president tore into Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said, quote, he's very unhappy with Putin and threatened 100% tariffs on Russia if the peace deal is not agreed upon within 50 days. When asked 50 days, why that long? He said, it's really not a long time. I mean, think about it. 100% tariffs could be coming.  They could not sustain that with that economy. This is Outnumbered. I'm Harris Faulkner, here with my co-host, Emily Campagno. Also joining us today, Lisa Booth, Fox News political analyst, Alicia Acuna from the West Coast, Fox News senior correspondent, and Paul Morrow, Fox News contributor, attorney, and retired NYPD inspector and attorney. All right, so Alicia, we look at the situation. We've been covering this for 1,220 days.  So the idea of Ukraine getting crushed and needing more is not specifically new, but President Trump ran in part on saying he would end this. It's 157 days. It's not that long into his presidency, and he's given an ultimatum to a man he once described as having a good relationship with.  Yes, absolutely. And I also find it interesting, and Jackie Heinrich hit on this, that he said it didn't matter to him that the Senate, while it's doing its job and it's doing a good job considering the 500% tariffs on countries that do deals with Russia, right? He's got his own deal going on as well, with 100% tariffs on the table in 50 days. He made it very clear, we're going to hit them and we're going to hit them hard. Some of it's going to come from me, some of it could come from the Senate. But either way, you are dealing with me now.  And he also made it incredibly clear that you are no longer dealing with President Biden. Right. I think it's also important, Paul, that we not pay for this. And that seems to be critical because the president hit that point hard. Let's watch. I am with Russia, but we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with him and we're going to be  doing very severe tariffs. If we don't have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100 percent. You'd call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine. And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it.  And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin, because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago. But it doesn't seem to get there. Paul, $350 billion the U.S. has already spent on this war. And so he's saying no. You guys ponied up for your percentages at the G7 summit recently. That's how they'll get paid for."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 689.594, "text": " This is where Donald Trump's straight-talking rail politic really hits the ground, and it's something he doesn't get a lot of credit for, because the foreign policy intelligentsia, this is all ironed out on the campuses and among the academics, all the think tanks, and they see Donald Trump as some sort of unwashed, uneducated character or something because he doesn't speak their language. Why? Because he speaks plainly and he goes right to the truth. Trump is the first guy that we've seen relative to the Soviet Union, which is what Putin wants to reconstitute.  He's the first guy who's taken NATO back to first principles, which is, we're all in this together, guys. And we're not going to pony up all the money for all of the defense. We've created in Europe a series of defense junkies. And they're all sitting around. I've been over there. Wow.  They're sitting around saying, don't worry about it, guys. It's OK. Because you know what? America will send the 82nd Airborne, and we'll get out of this. Take the money and put it into whatever. And very clearly, that's gone away. And you have to say to yourself, where were our NATO ambassadors all of this time? Did nobody come back?  from Europe come back from The Hague and say, Mr. President, I've got to tell you something. They're all deadbeats. They won't even put up the 2% that they're supposed to put up. You mean with the last administration? Going back even further, the German politicians literally laughed at Donald Trump first time around when he said, you're going to all be beholden to Russian  oil. As far as the tariffs go, one thing I would just say we have to be cautious about. Russia loves to say we can survive anything with self-sufficient. They'll sacrifice a whole generation over there. And they are, right now, a wartime economy. A lot of people fear that if this gets resolved, he'll start another war just to keep his economy going. So right now, the Georgians, the people in the Baltics, they're all very concerned about the fact that if you end this one, we may have another one."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 795.029, "text": " So that's really interesting, Emily, because he doesn't share a border with Germany, but he's across the Baltic Sea from Germany. And the president just said, the country that is talking so strongly about what would happen if Russia doesn't come to a deal and back down is Germany. He said, I won't tell you what we would do, but they're very bold about what they would do. And I wonder if it's not that Baltic proximity that has Germany going, we're also the ones with the most weaponry.  weaponry, rather, so on and so forth. What's your take? Yeah, I think that's why we sort of saw today the signal of this, like, hard-lined renaissance happening in the approach, and the whole point is that this is going to test the allied cohesion, indeed, absolutely that, and then the real impact of economic pressure.  To that point, will it actually work, or will Putin just spin out and start other wars? I thought what was interesting is that as we tip into this next phase, so we have military support for Ukraine. It's structured around financial accountability, and then the stick is sanctions. But the whole point is we're going to see the barriers along the way, the challenges. Do the allies have budgets? Germany has said, we are going to spend a lot.  At a certain point, there's obviously a finite end. Will the tariff timeline hold? Diplomacy with Russia may falter under inflexibility, obviously, because look at what Trump mentioned. We talk on the phone, everything's cool, and then he goes ahead and bombs everyone. So there's not a lot of predictability with that model.  predict with any type of confidence what the other person's going to do. And then I think there might be domestic criticism in just that it might undermine global diplomacy, the argument goes, and then obviously with China weighing in. So I think this is a test, but I know I have my money on the president because he won't falter.  The wild card is Putin. So the politics of this, you know, I mean, what Emily's talking about is true. It's what's going on at home and potentially what kind of pressure that can put on a deal or the president. So we know the United Senate and House can put on their 500 percent tariffs on the countries that do business with Russia. And the president said, well, Senator John Thune's coming over and we're going to talk about that. Now, I assume he means to the White House.  coming over to his house right the people's house but on top of that he says I can do my own deal so that's what you were talking about Alicia and he said and I could put that up to a hundred percent so if if people can't afford to do business with them and they can't afford to do business with us where are they gonna get their stuff  Well, I also think it's smart politically for President Trump to remove us slightly from saying, look, NATO's going to buy these weapons and then distribute them. We're not doing it. And that's also where you see President Trump not just the commander in chief, but the business guy, right? He's always looking out for the bottom line of Americans, with they're going to buy these weapons, getting Ukraine to sign a minerals deal, getting NATO to pay more, increase their spending by 5%.  So we see the business guy in President Trump. Look, I have concerns similar to what Paul expressed about, is this war never ending with Russia and Ukraine? Will it ever end? Russia has a larger military. They have more people to sacrifice at the altar of this war. However, I think President Trump deserves our deference. He's always right. When has he been wrong about foreign policy? His naysayers are the ones. Everyone said there was going to be a World War III.  after, you know, sending those bombs to Iran and taking out some of their nuclear facilities, or at least badly damaging them, that didn't come to fruition, right? So he's repeatedly been... Or, you know, moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Everyone was worried about that, right? So everyone has been wrong. He's always been right. So he deserves our deference. And then also, this is a guy who's really interested in peace, as he pointed out, ending that 30-year war between Congo and Rwanda, which he doesn't get any credit for. So, you know, look, I'm gonna wait and see on this, but I think he has earned our respect.  And he's earned our deference, because he has repeatedly been right, and his naysayers are wrong. Well, look, in India and Pakistan, that we're ready to have a hot war. He ended that in a weekend. Look, real quickly, because I think this is worth knowing. Patriot missiles in certain countries as of 2022. So who else has these, right? So some of them are in NATO, some of them are not. The US, obviously, the Netherlands, which for 14 years, Ruda was their prime minister, so we know that.  We can get a good count on them there. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been going around and calculating where all these things are. Germany has them, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Bahrain, and Switzerland. Just to give an idea of where there are other Patriot missile systems, because that comes into play some of those countries in NATO.

They don't have any other leverage. We've eliminated that. Israel has destroyed Iran's proxy terrorist network, as well as their air defenses. And we have the upper hand. And I think that's why we're seeing this threat.  I expect President Trump to be working closely with law enforcement as well as the intelligence community just to learn more details about how serious this threat is. But again, we have to be very, very vigilant."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1190.36, "text": " It sounds like that is the case. U.S. Secret Service did pass along a statement to Fox, and it reads, in part, quote, we operate in a heightened and very dynamic threat environment, and the safety and security of the president and all of our protectees remains our highest priority. To preserve operational integrity, we can't comment on specific protective intelligence matters.  However, our teams work around the clock with international, federal, state, and local partners to ensure the highest levels of protection. But to your point, Dan, this was a senior State Department official, an official statement from the State Department on this as well, saying a senior State Department official is telling the Washington Free Beacon that the Trump administration is aware of these threats and committed to, quote, holding bad actors accountable. This means using  every tool at our disposal, including sanctions, to implement the president's maximum pressure strategy. We're learning about this blood covenant, Dan, obviously at the same time that President Trump says he's hopeful of a ceasefire in these talks between Israel and Hamas potentially happening this week.

You've got to go on offense. So it doesn't mean that the United States won't seek to disrupt these threats. And I'm sure that we're mounting a full court press to do just that. When it comes to an Israel deal with Hamas, it's possible. But Hamas wants Israel out of the Gaza Strip, and they want a permanent ceasefire. Israel's not willing to do that.  We also don't know what the Gaza Strip is going to look like, what the day after looks like. Israel wants to ensure that there could be no future terrorist threat emanating from Gaza against Israel. And so what I expect is it's possible, through very intense diplomacy from the Trump administration, that we may arrive at some middle ground where we have a short-term ceasefire for 30 or 60 days.  a prisoner exchange where Israel releases perhaps as many as 1,000 Palestinians in return for some of the hostages who are still alive."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1320.1, "text": "This also, before I let you go, as the administration seems to be cranking up pressure on Russia, teasing this major statement or announcement, Dan, today as these drone strikes hit Ukraine, I just want to roll this on President Trump earlier on how he will respond if Putin escalates.

Thank you so much, Dan. Let's bring in now the United States Ambassador to NATO, Matt Whitaker. Thank you very much, Matt, for being here. This was President Trump, more from him, Satwan guys, on this deal. This was in the Oval Office. You were there on this weapons deal to Ukraine. More details, listen.  We've made a deal today where we're going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. The United States will not be having any payment made. We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it and they're going to be paying for it. So what do you want people to know about this deal?  Well, I think it's very important to know, first of all, the days of the United States sending unlimited taxpayer dollars to defend Ukraine are over. President Trump has made a very smart decision, an agreement with NATO, which says  Europe and Canada will pay for the weapons. The United States will manufacture them. Obviously, we make the best weapons systems in the world, and everyone wants them. And we're going to prioritize those going to Ukraine. And what this says also to Vladimir Putin, I think, is very loud and clear, which is, you know, we've given you a chance for peace. President Trump is a peacemaker. But if you want war, we will arm Ukraine, and Europe will pay for it.  It's actually, I think, a great step in ultimately bringing this war to a conclusion, to an end. In the last 18 months, Russia has gained about 1% of Ukrainian land. I mean, they're making no success. They're losing thousands of soldiers every single day. And way too many private citizens in Ukraine and the big cities are being injured. So I think this is a great next step  and finally ending this war. But again, if Vladimir Putin wants to continue to fight on the battlefields of Ukraine, the United States of America will sell Europe armaments so that they can be used by Ukraine to defend themselves. Matt, like his predecessor, Jens Stoltenberg, Mark Rutte appears to be a big fan of the president. Here's what he said after the announcement.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia. But you don't want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit.  I mean, this changes the status quo quite dramatically. It used to be that the Europeans would like to have Ukraine have weapons, but they were very happy to have the United States pay for it. Now they're ponying up for it. So that's different. But how also do you think Putin's going to react to this?  Well obviously he's going to react to not only the United States weapons being readily available to the Ukrainians at Europe's expense. He's also going to respond obviously to this tariff and especially as the people that are enabling of China India and others that are buying his oil. But you know this is a natural progression of what we did in the Hague at the NATO summit too. You know we obviously we  We move the burden off the American taxpayer for European defense and on to European taxpayers, where it should be. And the traditional defense of Europe is now going to be borne by the European population. And at the same time, we're doing the same thing with the Ukrainian war. You know, President Trump said today $350 billion of American taxpayers' money has gone to support Ukraine. No longer. But at the same time, we're not cutting them off from weapons, and we're also  also not making the United States of America less secure. We're going to make sure that strategically we have enough that we need and then anything else that we can make, manufacture and sell to our European allies and give to Ukraine I think is a perfect and elegant solution for this.  And now there's this idea of secondary tariffs, 50-day deadline. This may be the leverage that President Trump thinks he has with Vladimir Putin in Russia. And to John's point about this relationship with the NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, President Trump has spoken very highly of their relationship in the past. Here's just more of a sampling from the Oval Office, an exchange on this war, and it just keeps going on and on. Listen.  I felt, I don't know about you, Mark, but I felt that we had a deal about four times. And here we are, still talking about it. And he didn't send serious people to the negotiations. We thought, and I thought, we should have had a deal done a long time ago. But it just keeps going on and on.  Feel free to weigh in on that, Matt, but also having been in that Oval Office when all of this was going down, how important is it that they really seem to have developed a very strong relationship, the two of them?  Yeah, and obviously, Secretary, General Secretary Rutte is a very good politician. He was 14 years as the Dutch prime minister, and he knows how European politics works, and he can obviously bring people to the table in Europe. Obviously, President Trump is the master dealmaker, and I think he saw an opportunity here to not only, you know, bring jobs to middle America through making weapons systems. You know, I've seen some of those manufacturing  the U.S.  And I look, you know, every day that I work with him is enjoyable because he's such a professional and he is equally working hard to make NATO strong and make, most importantly, Europe strong. Because President Trump said it today when we were talking to him. And that is, is that a Europe, a strong Europe, a Europe that can deter Russia, frees up the United States to address all of our strategic concerns across the globe. And that's a good thing for everyone.  I mean, it is so interesting to see opponents of the president whining about him, insisting that NATO nations pony up and do their share. But the people who seem to like it are the people who are running NATO. Matt, great to catch up with you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Matt. Thank you. Meantime, senior White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich was at today's event in the Oval Office. She starts us off inside the White House briefing room. Good evening, Jackie.  Good evening, Brett. The president, who sharply criticized past assistance to Ukraine, often calling Zelensky a salesman, insulated himself from criticism over this policy shift, emphasizing that he's authorizing the sale of U.S. weapons to NATO allies, whose leaders he also praised after they stepped up their defense commitments. We had a deal about four times.  President Trump is stepping up Ukraine's defenses with billions of dollars worth of US weapons bought and distributed by NATO allies. Trump now fed up with Putin's games. My conversations with him are always very pleasant. When I tell the first lady, you know, I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation. She said, oh, really?  Another city was just hit. So it's like, look, he's, I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. Trump also giving Putin 50 days to reach a deal or face 100% secondary sanctions on any country doing business with Russia, a hefty consequence for major purchasers of Russian oil like China and India. The package is separate from the 500% secondary sanctions leaders in the Senate and House have been withholding for Trump's green light.  I'm not sure we need it, but it's certainly good that they're doing it. And I think they've actually crafted a pretty good piece of legislation that's probably going to pass very easily, and that includes Democrats. The president said Ukraine should begin receiving Patriot missile systems within days, replacements now heading to NATO countries as soon as this afternoon, a major development after the Pentagon briefly paused arms deliveries for a stockpile review early this month, an apparent surprise to the president. So who ordered the pause last week?  I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Trump indicated today this impending deal played a role. I knew what Pete was doing was evaluation because we knew this was going to happen. Obviously, that has a big impact on, you know, when you say a pause. Obviously, you're not going to be doing things if you don't know what's going to happen here. But we were pretty sure this was going to happen, so we did a little bit of a pause.  A White House official tells Fox the president ordered a review of U.S. stockpiles following the Iran strikes, and Pentagon officials believed that they were adhering to the president's wishes when they paused those arms deliveries for the purposes of that review, but there was no broader policy decision to pause military aid to Ukraine. Brett.  Jack Hanrak, live in the White House Briefing Room. Jackie, thank you. You think that the sanctions on other countries doing deals with Russia will create additional pressure, exponential? Absolutely. This is significant. So today, if you are in Beijing, or in Delhi, or you're in Brazil, and you know that this is coming to you, you might want to call Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and say, hey, friend, we are still buying stuff from you. But you have got to get serious when it comes to these negotiations on a ceasefire or a peace deal. Or otherwise, we get hit.  by the secondary sanctions.  President Trump stepping up the pressure there. You see the NATO Secretary General on set. Axios writes it this way, Trump to supply missiles to Ukraine gives Russia a 50-day ultimatum. This is a seismic policy shift from President Trump, who originally refused to side with Ukraine and until very recently insisted he would only supply defensive weapons so as not to escalate the war. Trump also said he was giving Russia 50 days to make a deal or else face 100% secondary tariffs, seemingly referring to a plan to impose tariffs on countries like China and India.  that by Russian oil, that would have a major impact on global oil markets. With that, let's bring in our panel, Fox News contributor Mary Catherine Hamm, Dasha Burns, White House Bureau Chief for Politico, and Guy Benson, also a Fox News contributor. All right, Mary Catherine, seems like it is a big turning point and may make a big difference.  Yeah, I went back to 2018 actually to reflect on how we got here when Trump first went to NATO and five countries were committing 2% at that point. And now you've got this big shift that the Secretary General noted with everybody but Spain saying we can get to 5%. And I think that's interesting because I was a person who back then thought, was worried about his rhetoric on NATO and who still worries about his rhetoric on Ukraine and Russia. But he has created a situation where he can do this deal that puts pressure on  Putin, because I think he feels like he's been worked over a little bit in that area. And he can do it in a way that is politically fine for him to do, even with his base, because Europe is paying for it, and strategically helpful to Ukraine, which is what I'm looking for. Yeah. Dasha, it is a change for this White House in positioning. And the question is, what happens after the 50 days? Does he agree to this Lindsey Graham bipartisan bill to put the pressure on, or does he do it himself?  Well, I just spoke to a senior White House official about just that, Brett. And the point here is I asked whether the shift was due to something. Did Putin say something? Did something happen? And they said, no, look, it's just time. And Russia at this point is now committing some of the worst atrocities against civilians of this entire war. And Trump feels like he's been tapped along by Putin. At the same time, Trump does feel like  Putin is the bigger fish with the upper hand here, and so he doesn't want to go full blunt force trauma against Russia right away, which is why we've really seen him hedge on this idea of sanctions. What I know is behind the scenes, the White House is very much in contact with Lindsey Graham about this, but they want the language change to give Trump the ultimate say, to give him the maximum optionality so that it's on the table, he can threaten Putin with it, but if Putin comes to the negotiating table in full good faith, then maybe it's a different story.  You know, the NATO Secretary General said the president gave Putin chances on multiple phone calls, but then noticed the attacks that came right after those phone calls as an affront to him and to the thought that he's going to get to the table. And he, frankly, was angry about it."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2156.283, "text": "Yeah. I think the NATO chief, to make this point, is very good. He's very smooth and not in a smarmy way.

Especially when you think about elitists in Europe, right? The default setting has been vis-a-vis President Trump. Smug, condescension, sneering. And the NATO chief, the Secretary General, has completely rejected that, and wouldn't you  Wouldn't you guess it?

There's a MAGA rebellion over the Epstein outcry. The split over Epstein represents one of the biggest rifts within the Trump supporters since the president took office for a second term. On one side are MAGA supporters who push claims that Epstein was murdered in his jail cell and that the disgraced financier had kept a list of high-profile clients. But Trump's DOJ and FBI have concluded that there's no evidence for either. Mary Catherine.  Yeah, I think there's a couple things going on here. Many, many, many people look at this and go, on its face, it looks like it was handled at least incompetently, if not corruptly, from day one, regardless of leadership. And they want answers because there are real victims who we will probably never know much about because they signed NDAs and because very powerful people were involved.  And also, there was an easy answer for the Trump administration here, which was, Ghislaine Maxwell is appealing. We cannot release anything while that is ongoing, right? I think that would have been the clean answer. Now they're in this situation where a bunch of people are deeply invested in this particular story, which there may be plenty more to, as a decoder ring for all that is corrupt in government. And if they don't get answers on that, they'll be very mad. Here's the other thing, though. There's a large portion of that portion of the base that will listen to Trump when they give him, when he gives them an answer on this.  And the question is, how politically salient is that? And does he have the benefit of the doubt?  Here's the tension. The White House wants to move on from this. One senior official tells me that they understand it's important to the base, and that doesn't mean they're going to ignore it, but they want to move past it. They also feel like this is very much an online kind of outrage, not that the issue is not important to the base, but that the outcry and the rage factor is very much an online thing led by these influencers. But the reality of it is that the people in Middle America that voted for Trump  are not as invested in this as they are in the economy and health care. The other piece of it is, the more that this administration doesn't want to talk about this, the more that online group wants to talk about it and shout about it and feels like there's more of a there there.

If Mr. Hockman's office wanted to cut right to ultimate justice in this case, it would be, you know, agreeing that these boys should have initially been able to present a manslaughter conviction to the jury, which wasn't allowed. And that's the crux of the prima facie case here in the habeas.  What the determination that Judge Ryan needs to make is, is there evidence that either wasn't available at the time that should have gone to the jury that would have changed their verdict? And what Mr. Hockman has wrong is that Leslie Abramson always, as part of her defense in this case, always argued that it was imperfect self-defense.  that yes, the brothers killed their parents because they thought they were going to be killed, but an imperfect self-defense allows the jury to understand that they might have been wrong. Even though they were wrong in believing that they were going to be killed, they still believed it.  And if they believed it and were wrong, it's not a complete self-defense, but it does lower the conviction from a murder to a manslaughter. And in their second trial, they were not allowed, the jury was not allowed to consider the manslaughter, they were not allowed to consider the imperfect self-defense.  So, the way that the sexual abuse plays into that is that because of the abuse by their parents, because of the father's sexual abuse and because of their mother sanctioning this abuse, creating this hallway rule where adults and family members were not allowed to go down the hallway if one of the children was in the room with Jose, this terrible, terrible thing that both of these parents did, because of that abuse,  Psychologically, these children were in fear of these parents and believed, even if it may have been incorrect on that day, that these parents were going to kill them and that the only way out was to kill them themselves. That is an imperfect self-defense. It wasn't allowed to go to the jury.

It might be we charge a very discount rate for this purpose as well. That's very possible. There is a lot of latitude on what we can charge for weapons, and certainly if it's something we have in the inventory, what we can charge. But this is actually kind of going back to something we've heard from President Trump and those around him for quite some time, is that the European countries need to start pulling their weight and providing more support for NATO.  What this does is it addresses a defense industrial base shortfall within Europe. I'm not saying the U.S. is healthy in this regard. We have a lot of work to do to rebuild our defense industrial base, but Europe is much further behind us. So they're not in a position where they can suddenly start producing weapons at the rate to support Ukraine with what Ukraine needs. So now it's okay.

Now, the thing they just announced, this is new.  This will be on top of whatever that is. And I will say the Europeans have been stepping up really fast. In fact, I saw an estimate some weeks back that said they'd actually filled the gap in terms of contribution towards buying weapons for Ukraine that the U.S. used to fill.  And so that was pretty big. But this actually addresses that other problem, which is how do you get the weapons?

Basically, what this would do is potentially shut that whole thing down, and that would cause a massive crunch in revenue going to Russia. Russia is, to use the late Senator John McCain's expression, is basically a big gas station. They are a petrostate.  And they are running out of places they can sell their oil.

And something that's very interesting is that Biden's use of the auto pen stems far back into the early days of his presidency, whenever he was signing proclamations at first. It really wasn't until, I believe, the first year of his presidency, I believe on a trip to Israel where he used the auto pen  kind of as it is usually intended for, which is to sign legislation while you're away from the office. But as it turns out, we began to see later into Biden's presidency, there were days whenever he was even at the White House,  where he was having the auto pen being signed. That's according to information that's been obtained and released from the Oversight Project, formerly part of the Heritage Foundation, but they uncovered on at least seven different occasions. There were times whenever Biden was working at the Oval Office, but he still had things signed with auto pen. Therein lies where Republicans start to get suspicious because they think to themselves, kind of like we were just mentioning before, if it's supposed to be something that is convenient and for ease,  Well, one can make also an argument that it's just as easy to use your own hand to sign a signature on something, especially if you're at work that day. So I think that that's where people start, especially Republicans, start to look at the issue and wonder to themselves, was there something else happening here? Were there more aides that were doing this, perhaps unbeknownst to the president? And I think that that's where, especially Republicans like, say in Comer's camp,  want to see the Justice Department look into this as well. And I'll say this, you know, last week, whenever we saw Biden's doctor plead the fifth, there was a bit of a discussion about whether I remember Mike Lee, Senator Mike Lee from Utah was asking, why don't we just give Biden's doctor immunity if he's going to plead the fifth?

The AC units blocked the largest windows of this residency and therefore some of the most critical exit points. So as you heard from Lorraine, in some cases, firefighters had to smash the smaller windows in order to pull people out of those of those windows. The firefighter union tonight saying that if they have been adequately staffed, better staff than more lives, Tom could have been saved.  Yeah, and I want to ask you about some of the survivors you talked to, because you really sort of were able to tell their story of how they survived. How are those folks doing? Because they live in that facility. They obviously need help. I can't imagine what they're going through.  Yeah, Tom. So they have been displaced from their home.

OK, Emily Aketa leading us off here in Top Story tonight.

OK, we want to head to Texas now, where there are new concerns as heavy rains threaten to bring more flooding to the areas hardest hit by those recent deadly storms. This as new reporting reveals details about the response to the floods at Camp Mystic, where dozens tragically lost their life. NBC's Morgan Chesky has more.  Tonight, dangerous downpours threatening the Texas Hill Country, with flood watches covering areas in recovery mode. The death toll statewide from the flooding, now more than 130 people, as new details emerge about the crucial moments the waters rose.  at 1.14 a.m. on July 4th. A family spokesman tells NBC News Dick Eastland, the owner of Camp Mystic, received a National Weather Service alert on his cell phone. The spokesman says Eastland then walked outside to assess the property, called family on walkie-talkies, and between 2 and 2.30 a.m., staff began moving campers to the Mystic Rec Hall. Eastland later died in the floods.  Following the tragic loss of life, growing scrutiny over the lack of warnings from officials, who are the only ones able to tell residents to evacuate or shelter in place. It wasn't like a tornado. It wasn't like a hurricane even. It lasted all day. We asked Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice on who has authority to issue alerts at a city level.  What person would that be? So ultimately, it's me. Ultimately, I have the ultimate authority to be able to make those decisions based on that. Rice adding he was managing rescues and says other local officials can also blast out citywide warnings. Did you issue one? Yeah. So I did not. But that does not mean that something did or did not get issued. I don't know. We haven't dove into looking at the after action stuff. Officials say full reviews are still coming. Until then, the search for the missing, now in its second week.  These divers clearing off debris above before scouring the murky depths below. A painstaking process for closure that may never come. And Morgan joins us tonight live from Kerrville, Texas. Morgan, what do those flood warnings tonight mean for the search and recovery effort?  Yeah, Tom, well, authorities have said that volunteers needed to vacate this river area because the levels are still high. They're telling all of those individuals to stay on higher ground. But as for the search and rescue crews or recovery crews, unfortunately, you can see they are still absolutely in this river, even though that there are hazards beneath the water here, Tom. They have been scouring this stretch of the riverbank here on the Guadalupe. And unfortunately, Tom, with more rain in the forecast, that could pose an issue for them.  But just a testament to their tireless work. And you have yet another helicopter flying up above us. Tom, it feels like this has really been a nonstop effort since this flood began, now 11 days ago here. Unfortunately, that number missing, not dropping as fast as families would like. But the one thing we continue to hear from these crews that are out on this river every single day is they're going to stay here as long as it takes to try to make that closure happen here. Tom?  All right, Morgan Chesky for us. Morgan, we thank you for that. I want to get right over to NBC New York meteorologist Violeta Yaas, who joins us tonight here on Top Stories. So it has been relentless for parts of Texas right now, and millions across the East Coast are at risk for flash floods. What are you tracking tonight?  It has been a very rough rush hour across the northeastern U.S. with torrential, slow-moving downpours now advancing across that I-95 corridor. You can see numerous flash flood warnings in effect. We're seeing not only that, but we've got flood watches in effect through this evening, impacting 46 million people. You can see that really includes that whole I-95 corridor. So we've been seeing this all afternoon long.  This is going to be the focus through the next couple of hours. It's not just the amount of rain, but the fact that these thunderstorms are very slow moving in a very densely populated area of the country, the most densely populated area. So this has been causing big issues as delays have been piling up here across some of our major airports, D.C., Baltimore, up through Philadelphia, Newark, LaGuardia and JFK as well. So very stormy afternoon.  We can expect potentially significant flooding here. That's going to be the bullseye area, unfortunately, from D.C. up through Philadelphia into the New York City area as well. In terms of how much rain we're talking, you can see a general injure or so, but locally in some of those heavier downpours.  We're talking totals on the order of three to five inches of rain, certainly enough to cause flooding, especially when you're talking about a short period of time. So expect very difficult travel here through the next several hours. It's certainly a situation where if you don't need to be heading out the door, you definitely don't want to do that. So very unsettled weather here through this evening, very heavy downpours in the forecast here, really through tonight before conditions start to improve as we head into tomorrow.  All right, Violeta, let's talk about the Gulf now and what's happening just off the east coast of Florida, but why we're tracking it tonight.  Yeah, I actually do have an update for you. We now have tropical disturbance at 93 L invest that essentially formalizes this as an area that we're going to be watching. Still hasn't developed into a tropical storm or anything like that, but conditions are going to be favorable through the next couple of days. So this is going to be tracking across Florida into the Gulf the next couple of days. So if it does intensify, this would become Dexter through the remainder of this week.  Now, the rainfall totals here, you can see on the order of three to five inches locally, even more from parts of central and southern Florida, extending right through the panhandle into the remainder of the Gulf States. So this is an area that does need to be on alert through the next couple of days. Is there enough room, enough time for this to sort of develop into something potentially deadly?  We do have some time for this to intensify. It's possible. It doesn't necessarily do so before tracking across Florida. But once this moves into the Gulf and we've seen this time and time again, those very warm water temperatures, conditions are favorable in this particular area for that intensification. So we'll need to watch out for that. But another thing we've seen through the last several years is that you don't want to get too hung up on the exact categorization because this is going to provide  very heavy rainfall, and the potential for flooding in all of these areas, regardless of whether or not it does formally intensify into a tropical storm eventually. All right, Violeta, yes, we thank you so much for being here tonight. In Washington, President Trump announcing a new plan to rearm Ukraine as Russia intensifies its attacks on the country.

Maggie joins us now live. Maggie, a couple questions for you. First, you mentioned that state trooper who was shot and injured. And then I was also thinking about what you just reported there at the end. How did he get all these weapons if he had these prior convictions? Tom, we know of one possibility. We talked about that protective order that reportedly an ex-girlfriend just filed here earlier this month. In it, she wrote, among the other factors that kind of tie to his escalating behavior, she said that he had broken into her home and stolen her guns  plural. Now, police were asked today whether or not they knew or could say whether where he got his weapons and they declined to do so.

All right, still ahead right here on Top Story, a dangerous and growing trend. Four kids busted for this in New York City subway surfing. Two of them just 12 years old. What happened to them when police caught up to them?  Plus, unreleased Beyonce music stolen during her Cowboy Carter tour, thieves breaking into an SUV, making off with unreleased music, concert plans, and more. But first, tonight, top stories, top moment, and one unexpected pizza delivery. Police in Tempe, Arizona say they arrested a delivery driver during a traffic stop. What happened next came as a shock to the customer waiting for her food. Take a look.  Yeah, the Grubhub delivery driver apparently arrested, bringing a whole new meaning to what these officers did, and that is to protect and serve. Get it? Okay, stay with us. We are back in just a moment.  Back now with Top Stories news feed. The Supreme Court today said President Donald Trump may proceed with his plans to carry out mass layoffs at the Department of Education in the latest win for the White House. The justice is lifting a lower court ruling that put an indefinite pause on Trump's plan while legal challenges play out.  Trump ordered mass layoffs at the department earlier this year, cutting its workforce in half. But lower courts have blocked that effort, noting that the education department was created by Congress in a scathing dissent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision, quote, indefensible. Here in New York City, four kids were spotted by police drones riding on top of train cars. It's a dangerous trend known as subway surfing. Two of the boys were only 12 years old.  hard to believe. Police boarded the train and all four kids were taken into custody. The incident comes after a 15-year-old boy was killed on July 4th while subway surfing. Police and MTA officials believe the practice has increased in recent years due to social media urging people not to glamorize it. Former Major League Baseball player Dan Serafini has been found guilty  of murdering his father-in-law and trying to murder his mother-in-law after a 2021 Tahoe area home ambush and shooting. The motive, according to the prosecution, was rooted in longstanding family tensions and financial disputes. Key testimony came from Serafini's wife, Erin Spore, who said she didn't believe the family's disagreements could lead her husband to commit murder. In addition to murder and attempted murder, Serafini was found guilty of first-degree burglary. His sentencing set for August 18th.  And police in Richmond Heights, Ohio, capturing the moment three women twerked on a cop cruiser, then using a facial recognition platform, they identified them. Take a look at this. So dash cam video shows a woman climbing onto the car with others. Later joining police say the brazen act, which involved this type of dancing you see here, happened back in June. It damaged the vehicles because of that twerking with dents and scratches. A detective telling us with the use of Clearview AI facial recognition, they were able to identify  to identify two of the women who were twerking. Warrants are out for their arrest. They're still searching for a third. Okay, and a paraglider making it out unscathed after a run-in with a power line in North Dakota. This is pretty incredible. The paraglider flying steadily until you see this coming in close with those power lines, setting off the sparks, then plunges into the Red River. Crews are able to rescue the paraglider, helping him to get to shore. Thankfully, he was unharmed. Incredible he survived that. Okay, to Atlanta now in a major theft.  music world. Atlanta police say hard drives containing unreleased Beyonce music were stolen during a car break-in last week. The hard drives also included footage plans for Queen B's show and future set lists. For more on this, I want to bring in NBC's Priscilla Thompson, a proud member of the Beehive. Priscilla, thank you for this. So talk to us more about the break-in. I mean, this could be pretty huge, especially if it is all of Beyonce's stuff and they end up putting it somewhere on the Internet.  Yeah, Tom, incredibly huge, especially for such a high profile celebrity as Beyonce. We have obtained the incident report that shows that this happened last Tuesday, just as she was kicking off her Atlanta leg of the Cowboy Carter tour. And it happened at Crog Street Market, which is this very popular food hall in Atlanta. Now, according to Beyonce's choreographer, Christopher Grant, and also a dancer, D'Andre Bleu, they pulled into this market at around eight o'clock at night  An hour later, they went out to the car, and they noticed that the window towards the trunk was damaged. And they found that two suitcases were missing. And inside those suitcases were hard drives that contained watermarked music, unreleased music, footage plans for past and future shows, and also set lists.  We know that in addition to all of those very important things to Beyonce, I'm sure there were also laptops, headphones, different kinds of electronics. So lots of questions about why that would have been left in a vehicle in a parking garage, but definitely not something that such a high profile celebrity would want to fall into the wrong hands. Yeah, no, I hear you. And Priscilla, do we think this was random or do we think that they were targeted, like they knew these people worked for Beyonce?  That is definitely the big question. Now, police have not said whether it was random or targeted. But what is interesting that, you know, a lot of folks have the Find My app that connects all of their Apple electronics. And so police were actually able to ping the headphones and the computers, and they sent out, like, multiple units to this area. We know that they interviewed a man in this area and that they were also looking at a vehicle that appeared to be moving as the items that they were tracking were also moving.  And what's more, there is video, police say, that this parking garage had video cameras. The entire incident was caught on video. We know that they took fingerprints at the garage. And police have said that they have issued a warrant for the arrest of the suspect. But they say that an I.D. is, quote, not yet available for release. So unclear if they have that identity and just aren't releasing it to the public yet. But, obviously, it comes as Beyonce is  probably about to take the stage any minute now for her final concert in Atlanta before the tour moves on. Tom? Yep. All right, Priscilla Thompson, we appreciate that reporting. Next tonight to Tesla's new legal battle over its autopilot driving system. A 2019 Florida case where a woman was killed when a Tesla crashed into her parked car, now at the center of a federal trial. The jury seated today must decide if the company bears responsibility for the fatal accident. NBC's George Solis has some of the details.  Tonight, Tesla on trial. In a first for Elon Musk's electric car company, Tesla will now have to defend itself before a federal jury against claims its driver assistance technology is to blame for a deadly 2019 crash in the Florida Keys. Those fateful moments caught on the Tesla's own cameras. In a lawsuit brought by the victim's family, the plaintiff's attorneys say the driver was using the electric car's autopilot, which failed to detect the substantial profile of the Chevy SUV parked at an intersection.  It goes on to say the vehicle struck the Tahoe at almost 70 miles per hour, causing it to violently rotate. The resulting collision claiming the life of 22 year old Nybel Benavides-Leon."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 47, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1910.611, "text": "Next thing that we knew was the police coming five in the morning just saying, you know, you little girl is not going to come home anymore."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 48, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1920.064, "text": "And seriously injuring her boyfriend, Dylan Angulo. I woke up in the hospital.  and I didn't know what happened to me. The aftermath also captured on police body cameras. The Tesla's driver admitting to taking his eyes off the road moments before the crash as he searched for his phone, according to court documents. The core of the case centering on whether Tesla is liable when its autopilot tech is involved in a crash and how it was marketed to drivers, according to the lawsuit.  In 2016, the company posting this video of a Tesla appearing to drive itself. The text on screen reading, the person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself. Today, the company warns that autopilot is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel. Tesla has denied responsibility for the 2019 crash. In a statement to NBC News, Tesla says in part, the crash had nothing to do with Tesla's autopilot technology,  Instead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cell phones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver. Tesla's autopilot system has faced legal challenges as recent as last year. In three separate California cases, Tesla either settled or was found not liable. Getting into the robo-taxi. The outcome could not only threaten Tesla's reputation, but also impact its self-driving footprint as it begins a push for robo-taxis nationally. Musk himself did not appear in the courtroom today.  All right, with that, George Solis joins us tonight from Miami. So, George, the jury already seated today. What do we know about the makeup of the jury, and how long do we expect this trial involving Tesla to last? Yeah, Tom, the jury was just elected in a couple of hours. It's made up of six women and three men, and some of them were weeded out during some of the questioning, saying they couldn't participate because of their feelings about Elon Musk. Others saying they were just supporters of Tesla and Elon. Now, this whole trial is expected to take about three weeks.  Tom. All right, George Solis first. George, thank you. Back here in New York City, a major announcement in the race for mayor. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announcing he's still in the race after losing the Democratic primary, saying he will compete as a third party candidate in this November's general election. Cuomo releasing this video on X, making it official."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 49, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2054.478, "text": " As my grandfather used to say, when you get knocked down, learn the lesson and pick yourself back up and get in the game. And that is what I'm going to do. The fight to save our city isn't over. Only 13% of New Yorkers voted in the June primary. The general election is in November, and I am in it to win it."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 50, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2075.268, "text": " All right, to break down what this means for the mayor's race, I'm joined tonight by Kevin Fry, Washington correspondent at New York One. Kevin, thanks so much for being here. So Kevin, Cuomo just quoted his grandfather, learn the lesson, pick yourself up, and get back in the game. But he lost by double digits in the primary, so what lesson did he learn here?  It seems some of it comes down to tactics. Cuomo ran during this primary campaign what could be likened to essentially a Rose Garden strategy. Even though he wasn't the incumbent, he was certainly running as the former governor with basically universal name ID, whereas Zoran Mamdani was very much on the ground. It was a tactical campaign. He was out interacting with the public. And today in that video and in a statement that Cuomo sent out to his supporters, he basically said that he was not aggressive enough  in that early campaign. And so he seems to be trying to take on a different approach. The other thing that was notable in the comments that he made in that video is he talked about affordability, which was really the hallmark of the Mamdani campaign. It wasn't necessarily something that Cuomo made front and center of his. So is he adopting some of that language? That seems to be somewhat of the approach here.  Does he have a point, though? I mean, if only 12% of the voting electorate participated in that primary election, I mean, is there a chance? He's got a chance.  I mean, he comes in as basically the most well-known man in New York City, arguably, though Mamdani, if you look at some of the preliminary polling, and it's very preliminary, still has the edge here. The major foil for Cuomo is that he is seemingly fighting for the same pool of voters as some of the other unaffiliated candidates or third-party candidates that are in this race, including the sitting mayor, Eric Adams.  as well as a Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa. And so if they're all fighting for the same piece of the pie, that does give Mamdani, it seems, again, preliminary polling, but does give him certainly a lane where he can kind of fight for his own way to win this. And if you have so many candidates, you don't have to get 50% to win, you just need to have the most.  Yeah, let's talk about a controversy involving Mamdani right now. He's facing the past few weeks. He has said previously that he doesn't consider himself black or African-American, despite being born in Uganda and living there for years. And yet, the New York Times has learned through hacked documents shared with the paper, Mamdani identified as both Asian and African-American on an application to Columbia University. Mamdani, of course, put his Muslim faith and South Asian descent front and center in his campaign. How is this revelation playing with New Yorkers?  There certainly seems to be some voters that are saying this is a bit of a bridge too far, but this of course does come in as Mondani has faced criticism on various other fronts, including his lack of a desire, or at least a lack of willingness, to condemn, for example, the idea of globalize the Intifada. There are these various aspects of Mondani that some voters are clearly not very comfortable with. One of the things that he is trying to do right now, and he's doing this to some degree with some success,  is to basically get all of the mainstream front and center Democrats behind him as they go into now the general campaign. Whereas Cuomo had a lot of endorsements from, for example, labor unions and other groups during the primary, they're now lining up behind Mamdani.  One of the key folks to keep an eye on, at least that I'm watching here in Washington, is Congressman Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer. Jeffries is not yet endorsed, nor has Schumer, and Jeffries is set to have a conversation with Mamdani in person at the end of the week. Obviously, he is the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, could be Speaker of the House, depending on how some key races fall next year. When Mayor Eric Adams ran and won, he ran on crime. He's a former police officer. What is the top issue, you think, in this race?  At this point, at least it seems, and if anything you can take away from the primary, it seems that affordability is front and center. Whereas back in 2022 or 2020, what year is it now? 2021 rather, really front and center was we were coming out of the COVID pandemic. There was a peak in crime. And so part of Adams' successful message as a former member of the NYPD was I'm going to push back on crime.  Now we've kind of turned the corner on some of those crime rates, and it seems that the affordability crisis, the inability to afford rent, and so forth, might be really the defining mark for this race. It's going to be an interesting race, and there's a lot of months. I'm sure there'll be investigations and articles and a lot of opal research in that time. So great to have you on the show tonight, Kevin Frey. We appreciate it.  No problem, Tom. Elmo's World now causing controversy. The ex-account for the beloved Sesame Street character posting a string of racist and anti-Semitic comments over the weekend. Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind the popular children's show confirming Elmo's account, had been hacked.  NBC's Melanie Zenona has been following this for a while and joins me now. Melanie, thanks for joining Top Story tonight. I thought Elmo might be too young to be on X, but apparently not. He has an account. In all seriousness, though, break down this for us and also why this is so sad, right, for X.  Yeah, this all started on Sunday when Elmo's account began posting this very hateful and racist content. It also posted some derogatory comments about President Donald Trump in connection to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Now, we should know that NBC News was not able to independently verify these posts before they were deleted. But Sesame Workshop, that's the nonprofit behind Elmo and Sesame Street, did put out a statement confirming that the account was hacked, although it is still unclear at this point who was behind the hack. I want to read you part of their statement. They said,  Elmo's ex-account was compromised today by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including anti-Semitic and racist posts. We are working to restore full control of the account.\" And since that statement, it does appear that they have been able to regain control and secure that account. The posts were deleted. His bio, Elmo's bio, was restored. But this caused quite the nightmare on Sesame Street. A beloved Muppet in character  that really did, you know, he's done these other things in the past, gone viral for starting a mental health conversation, saying, Elmo checking in, how are you doing? So just a very sad sort of situation to see play out here. Yeah, those hackers are pretty heartless. I do want to ask you, this is sort of the second or third or fourth hate speech scandal to hit X in under a week, coming just days after Elon Musk's AI chatbot made a series of anti-Semitic posts which have since been deleted. Does Elon Musk or the team behind X show any signs of cracking down?  Well the AI company that's behind Grok did issue apology for what they called horrific behavior on the platform. The company also said they did conduct an internal investigation and they determined that the root cause was an update to the code path upstream of the Grok bot. However it isn't clear what additional measures or crackdowns they're going to take.  to prevent this from happening again. And this is not the first time that we've actually seen this type of hateful comments popping up on the GROK chat bot itself. And so there is also going to be a resignation we already saw from X, the CEO of X, stepping down. They also did introduce a new version of GROK, GROK4, right after  these alarming posts, but there are still calls for more accountability to prevent the platform from not only spreading this hate speech, but from providing it itself. Yeah, and before you go, Mellie, since we have you here, it's sort of in the same vein. All of this happening as the Senate is expected to vote this week on whether or not to take back funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports children's programming like Sesame Street. Is there any talk of a possible connection here to this?  Well, these cuts had actually been in the work for quite some time on Capitol Hill. Both PBS and NPR have been top targets of Trump, who's really pushing Congress to get this over the finish line and get it to its desk this week. But Tom, I got to tell you, there are Republicans who have concerns with this bill. There are Republicans like Susan Collins who have concerns with the cuts to foreign aid programs. And then you have other Republicans who are concerned with the cuts to PBS and NPR, which they say are crucial.  to providing not only news, but also weather alerts to rural areas, which, of course, is top of mind after those horrific floods in Texas last week. So we could see some changes to the bill. If that happens, though, it needs to go back to the House. And the time is ticking here because Congress has a deadline of needing to act by July 19th, which is Friday.  All right, Melanie, we thank you for having on Top Story tonight. Up next, what might be the strangest bust you'll ever hear about. German officials foiling a plan to smuggle 1,500 tarantulas into the country. And you won't believe where they found them. Plus, pediatricians sounding the alarm over nicotine poisonings in children. The number of kids getting sick from nicotine pouches and other products skyrocketing. What parents need to know. That's coming up right here on Top Story.  We're back now with Top Story's Global Watch, and we begin in South Korea, where officials there are ordering airlines operating Boeing aircraft to inspect fuel cutoff switches. The mandate comes amid safety concerns raised about the airplane parts after the deadly Air India crash. Officials have now provided a timeline for inspections. In 2018, the FAA recommended inspections of the switches on Boeing models, including the 787.  Officials in Germany foiled a plan to smuggle 1,500, get this, young tarantulas into the country inside sponge cake. The eight-legged venomous creatures were discovered in chocolate cake boxes shipped from Vietnam to Cologne's airport. Many of the spiders did not survive the trip. Those that did were given to an expert handler. Criminal proceedings have been filed against the intended recipient.  All right, and France celebrating its largest national holiday, Bastille Day, with festivities nationwide. In Paris, at least 7,000 marchers in a parade along the Champs-Elysees with horseback riders and armored vehicles. A drone show, I should say, happening over the Eiffel Tower and fireworks in nearly every city. The holiday marks the day Parisians stormed the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, sparking, of course, the French Revolution.  At a Top Stories health check and an urgent new warning for parents, the number of babies and toddlers with illnesses related to nicotine products has skyrocketed. A new study from the Medical Journal of Pediatrics say more than 130,000 cases of nicotine poisoning in kids under the age of six were recorded from 2010 to 2023. Most of the cases attributed to contact with products like  nicotine pouches and vape e-liquids. For more on what you can do to protect your kids from exposure and sickness, let's bring in NBC News Medical Contributor, Dr. Natalie Azar. Natalie, so great to see you. I want to give this stat to our viewers because this is one of the reasons why we're doing it. The number of nicotine poisoning shot up almost by seven, it shot up 763% in kids in just three years. So how are these kids ending up sick from nicotine and is it those zinc pouches that have become so popular?  Yeah, well, I mean, I agree, Tom, that I think we've seen a significant rise in the popularity of a lot of different products in lieu of people smoking cigarettes, including these nicotine pouches, as well as vapes. And they're almost really ubiquitous.  I think, you know, children are uniquely susceptible to toxicity from these, Tom, given simply their size. The average amount of nicotine that is contained, let's say, in a pouch of Zin, is anywhere from about one and a half to 15 milligrams of nicotine. But as little as one to two milligrams can be toxic to a toddler, as opposed to really a much, much higher amount that adults can tolerate before they can experience toxicity.  But I guess the big question is, Dr. Azar, why are kids getting into them? Is there something that these nicotine products now look like that they didn't look like before?  So kids have always been susceptible to putting things in their mouths that they shouldn't. You know, it's not necessarily that they're flavored. You know, we talk about that a lot with vaping and with teens. But I think it's just, it's something small lying around the house. Children are going to put that in their mouths quite simply. That can suck on them. It's exactly the right size or the wrong size, you know, for exposure if you have little ones in the house, Tom.  Dr. Azar, if your child does suffer from nicotine poisoning, what are some of the symptoms and do you call 911? Should you rush your child to the ER?  Yeah, so in the first couple of minutes after exposure, Tom, some of the symptoms could include sweating, agitation, nausea, vomiting, a high heart rate. But after that, that's when it gets kind of critical, where children can experience a drop in blood pressure, a drop in their heart rate, and even coma. And so if you ever are suspicious about any kind of exposure or ingestion of nicotine with those early signs or symptoms that I mentioned, you need to call 911 immediately.  All right, Dr. Azar, always a pleasure to have you on Top Story. We thank you so much. We learned a lot here. When Top Story returns, some hope in the midst of heartache.

Eastland later died in the floods.  Following the tragic loss of life, growing scrutiny over the lack of warnings from officials, who are the only ones able to tell residents to evacuate or shelter in place. It wasn't like a tornado. It wasn't like a hurricane even. It lasted all day. We asked Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice on who has authority to issue alerts at a city level. And who, what person would that be? So ultimately, ultimately it's me.  Ultimately, I have the ultimate authority to be able to make those decisions based on. Rice adding he was managing rescues and says other local officials can also blast out citywide warnings. Did you issue one? Yeah. So I did not.

Next, our NBC News exclusive, the parents of one of the four murdered Idaho college students speaking out about that chilling confession, their reaction to seeing Brian Coburger for the first time just ahead.  Now to our NBC News exclusive, the parents of Ethan Chapin, one of the four victims in the Idaho College murders case, speaking out about the moment they saw their son's killer in court. Here's Liz Kreutz. He's going to get what's coming to him. I really don't care what happens to the guy. He's off the streets. He can't hurt any more kids.  Jim and Stacey Chapin say they can finally breathe again, knowing that Brian Koberger, the man who killed their son, his girlfriend, Zanna Kernodal, and her housemates, Kaley Gonzalez and Madison Mogan, will spend the rest of his life behind bars. Did you kill and murder Ethan Chapin, a human being? Yes.  Koberger recently pled guilty in a deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty and gave the parents the assurance he'll never be allowed to appeal. The Chapin spoke to NBC exclusively for the first time since that chilling confession. Was that your first time seeing Brian Koberger in person? Yes. What was that like? Honestly, I really didn't give it a thought, because it doesn't matter. It's done. It's just shocking, the wreckage that is that person.  Their focus now, remembering Ethan. His parents and triplet siblings, Maisie and Hunter, reflect on his life in a new Amazon Prime documentary, One Night in Idaho. Ethan was definitely like the leader. Like I would go to him and Hunter would go to him. We were raised very centered around family. So we were friends with everyone, but we were best friends with each other.  The family remembers their best friend by holding on to things he loved. Ethan's Jeep still parked in the garage. It was just so him. I mean, he even had the flag and the grill. In what ways do you feel Ethan's presence? Everywhere in this house.  I mean, he just could just blow into any room and had something funny to say. We feel very fortunate to have had him for 20 years. Is closure a word you could use to describe the plea deal for your family? Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Now we get to just move on. Yeah. Yeah, there's big time closure.  Liz Kreutz, NBC News. When we come back, the stunning moment a paraglider crashed into power lines, then fell into a river. The miracle rescue, next.

Here in New York City, four kids were spotted by police drones riding on top of train cars, a dangerous trend known as subway surfing. Two of the boys are only 12 years old. Police boarded that train, and all four kids were taken into custody. Earlier this month, a teen died after being found on top of a train car. Police believe he had been trying to subway surf.

So, are we all ready to go? All right. Okay, well, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, July 13th, marked one year since the tragedy that struck my hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman nearly assassinated President Trump. Tragically, he took the life of Corey Competore and seriously wounded David Dutch and James Copenhaver.  Yesterday I returned to the Butler Farm Showgrounds where I was with the President a year ago. I met with the Comptatore family during a celebration of Corey's life. They are incredibly strong and I know all of us on stage continue to send our thoughts and prayers to them as we seek more answers about what actually happened that day. Now we're here today to highlight  new resolution H.R. 571, which formally recognized the events of 2014 and July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. The resolution also condemns the rise in political violence we have seen across our nation over the last year.  from the assassination attempts against President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania and West Palm Beach, Florida, to the attacks against Governor Josh Shapiro in April, and to the deadly attacks on the Minnesota state lawmakers just last month. Let's be clear. We must stand up together to oppose violence against our nation's leaders all across each party. And I want to thank my co-lead on the resolution,  RSC Chairman August Lugar from Texas. When we talk about this, though, we could have as many resolutions as we want to bring it forward. And I've heard person after person, politician after politician, get up and say, I am absolutely appalled by the violence is taking place in this country today. And we've got to stop using that type of language. And with 24 hours, they're out talking again about who should not be sitting in certain offices.  So it's one thing to have a resolution. It's one thing to be resolved the fact we're not going to keep talking like this. What I'm asking all our Congress, everybody that's in the Congress, everybody that's in elected office, please watch what you say. Don't start off saying we should never do this and then within 24 hours go out and make statements again that incite people. That's a false lead. It's a false premise. Our resolution is an attempt to get people to speak  the way they should speak. In America, the way we settle things is by votes. So it's my pleasure to be with all these people behind me today because they're all feeling the same way."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker commemorates the one-year anniversary of a tragic event in Butler, Pennsylvania where a gunman attacked a political rally, killing one person and injuring several others.

Y'all, this started under the Obama administration when they decided to illegally investigate conservative groups, when they were out there demonizing Republicans who just simply wanted to follow the Constitution and make our country better. Then you fast forward to the Biden administration, who, they put this on steroids and actually allowed the public to take part in this game.

And they didn't just encourage it, y'all, they promoted it. Hey, they even paid for their bail. The other thing I want to make a point is, and I think Representative Green hit the nail on the head, y'all, we got a morality problem in this country.  There's no value to the sanctity of life anymore. Socialist, woke politicians, they want to have people to look to the government for every answer they need. We don't look to the government. We're supposed to look towards God for our answers. What happened in Butler? That's an example. An example of the consequences of this Democrat rhetoric.

Thank you, Madam President. Two weeks ago, Republicans passed one of the most unpopular bills in the history of the country. One of the most unpopular bills in the history of the country. And now that it's law, we don't have to imagine anymore what might happen.  We know for sure what's going to happen to tens of millions of people all across the country. I want to focus on five things that are going to happen. Five things that are going to happen because we no longer have to talk about a House version and a Senate version or what the President says he wants or what someone says they're going to, you know, if I don't get this, I'm going to vote no. Now we have a law. We have public law, federal law. First thing that's going to happen,  17 million Americans, including 9 million people on Medicaid, will lose health care coverage in about 18 months' time.  To keep their coverage, people will have to complete hours and hours of paperwork just to prove that they're working. That's in spite of the fact that the number of non-disabled adults on Medicaid who don't work is very low, about 8%. So how do these work requirements actually function? Well, in Arkansas, which is one of the two states that tried this and then pulled it back because it was a failure,  The reporting portal was only open during the day and closed between the hours of 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. So let's say you work long hours as a truck driver. If you're trying to log on at night to fill out your forms, you are out of luck. Or let's say...  Something unfortunate happens to you. Let's say you get in a car accident or have a bad case of the flu. Maybe you're not hospitalized, but you are incapacitated, at least temporarily. If you miss the reporting window, you might lose the coverage. And what's preposterous about these Medicaid work requirements is in order to establish that you're either working or seeking work, you have to fill out a form. If you get sick and are bedridden and can't fill out the form, they say, don't worry.  There's an exception for a situation like that. Guess how you apply for the exception? By filling out another form. There are only a couple of people on, a couple of million people on Medicaid who even fit the description of someone who's non-disabled and on Medicaid, and yet the actual official projections, which is to say the way they save the money is they're projecting many, many millions of people are going to get kicked off of Medicaid even though they're eligible.  And I know I'm a Democrat and I wanted this bill to fail and I want to tell you why this is a failure of a bill, but that's literally in their projections. Without those projections, they don't have enough revenue for the biggest tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the history of the planet. Number two, hundreds of rural hospitals and nursing homes will close without enough funding to continue operating.  More people are going to get sick because of this law, but we're going to have fewer hospitals and doctors to take care of them.  Why? Because Medicaid is a big revenue stream for really all hospitals, but especially rural hospitals. It can be up to about half of what they call the payer mix. What is a payer mix? It's just, you might get paid by private insurance 30%, you might get paid by Medicaid 45%, you might have a little VA, you might have a little private pay, adds up to 100%. So as you look at your revenue picture, 40, 50, sometimes even more percent of that money comes from Medicaid.  If there's a huge $1 trillion nationwide reduction in Medicaid money, that money is reduced money for rural hospitals. And rural hospitals will definitely close. Not all of them, but many of them. So even if you're not on Medicaid, if you live in a place where there's a rural hospital, and that's the flagship hospital for a small town,  That might not be available to you. You might have to drive two or three hours for care, even emergency care. Number three, starting next year, tens of millions of people are going to pay hundreds of dollars a month more for health insurance. And this one I think we should linger on because now that the fight over Obamacare is sort of in the rear view mirror,  People just think they get onto the ACA portal, they sign up for their health care, and they pay what they pay, right? Like, oh, I want a family plan, I want this level of deductible, and then it spits out how much you're going to pay every month. What tens of millions of people don't actually know is those rates on the exchange are subsidized.  And without those subsidies, we're going to go back to the bad old days, pre-Obamacare, when people would pay absurd amounts of money for their healthcare insurance, even if they're employed, even if they do have insurance. And what is, I think, underrated, both politically and on policy, is all of those rates get set in the next couple of months.  Because in order to start paying and in order to start enrolling, you've got to notify people, hey, your thing that was $289 a month, now it's $789 a month. And so sometime in the fall, it depends on the state.  October, November, some people in December are going to get a letter saying, if you want to stay on the same health care plan, here's your new price. And those new prices are going to be astronomical. Now, we do have a disagreement between the parties. I think there are a lot of people who just don't like  public subsidy of healthcare insurance premiums. I'm sure the presiding officer has her reservations about that kind of thing. It is about the size and the scope of government, but there is a factual aspect to this, which is whatever one's governing philosophy is, whatever one thought about the Affordable Care Act,  The plain fact of the matter is people are going to get letters from their insurance carriers with astronomical increases that they will not be able to pay. Number four, five million people are either going to lose some or all of their nutritional assistance starting next year. You know, this trope is like almost as old as I am.  like some lazy person on food stamps, just like collecting food stamps, loving that life, going to the store, buying fancy stuff. It's $6 a day. The average nutritional assistance amount per person per day is $6.  We have actually, I don't know if you know this, but we have subsidized food in the United States Senate. Not because the government's paying for it, but because all the restaurants that operate here don't have to pay lease rent. So it's a little bit cheaper than you would normally get. I can't get anything for six bucks downstairs in the Dirksen cafeteria. Not that would feed me. Six dollars a day is the average amount. And what the Republicans decided to do is to generate savings  is to find savings, to cut nutritional assistance. Why? Because they needed to pay for the biggest tax cut in American history for the wealthiest people and corporations that have ever existed. It would be one thing if people were getting $75 a day for food. It would be one thing if they were getting $25 a day for food. But they're getting $6. And 5 million people  will now have an enormously difficult time trying to figure out just how to survive the day. And I mean that quite literally, survive the day. Find the calories within your $6 or $8 or $12 budget. Finally, people are going to pay hundreds of dollars more per year on electricity because this bill throttles the cheapest and most abundant form of energy in wind and solar.  And this is where you've got to stay with me for a moment. I'm very passionate about climate action. I think it is a planetary emergency. I think it is a moral obligation that we take care of our planet so it can sustain us for generations to come. But even if you don't care about that, the only energy that is ready to come online right now  is solar energy, some wind energy, but mostly solar energy. Why? Because nuclear, frankly, takes at least 10 years to permit and site. And of course, anytime anyone wants to do any nuclear power generation, everybody in whatever neighborhood or state or county that is tries to stop it. And so you don't just have regulatory risk, you have project risk. 10 years is an optimistic scenario. I'm a big believer in nuclear energy.  But 10 years is the most realistic scenario to get a bunch of nuclear energy online. Likewise, geothermal, maybe five to eight years in the most optimistic scenario. Again, I love geothermal energy. I think it's an untapped resource across the United States of America. We have about a six-year gap before any of those other technologies are ready. And so a lot of fossil advocates go, well, why don't we do more gas?  There is a backlog of combined cycle gas turbines. And that can't just be fixed by saying, I will take more. Everybody wants more. There is a backlog. You cannot get gas generation online in the next five years. So what does that mean? It means over the next five years, solar is the stuff that is like instantly pluggable into the grid, super cheap, not terribly controversial, except for in this chamber.  and ready to power the AI revolution and whatever other load needs we have. But this bill kind of punitively, kind of ideologically decides, no, we're not for all of the above. You know that thing we said about whatever's cheap and plentiful and available every time we were trying to prevent clean energy from coming on the grid? Remember that thing we used to say? Now, really what we meant is we quite hate solar energy particularly. We hate solar energy.  Again, I think that's preposterous from a planetary standpoint. But even if there were no planetary crisis, this is the energy that is available to us. And we are about to face energy shortages. The reason, for instance, Texas of all places has not had blackouts and brownouts is because solar can absorb when the sun is high and it is 108 degrees and everybody's pumping their air conditioner, that also happens to be  the point in time, the point of the day, when all the solar farms are running at full capacity, and they can power the grid. And so solar energy isn't something from 17 years ago where you say, you know, sometimes the sun's shining, and sometimes it's not, and it's intermittent, and the batteries aren't there. All of that is in the rear view mirror. All the technical issues, not all of them, 90% of the technical issues related to solar energy have been resolved. And that's the scariest thing for the fossil energy people.  You know why? Because they can't argue that this isn't economically smarter. They just have to argue that it's like woke or something, like woke electrons. Who cares where the electrons come from? If they are cheap and plentiful, we should all be for them. And so this bill is going to create shortages, which will drive up prices and, in some places, reduce power quality. What does power quality mean? It means we're going to have blackouts and brownouts across the country.  So to do any of these things in a bill would be bad. But to do all of it, all of it, in order to pay for the biggest wealth transfer from the poor to the rich in history is morally and economically bankrupt. Nobody asked for any of this. Trump voters were not demanding any of this. Nobody was asking to lose their health care and not be able to feed their kids or pay more to keep the lights on at home.  But they raced to do it anyway, knowing full well how devastating it would be for the country and for their own home states. One final point. We are not going to stop talking about this.  We are going to talk about this until it is repealed. We're going to talk about this when the rates go up for your electricity. We're going to talk about this when kids are thrown off their nutritional assistance. We're going to talk about this when rural hospitals close. We are going to talk about this when your insurance coverage rates go up. We are not going to stop talking about this because this document, which was enacted into law,  is a perfect encapsulation of the difference between the political parties. My party is flawed, obviously. My party is flawed. But I've never seen my party propose a bill that transferred so much money from the poor to the rich.  And I've never seen my party propose a bill that raises the price of electricity, that raises the price of food, and raises the price of health care. And so we're going to talk about this today, tomorrow, for the next 18 months, and until this thing is repealed from the federal law books. I yield the floor."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": null, "SPEAKER_01": null, "SPEAKER_02": null, "SPEAKER_03": null, "SPEAKER_04": null, "SPEAKER_04 (Trump)": null, "SPEAKER_05": null, "SPEAKER_06": null, "SPEAKER_07": null, "Sam Schweppe": null, "Scarlett Fu": null, "Secretary of State Marco Rubio": null, "Selena Zito": null, "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Senator Chuck Grassley": null, "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer": null, "Senator Patty Murray": null, "Senator Susan Collins": null, "Stephen A.

Aren't you proud about what the U.S. Coast Guard just did in Texas to help those individuals?  Texas just went through an incredible tragedy with the flooding event that happened and is still looking for their loved ones and for children and have been absolutely devastated. And the individuals who showed up there from the Coast Guard, from Border Patrol, those individuals from the BORTAC teams, from FEMA that showed up immediately and supported that state in its response to its individuals, I'm so proud of them because for the very first time, we acted in a way that disaster response should.  You know, the way statute lays out is that every emergency that happens in this country should be locally executed. That means the people that are closest to that emergency need to be the ones making the decisions to respond to people. It should be state-managed, which means the state makes the decisions on how they're going to universally handle this disaster. And the federal government, our role should be to support. We should be there to support. We shouldn't be making the decisions  We should be sending the support that is necessary to get that state through that situation and that's exactly how we implemented it in Texas and are continuing to do so to support Texas as it gets through this. And at the exact same time New Mexico was flooding, North Carolina had  some flooding events going on, and we continue to stand on watch to make sure that we're there to support people across this country. Regardless if you're Republican, Democrat, independent, if you love freedom and if you love this country, we are going to be there for you to help support you and get you through the most challenging days of your lives. Now, I'm here tonight, and I'm not going to talk much longer. I guess it says I have 19 minutes. I'm not going to talk that long.  But what I do want to talk to you about is that you guys are the future. People will tell you throughout life that there are things that will determine what you're going to be. They will tell you that the family that you're raised in, or the city that you're in, or the community is, is going to impact your future. I would disagree with that. People will tell you many times that your education will determine who you're going to be and what you will be. It'll open up doors for you and create new opportunities. I would say that I disagree with that.  Our Department of Homeland Security interacts with all of those areas. It interacts with even the jobs that you're going to have. The one thing I want to remind all of you here today, and one of the important reasons why I think that you should recognize that you are here, is because what still makes the world move, what still will determine your success in life, is relationships, is the people that you meet, the people that you spend time with, the people that you talk to,  I would encourage you to continue to stay involved, to go out there and to come to conferences like this, meet people, go shake hands. You never know when the next person that you meet may be your next mentor that will give you the greatest advice that turned your life around, that changed everything for you.  The next person you meet may be the person that gives you a reference for your next internship, or your first job position that you get, or maybe the scholarship that you need to get the degree that you want. Maybe you will meet somebody when you show up for an opportunity when that door is open that will be your next business partner. Don't leave this conference without recognizing that the most valuable thing that you gained here was the relationships that you built, the people that you talked to, and the people that you were with.  I've got a team around me and staff with me that every single day help me do the job that I do.

And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent.  but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defence industrial production. So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you that at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, they all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more.  So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning, as Pete Hecht said, at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will be on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them. So I really want to thank you for that. And it means the European is paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that.

Just take a moment, reflect on all that has happened. Trump eviscerated the left's lawfare, and that's only beginning. And we have an investigative report tonight. He got elected president again, this time by a wide electoral margin, winning all swing states and the popular vote. And as president, his policies and actions have been a monumental success. Our border is now secure.  Criminal illegals are being deported in record numbers. Inflation is finally under control. Our economy is beginning to boom. You see it at the pump. Gas prices are at five-year lows. And the U.S. federal government, they just posted their first monthly surplus  in over 20 years. And meanwhile, Congress passed the largest tax cuts in American history. And families and working men and women are the biggest beneficiaries. No tax on tips and overtime. It is now the law of the land. We are also on a path towards energy dominance. And a nuclear-armed Iran, that has been dismantled. What a difference one year and one millimeter can make. And we are not officially at the six-month mark of Donald Trump being president.  for now the second time. Unfortunately, we are still dealing with many of the threats that were left behind from the last administration. ICE is working around the clock to identify, locate, deport violent criminals. That includes murderers, rapists, other violent criminals and known terrorists in our country, Iranian assassination squads in our country, cartel members, gang members, drug dealers, all in our country.  On top of all of this breaking tonight, extremists in Iran have reportedly raised a whopping $40 million as a reward for assassinating President Trump. This all because Joe and Kamala and Mayorkas, they all lied to us for four years. They said the border was closed, but they allowed millions and millions of unvetted illegal immigrants from over 200 countries  including countries with terror ties, into our country. The task ahead is monumental. The good news is a lot of progress is being made, but it's going to be hard. Thousands of criminal, illegal aliens are now taken into ICE custody every week.

What do we call that? Oh, that's right, child abuse, alongside a notorious sex predator from Mexico. And now the left, they are upped in arms, not because of that, not because Joe Biden allowed violent predators to cross into our country unvetted and then lost track of literally  to hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors, but because ICE is now detaining criminals and rescuing these children, by the way. And as a big thank you, Democrats are attacking the people that are protecting the kids, and not just with words. Look at what's going on, according to the DHS.  Assaults on federal officials are up a whopping 700 percent. A lot of these agents are being set up. These agents get attacked now almost every single day. It is underreported. Let's look at this timeline. July 2nd, a man repeatedly ramming an ICE vehicle with his car in California. July 4th, a group of far-left extremists attacking an ICE detention facility in Texas. In that case, shooting a local law enforcement officer in the process.  July 7, a gunman opening fire at the entrance of the United States Border Patrol annex in Texas. July 8, mass rioters assaulting ICE agents at a San Francisco courthouse. July 10, scores of rioters attacking ICE agents that  farm, at that marijuana farm in California. One even pulled a weapon and fired it in the direction of law enforcement on July 11th. More violence against federal officials, this time in Portland, Oregon. And tonight, a California state professor is now facing federal charges after throwing a tear gas canister at law enforcement. And we could pretty much go on for the rest of the hour. On and on and on. Make no mistake.  There is a huge violence problem on the left. But instead of supporting federal officials, instead of recognizing the Constitution, which, of course, gives the authority and jurisdiction to the feds in this particular case\u2014it's called the Supremacy Clause\u2014Democrats, they only add fuel to the fire. They are more interested in the so-called rights of illegals than they are about the safety and security of Americans in small towns.  and big cities, and they have been vilifying ICE around every turn. And as a result, the threats of violence get larger and larger, on top of doxing ICE agents and their families. And instead of calling on cooler heads to prevail, the Party of Peace, even Obama is telling his fellow Democrats to, quote, toughen up, have some courage. Not that he had any. But none of this is going to stop the Trump administration from doing their job, protecting the country. These deportations will continue.  Hey, Sean Hannity here.

For working and middle class families, that means more money directly into the pockets of every single American watching your show tonight.

We will continue to work hard. And I just want to say to your audience, there is not a more hardworking president than Donald J. Trump. I witness it with my own two eyes every day. That man is working around the clock. He hardly ever sleeps. He's constantly thinking about not just the problems in our country here, but around this world and how to solve them. And look at what he's done on the world stage with bringing peace to the Middle East,  withdrawing Russia and Ukraine to actually talk directly for the first time in this war in years. We see what's happening with the hostages coming out of Gaza, and he's going to keep pushing until every last hostage is out.

There never has been a client list. A client list suggests that Jeffrey Epstein made a list of people to whom he trafficked women. What there is, is a redacted FBI affidavit  from accusers, there are several of them, from accusers that accuse Jeffrey, that accuse various people of having improper sex. And that has been redacted. The names of the people accused have been blacked out. Now, of course, because I was the lawyer and I did all the investigations, I know who all these people are. I could figure out, based on everything that  I saw who Mr. X is, Mr. Y is, and Mr. Z. I can tell you right now, none of them are public figures who are currently in office. Some of them were previously in office. Some of them are dead. But there is no client list.  And the redactions could be undone if you go to court. So, many of the things that are being suppressed are being suppressed by two judges in Manhattan. And they're doing it largely to protect the alleged accusers, who are, in the view of the judges, victims, even though we don't know what their actual status is, but the judges have  issued orders, which is why I can't disclose things I'd love to disclose, saying that you can't disclose this information. But Pam Bondi and the Justice Department and Donald Trump are not responsible for that. I don't know of any information that they could disclose that they haven't disclosed. Now, maybe there is some, but I'm simply not aware of it. And so I think it's important to place the blame where the blame deserves to be placed.  The vast majority of people who are in the files\u2014and I know them all. I've seen all the names. The vast, vast majority of them have already been disclosed. They're in articles all over the world. They're in books that have been written. So, if we got everything, everything, you would be shocked how few  Names are there that haven't already been disclosed. The media hasn't, by the way, done a good enough job in finding the people who have been disclosed in the public record. So that's that list. Then there's the videotapes. People say there must be sex tapes. I know the whole story there. There is a videotape, maybe several videotapes.  They came under the following circumstances. Before any of this happened, Epstein was robbed by one of his employees of money and of a licensed gun. And he called the Palm Beach police, and they installed video cameras, not in the bedrooms, but in the living room.  And those video cameras recorded some people, but there's no sexual allegations there. So, there's nothing to that. And then there's Tucker Carlson's absurd allegations about the Mossad. There, I know it from very, very personal experience. Why?  I was representing Jeffrey Epstein. I asked him about everything, including whether he had any contacts with intelligence agencies. If he had, he would have been dying to tell me that, because I could have used that to get him a better deal. If he had worked with the Mossad or the CIA, that would have been golden for me. But, of course, he said no. And then I checked it with my sources in Israel.  Let me clear. I once represented the Mossad. When five Israeli Mossad agents were captured in Cyprus, the head of the Mossad asked me to represent them. I did. I got them out. And the Mossad sent me a congratulatory note. I'm friendly with many of the people who have been heads of the Mossad. I'm not going to tell you who my sources are, but I can tell you with absolute certainty he had no connections to Mossad.  He only got connected to Israel very late in this when he met Ehud Barak and he made business dealings with him. But there was no connection to Mossad. The reason that story generated is because his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell's father, probably did have a connection to Mossad, Robert Maxwell, but it had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. And as far as the suicide is concerned,  Of course it was a suicide, but it was a suicide, I believe, assisted by jailers. It was not a suicide that he could have committed alone. I think the jailers had something to do with his cellmate being dismissed, with the cameras being turned off. So there are things that can be hidden.

We're seeing the beginnings of an M&A boom here. Even as it may not feel like it, because often the deals seem, well, dowdy, or let's say, not clear yet, or in the future. I mean, you could have seen it on Kraft Times. It's reportedly breaking up soon. People are yawning. So what? They're saying big deal. I say, no, that is dead wrong.  Company said to be planning to keep its faster growing brands like maybe Heinz Ketchup, a lot of new derivatives there, Kraft Mac and Cheese, Pacific, I'm sorry, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, while separating the brands with the slowest growth like Oscar Mayer packaged foods, Velveeta Cheese. The deal putting Heinz and Kraft together sounded like a match made in heaven in 2015. How could it fail? Great name brands, orchestrated by Warren Buffett and the brilliant people from 3G Capital, the uber successful Brazilian private equity firm, felt like the center of the store blockbuster.  But then people stopped going to the center aisles of the supermarket, and that spelled trouble for Oscar Mayer, for Jell-O, for Miracle Whip, for Maxwell's, for Velveeta, which apparently can survive thermonuclear war, and Cheez Whiz of Whiz Whip fame if you go to Geno's in Philly, which remains my go-to place when I head to the city of Brooklyn.  Here's what's amazing. People now think these brands have no value. But you know what. That's what they said about W.K. Kellogg. The cereal business when it split with Kellogg Nova the fast growing part of the Kellogg family which of course got a bid until the cereal choir couldn't couldn't resist C.R.E.A.L. and S.E.R.I.A.L. cereal choir. Ferraro stepped up and paid three point one billion for the maker of Fruit Loops and Corn Flakes. That was some deal last week. It was amazing.  Sure it's supposed to be a nightmare in a world where human health and human services secretary RFK Jr. is on a crusade against food coloring. But it was a dream come true for Ferraro which has spent 13 billion dollars in 10 years to expand around the globe. They don't want to be just a small Italian company. My feeling is that if Giovanni Ferraro sees value in food loops he might see some value in some of the Kraft Heinz brands too. Or consider Kenview.  Two years ago this company was spun off by Johnson and Johnson which went to unload his fantastic consumer business. Think like Tylenol, Neutrogena, Listerine, Aveeno, Sudafed, Pepsin, Band-Aid, Zyrtec and so many others all under one roof. The company picked this fellow Thibaut Mangan. He's the leader. He was the leader of J&J's consumer health division to run it.  We learned today that he was sacked after activist pressure and Kirk Perry, a current director, was named interim CEO. Kenview also announced a strategic review of its brand stable. That's what we're hoping will happen at Kraft Heinz. Is this shocking? Was it amazing that Kenview already got rid of the CEO in two years? Well, yes, if you saw the numbers.  Can you reported minus 4 percent organic growth. And Walsh was expecting plus 2 to 4 percent. But I bring this up because more deals are coming in that space. Any one of the majors we thrilled to snap some of these brands because there's very little organic growth in the industry. The only way you can have any growth is by it.  All right, now how about this merger today between Beckman Dickinson, the Life Science and Diagnostics Division, which have been shopped extensively, and Waters, a really strong company. We've had them on. A dominant player in exactly those fields. The deal was done in a very confusing reverse Morris Trust way, which is one of those tax saving situations that the street almost always hates, but the CEOs think is so smart. And they hate it because they aren't easy. They're not clean.  The merger was greeted with horrors for waters which saw its stock plunge 13.5 percent. That's part of the greeting. It shouldn't have been down that much but people didn't understand it. Back in things since getting a thirty nine point two percent stake in the newly combined waters it enters tell you this morning its stock actually finished in the black.  seemed like a great deal to me, especially because the company got $4 billion in cash and assumed $4 billion in debt. Really good deal for Beckton Dickinson. But again, it's hard to get your head around, so it didn't bring out many buyers, at least not today. Believe me, that will change and people say that not everyone lost. Oh, by the way, big winners included Barclays, which represented Waters in Citi, worked with Beckton Dickinson in a $17 billion transaction. They made out like bandits.  Well, how about one of tonight's guests, Huntington Bank shares, which announced today it was buying Veritex. I thought it was a tech company. No, it's a Dallas-based bank for $1.9 billion. I know, not huge, but it puts Huntington in the queue to shed its regional status, become much more of a national bank, at least in the parts of the nation that are good for business. CEO Steve Steinauer says that Veritex will help his Ohio-based bank move into a number of cities in Texas, which is one of the great growth states in the union.  I think this is the kind of deal we'll start to see more and more of now that we have a new banking regulatory regimen and antitrust authorities that won't reflexively block acquisitions. We'll talk to Steve Steiner later in the show about how this acquisition fits into Huntington's aggressive long term plans. In the end what matters is that deals are getting done even if they're sometimes being done at prices that don't people don't like like the waters deal.  I'm extremely confident that someone will want some of Kenview, if not all of Kenview, because those brands grow slowly. But if you put a bunch of them together, you might have something that Wall Street is very excited about. And again, it's not just about the takeover targets. These M&A deals are incredibly lucrative for the banks that orchestrate them.  The results won't necessarily be seen this quarter, so I can see why Citizens JMP, a brokerage house, might take Goldman Sachs from buy to hold. Goldman reports Wednesday, and you won't see the bump in numbers from the deal market yet. However, these Heart of July deals are terrific for the fall. You don't usually get a lot of deals during the summer, and I don't think it makes sense to sell Goldman here and then try to get back in it later. Good luck.  Even if they miss the quarter on Wednesday, it's not going to stay down for long. I'm clearly not alone as the stock actually rallied more than eight bucks today despite this downgrade. Here's the bottom line. You don't get a wave of deals out of nowhere. You get a ripple and then ever bigger waves. Right now we're in the ripple stage. That's when it's best to do some buying.  By the way, even if you think brands like Maxwell Health and Visine and Corn Pops died years ago, don't worry about it. They may not be excited to you, but there are plenty of potential buyers who are excited about that. We'd be happy to snap them up, and the regulators are no longer blocking every M&A deal under the sun. As we head into the bank earnings tomorrow, don't think about the past with Washington leaning against every deal. Think about the future, where it looks like the government is encouraging deals and is in no mood to get in the way of capitalism, at least the way we used to know it. Let's go to Rick in Oklahoma.

We're seeing the beginnings of an M&A boom here. Even as it may not feel like it, because often the deals seem, well, dowdy or, let's say, not clear yet or in the future. I mean, because you have crap times. It's reportedly breaking up soon. People are yawning. So what? So what? They're saying big deal. I say, no, that is dead wrong.  The company said it'd be planning to keep its faster-growing brands, like maybe Heinz Ketchup, a lot of new derivatives there, Kraft Mac and Cheese, Pacific, I'm sorry, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, while separating the brands with the slowest growth, like Oscar Mayer packaged foods, Velveeta Cheese. The deal putting Heinz and Kraft together sounded like a match made in heaven in 2015. How could it fail? Great name brands, orchestrated by Warren Buffett and the brilliant people from 3G Capital, the uber-successful Brazilian private equity firm, felt like the center of the store blockbuster.  But then people stopped going to the center aisles at the supermarket, and that spelled trouble for Oscar Mayer, for Jell-O, for Miracle Whip, for Maxwell's, for Velveeta, which apparently can survive thermonuclear war, and Cheez Whiz, of Whiz Whip fame, if you go to Geno's in Philly, which remains my go-to place when I head to the city of Broadway.  Here's what's amazing. People now think these brands have no value, but you know what? That's what they said about W.K. Kellogg, the cereal business, when it split with Kellanova, the fast-growing part of the Kellogg family, which, of course, got a bid. Until the cereal choir couldn't resist, C-E-R-E-A-L-N-E-S-S-E-R-I-A-L, cereal choir Ferraro stepped up and paid $3.1 billion for the make of Froot Loops and Corn Flakes. That was some deal last week. It was amazing.  Sure, it's supposed to be a nightmare in a world where Health and Human Services Secretary RFK Jr. is on a crusade against food coloring, but it was a dream come true for Ferraro, which has spent $13 billion in 10 years to expand around the globe. They don't want to be just a small Italian company. My feeling is that if Giovanni Ferraro sees value in Fruit Loops, he might see some value in some of the Kraft Heinz brands, too. Or consider Kenview.  Two years ago, this company was spun off by Johnson & Johnson, which wanted to unload its fantastic consumer business. Think like Tylenol, Neutrogena, Listerine, Aveeno, Sudafed, Pepsi, Band-Aids, Zyrtec, and so many others all under one roof. The company picked this fellow Thibaut Mangan, he was the leader of J&J's consumer health division, to run it.  We learned today that he was sacked after activist pressure and Kirk Perry, a current director, was named interim CEO. Kenview also announced a strategic review of its brand stable. That's what we're hoping will happen at Kraft Heinz. Is this shocking? Was it amazing that Kenview already got rid of the CEO in two years? Well, yes, if you saw the numbers.  Canview reported minus 4 percent organic growth, and Wall Street was expecting plus 2 to 4 percent. But I bring this up because more deals are coming in that space. Any one of the majors would be thrilled to snap some of these brands because there's very little organic growth in the industry. The only way you can have any growth is buy it.  All right, now how about this merger today between Beck and Dickinson? This was the Life Science and Diagnostics Division, which had been shopped extensively, and Waters, a really strong company. We've had them on. A dominant player in exactly those fields. The deal was done in a very confusing reverse Morris Trust way, which is one of those tax saving situations that the street almost always hates, but the CEOs think is so smart. And they hate it because they aren't easy. They're not clean.  The merger was greeted with horrors for waters, which saw its stock plunge 13.5 percent. That's part of the greeting. It shouldn't have been down that much, but people didn't understand it. Beckton Davidson is getting a 39.2 percent stake in the newly combined waters, yet after selling off this morning, its stock actually finished in the black.  Seemed like a great deal to me, especially because the company got $4 billion in cash and assumed $4 billion in debt. Really good deal for Becton Dickinson. But again, it's hard to get your head around, so it didn't bring out many buyers, at least not today. Believe me, that will change and people say that not everyone lost. Oh, by the way, big winners included Barclays, which represented Waters in Citi, worked with Becton Dickinson in a $17 billion transaction. They made out like bandits.  Well, how about one of tonight's guests, Huntington Bank shares, which announced today it was buying Veritex. I thought it was a tech company. No, it's a Dallas-based bank for $1.9 billion. I know, not huge, but it puts Huntington in the queue to shed its regional status, become much more of a national bank, at least in the parts of the nation that are good for business. CEO Steve Steinhauer says that Veritex will help his Ohio-based bank move into a number of cities in Texas, which is one of the great growth states in the union.  I think this is the kind of deal we'll start to see more and more of now that we have a new banking regulatory regimen and antitrust authorities that won't reflexively block acquisitions. We'll talk to Steve Steiner later in the show about how this acquisition fits into Huntington's aggressive long-term plans. In the end, what matters is that deals are getting done, even if they're sometimes being done at prices that people don't like, like the Waters deal.  I'm extremely confident that someone will want some of Kenview, if not all of Kenview, because those brands grow slowly. But if you put a bunch of them together, you might have something that Wall Street gets very excited about. And again, it's not just about the takeover targets. These M&A deals are incredibly lucrative for the banks that orchestrate them.  The results won't necessarily be seen this quarter, so I can see why Citizens JMP, a brokerage house, might take Goldman Sachs from buy to hold. Goldman reports Wednesday, and you won't see the bump in numbers from the deal market yet. However, these Heart of July deals are terrific for the fall. You don't usually get a lot of deals during the summer, and I don't think it makes sense to sell Goldman here and then try to get back in it later. Good luck.  Even if they miss the quarter on Wednesday, it's not going to stay down for long. I'm clearly not alone as the stock actually rallied more than eight bucks today, despite this downgrade. Here's the bottom line. You don't get a wave of deals out of nowhere. You get a ripple and then ever bigger waves. Right now, we're in the ripple stage. That's when it's best to do some buying.  By the way, even if you think brands like Maxwell House and Visine and Corn Pops died years ago, don't worry about it. They may not be excited to you, but there are plenty of potential buyers who are excited about that. We're happy to snap them up, and the regulators are no longer blocking every M&A deal under the sun. As we head into the bank earnings tomorrow, don't think about the past with Washington leaning against every deal. Think about the future, where it looks like the government is encouraging deals and is in no mood to get in the way of capitalism, at least the way we used to know it. Let's go to Rick in Oklahoma.

From that standpoint, the threat environment continues to evolve, it continues to get faster. On the same side, the defenders like CrowdStrike, who have used AI since I started the company, it was machine learning, now it's gen AI, are able to also combat what these adversaries are doing.

As in P-A-R-C, your money in these four stocks to stop worrying about tariffs, China, the Fed, pretty much anything else. Just enjoy the magic carpet ride.  If you're a tape reader as I am, then you've noticed that you tend to see four stocks go by more than any others. Palantir, Applovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase. Park. They're the meme stocks of this era. Stocks that long ago kind of ceased to be stocks, at least in a traditional way. They now become chits in the great game that is the stock market. And they're moved up like the old GameStop through sheer force of buying from home gamers who refuse to sell. Except that unlike GameStop, these are all amazing growth companies.  It's exciting to see how the mean people have figured it out. Buy the stocks of companies that are doing well and don't worry about how much you pay for them if they have great growth. There will always be someone who will want to pay more for growth. And they are right, because growth is the only safety in this market. That's why today I said I wanted to find an acronym for them, not to ridicule them, but actually because I enjoy them. I'm thrilled for them. I got to see that they're getting it. I wanted a consensus.  around these four insanely strong stocks and how they just don't have any quit in them. So Park has been born. There were others that people, let's just say now many people in my Twitter file, chose to use a far less flattering anagram embracing the same four letters in reverse order, perhaps because they don't understand how this game works.  So let me tell you, first, all four of these companies are actually fabulous businesses, well run with dynamite financials, great leadership, even if their stocks have certainly rallied to gonzo levels. Palantir is among the fastest growing tech companies I can recall. It's got a projected annual growth rate of 18 to 25 percent out to 2030, with a market capitalization of $352 billion. May not sound that impressive. Two years ago, it was $35 billion.  What does Palantir do? I say, what doesn't it do? You bring Palantir in to look at patterns to figure out how to run your business better. I've never heard anyone say that they aren't terrific at what they do, making your company money almost the minute you bring them in. They're also trying to make the Pentagon more efficient, but that's a tall order. I hope they succeed. So should you.  Applovin is a hugely profitable way for companies to advertise through mobile video games, which are typically free as long as you watch the ads. This company's got software and AI solutions that make its model unassailable. They have no real competition. The revenue growth is stunning. It was a $10 billion company two years ago. Now it's $120 billion, as this is the company that can get your ad in front of everyone who plays games on their phone. I know it's richly valued. I don't care. When you have no competition, well, guess what?  You do pretty darn well. Do I have to describe Robinhood to you? It's an app. No, it's a bank. No, it's a repository of wealth for the millennials, whatever you want to call it. Robinhood has 25 million accounts and it offers ETFs, options, gold, and crypto. It came out of nowhere. This company was worth $11 billion two years ago. Now it's $88 billion. Again, incredibly profitable. Out of nowhere. It seems to have captured young people who would otherwise not bother to invest. You know what I say? Hallelujah.  Finally, Coinbase means crypto. 52 million Americans have kept their crypto there, part of 100 million users globally. It's the only crypto company in the S&P 500, so it's the perfect poster child for the group. Again, Coinbase, immensely profitable, and at 40 times earnings, it's actually the cheapest of the group. How can that be?  All right, there you got it. It's Park. Now, why did I think of this? Because on Friday, we held our CNBC Investing Club annual meeting. It was a joyous event. We really lit it up. One individual wanted to know if we'd ever recommend speculative stocks. I said, we run a charitable trust. And while I approve of speculation, most people don't, I didn't feel it was in keeping with our mission. But I thought about it all weekend. I realized that I should just give you the list of stocks where it seems like if you enter a sell order and it was found out, they'd tar and feather you.  Is there any valuation that would be too much to pay for park? I can tell you from where I stand, absolutely not. The money is parked in these names. The buyers are insatiable. They are for speculation about as great a gift as you could possibly have. At least for now and probably for some time to come. Just remember to ring the register for some of it on the way up. Try to take out your cost basis and then the ultimate thing you could do, play with the house's money. Oh, shh, I won't tell anyone that you sold it, I promise.

Your economic acumen here and the research that you've done is something that I'd like to ask you about, because sanctions are one thing.  And that's another bit. Secondary sanctions, something else we talk about a lot, but we never quite get to. This was on the table for the balance of the Biden administration, but we're looking at some pretty hefty numbers here, whether it's 100% or 500% max.

What's happened for Russia is that the Russian oil sector has been diverted to India and China in particular.  And the United States has been very reticent, in particular, to sanction India. We are trying to develop close ties with India. We see India as a strong potential partner vis-a-vis China. And we've also been reticent in some ways to go after a number of Chinese banks and other Chinese entities. So I think, you know, with this tariff play, we'll see. It could have real ramifications, I think, for Russia's oil sector.  But it would also have real implications for the United States bilateral relations. And the thing we have to remember is part of what the Biden administration was trying to do was to keep Russian oil on the global market. We wanted Russia to take a haircut in terms of how much profit it was getting in terms of sales. But we didn't really have a problem with Russia selling oil. We just wanted to sell it at a haircut.  because we wanted Russian oil on the market to keep global prices low. The Trump administration, I think, is taking a bit more of a blunt approach.

China has demonstrated its willingness to use rare earths and other things to hit back at the United States. So, you know, China does recognize that its oil dependence, its dependence on Russia as well as the Middle East, represents a real strategic vulnerability. It's part of the reason why they are going  a whole hog into renewables and clean technology. But for China, I think this could be really significant if the U.S. does impose this.

We want you to open up the taps, put more oil on the market. We shall see if they do that. The Biden administration, I think, didn't feel that it had the political relationship to actually do that. And the Saudis, I don't think were willing to. But with Trump, maybe it's different. I think the bigger, broader question here, though,  is that Trump has not shown a lot of interest in trying to really stick it to the Russians, economically or militarily. He has not demonstrated in the past a lot of support for Ukraine. If that is shifting, the question is how far does that shift? I think what we've seen is a partial shift,  The US now looks like it's going to continue military supplies. But there's no indication Trump is going to go to Congress, try to ramp up our production for Ukraine. And then the economic question is, how much of an economic hit is the president willing to absorb to stick it to the Russians in support of Ukraine? There's limits to what the Biden administration would do.  So I do have some doubts about how far we are willing to go. And I think Russia may just try to call our bluff here. And it'll be really interesting when the 50 or 60 days expire, whether that prompts sort of a strong US reaction. But there could be a good outcome if we just simply get India to lower the amount it's buying.

Now, what I hope happens in the next 50 days is that there's a ramp up on European efforts to support Ukraine militarily. I think that's happening. But then also that the U.S. begins to negotiate with India and perhaps even with China to reduce oil flows from Russia into India, and that maybe there is talks with the Saudis about offsetting any cuts to Russian supplies on the global market.

And when we look back a couple of years here, how do we rationalize the fact that we've been having this conversation about our defense industrial base for decades, and we really don't have a greater capacity to show for it?

We were running at about 25% of the proper level of munitions order. In other words,  When we needed four, we ordered one. When you do that over 20 years, you really create a deficit. And worse, you tell the defense industrial based companies, I'm not going to do major orders. And they reduce their ability to produce. So what you've seen over the last three years are  pretty consistent from the supplemental, the Ukraine supplemental, Taiwan supplemental a couple of years ago, this year's budget and next year's budget, actual investments in the defense industrial base where the United States is contributing to defense industrial base companies like Lockheed and Raytheon and Northrop Grumman to expand their ability, their capacity to produce.

Ukraine is fighting four countries, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China. And in fact, Russia today is firing more artillery from North Korea than their own. In other words, the majority of the artillery being used by Russia is North Korean. North Korea gave about 6 million rounds, which is 20 years of U.S. production to the Russians. Iran has built a Shaheed drone factory in  Russia, after giving them thousands of their own Shaheed drones or selling them, they now have a factory there producing it. That's what's hammering the Ukrainian cities every night. And the third thing is China has been backstopping the economy with increases in imports and exports, but equally importantly, providing the microelectronics that are used in Russian cruise and ballistic missiles.  So all three of these countries, this axis of authoritarians are supporting the fourth Russia in this fight. And that's who Ukraine's been going against.

They had talked about releasing the files, the Epstein files to the extent there are in client lists. And now they're in this moment where they're trying to walk that all back.  But they've created this sort of intensity with their base, and the MAGA movement that Trump created really wants answers on this. And the idea that the carpet has been pulled out from underneath them so abruptly really isn't sitting well with them. Trump has traditionally been very Teflon with his base, where he can have missteps, he can have things they might slightly disagree with, but they always come home. But I can tell you, in the convention center in Tampa this weekend,  It felt different. It felt like this is going to be a little more difficult.

Director Patel has since put out a tweet publicly saying that he is not leaving, he's going to stay with the administration. I think, again, that's sort of  the effort to try to move beyond this moment, even if that might be a little more difficult for the White House. So Bongino is a podcaster, had a large media following, and he is among the people who helped amplify the Epstein stuff. So I think there is some sense he wants to preserve here and wants to make sure that he still has credibility with Trump supporters in the MAGA base when and if he leaves the administration."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 276.781, "text": " So that credibility question leads me to my next thought.

And again because Trump built  some credibility with his base on this issue is a main talking point for a very long time. So to the degree that you can put the toothpaste sort of back in the MAGA tube feels like it might be a little more difficult this time, because one, the allegations are terrible that the Epstein, and two, excuse me,  The idea that messing with children and doing things like this has become a main tenet of sort of Trump's messaging, of MAGA's messaging.

It's essentially a threat to freeze Russia's lucrative oil exports, and it mirrors Senator Lindsey Graham's legislation that is gaining some momentum on Capitol Hill. Senator Graham touted his bill as another tool available to President Trump to pressure Putin to come to the negotiating table.  This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariff on any country that helps Russia and props up Putin's war machine. He can dial it up or down. He can go to zero to 500. He has maximum flexibility. But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.  All together, this is a significant turn in President Trump's posture toward Ukraine, as he deals with the practical reality that Putin remains a significant impediment to a long-sought peace deal to end the war. Joining me now is our team of superb reporters, NBC News Senior White House Correspondent Garrett Haake,  NBC News Senior National Security Correspondent Courtney Kube and our double chief, Chief Washington and Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell joins me on set. Great to have you here. Let me begin with you, Garrett, if I may. What more did we hear from the president about how he views this different kind of deal regarding weapons for Ukraine?  Well, I think the president here is trying to sort of split the middle here and provide weapons to Ukraine without providing weapons to Ukraine. He had a campaign promise to end this war on day one that obviously went out the window some time ago. But another one that said the U.S. would no longer be funding Ukraine's defense."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 241.133, "text": "Now he's able to allow for Ukraine's defense.  without funding it directly."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 244.979, "text": "And this includes those Patriot missile air defense systems that have been number one on President Zelensky's wish list, if you will, which will be coming from other countries. This is the other kind of benefit for President Trump, who has long talked about the idea that Europe needs to do more for its own defense. Here he gets to say that it's Europe providing these weapons, other NATO countries buying them from the US, and he can tout the superiority of American military hardware, another favorite talking point. From the White House's perspective, this is all a win-win.  And it was notable today, Garrett, that the president talked about the importance of a strong Europe, something we don't always hear from him. And part of that is some of Europe has had its own relationships with Russia over the years. What more do we know about how this could affect energy prices? Certainly, China is a big consumer of that.  Yeah, take a look at Mark Rutte's hand, the NATO Secretary General here, who's been kind of a guide for Donald Trump in dealing with Europe and dealing with NATO. I think you could probably argue pretty successfully to get to this point. The nature of these tariffs as secondary tariffs, not on Russia, a country with which we do little business of any kind right now, but on the other countries that buy their oil and gas, is significant. It's the kind of thing that could potentially raise prices in those countries on these  products and could raise global prices given the global nature of the energy economy here. So if you're China or Iran or another major importer of Russian oil, it might also increase your willingness to lean on Russia to end this war. This is just not the kind of thing that's good for the economies of any of the places in the graphics on your screen, potentially including the United States, which could see prices rise as well, again, given the global nature of the oil markets.  So it ratchets up the pressure, if you will, on Vladimir Putin in a variety of ways to make a deal of some kind and soon.  Thank you so much, Garrett. Let me turn now to our colleague Courtney, and obviously you can give us the picture of what does this announcement mean for the real fighting that's taking place on the ground. So it's symbolic in that the fact that President Trump is providing these weapons to Ukraine, but the reality is there are very few number of actual weapons or systems. They're going to be a game changer on the ground in Ukraine, and patriots are definitely not them.  But they will have the ability once, if in fact there are going to be multiple Patriot batteries brought into Ukraine that will defend against what we have seen are a barrage of Russian attacks in recent weeks. We're talking hundreds of missiles and drones being fired in just a day or just one night, Kelly. These Patriots will have the ability to defend against those, to save Ukrainian civilian lives. And that in and of itself should be enough to help bolster some of the Ukrainian momentum  hopefully, including on the battlefield, is the goal here by NATO to help bolster the fighting there. But the reality is, on a day-to-day basis, it continues to be a war of inches in Ukraine. And defensive systems like this are not likely to be able to push Russian military back in any real way.  and that cadence from Russia has been just alarmingly increased. When you consider the NATO piece of this, do you have any sense of how that will work? Is NATO ready to embrace this fully? NATO absolutely has been embracing this already. And one way that they may look at this weapons, this change, and how the U.S. is going to provide weapons and systems to Ukraine is a U.S. military component there called SAG-U.  It stands for Special, I forgot what the A stands for, Group Ukraine Assistance. That's the A, Special Assistance Group Ukraine. It's a military component that's based in Wiesbaden, Germany, and that's where the U.S. coordinates all of the assistance that they are providing to Ukraine.  NATO already works closely with SAG-U. Kelly, I could see a scenario where they only increase their coordination and cooperation, maybe even NATO taking a leadership role with SAG-U, and that they would be the ones to essentially distribute or coordinate systems moving into Ukraine going forward.

Plus, MAGA mutiny? The president tells his base to cool it amid a revolt against the Justice Department leadership for failing to deliver on conspiracy theories they once amplified, tied to Jeffrey Epstein. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  Welcome back. President Trump's threat of new tariffs on Russia's biggest trading partners comes as he announces new tariffs on the nations the U.S. relies on for major trading relations, including a 30 percent tariff on most imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1st, unless they make a deal. That weekend announcement coming just days after the president threatened 35 percent tariffs on certain Canadian goods, also effective August 1st.  In reaction, the EU is pausing its proposed retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. until August 1st as it looks to continue negotiations toward a trade deal. But at least some EU officials appear skeptical the president will actually make good on these latest threats."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "EU", "Unfair"], "line": 34, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1211.909, "text": " Could I just add that until now, our American friends have achieved one deal and 23 threats. So it makes a lot of sense that those of us who are threatened compare notes, as the commissioner said. And I think we shouldn't underestimate our power."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 35, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1229.611, "text": " They're keeping track. NBC News Senior Business Correspondent Christine Romans joins me now. Anne, help us to put this into everyday terms. When you hear 30 percent tariffs on EU and Mexican imports, what could that look like for American consumers?  I mean, it's a huge new cost in the supply chain for medicines, for pharmaceuticals, for important, you know, highly skilled manufacturing equipment that comes to the United States. You know, French wine and Spanish olive oil and Italian cheese. I mean, just think of all of the different things. This trading relationship is 30 percent of the entire globe's trade is those 27 nations in that block and the United States.  huge. So the worry is it could cause some companies, some industries to have, you know, huge new costs and company and factory closures. It could mean new costs for American consumers. And if there's that retaliation that you talked about that's now on the table, but that retaliation, if it happened, it would really hurt American farmers and brewers and Kentucky bourbon makers and a whole bunch of really important industries that export to the EU.  more of that uncertainty that you've been talking about and helping us understand for months. So when you look at the fact that the EU has, at least for now, delayed its retaliatory tariffs, what is more likely at this point, do you think? Is the EU willing to negotiate or are they expecting President Trump to simply back down?  I mean, they have to keep negotiating. And what we're hearing is that they are indeed still talking. But when you listen to the people close to the president, Kevin Hassett, who is one of his top advisers, saying that they've been working on these deals, but the president is the one in the end,  who can decide what he wants for the American people and who wants more from what some of these countries have been offering. In terms of the EU, it's an incredibly difficult, difficult negotiating bloc. You have the self-interest of 27 different countries, and then you have the trading interests of the bloc itself. So, I mean, it must be very, very interesting to try to be the person or the team negotiating with the U.S. on behalf of 27 different countries.  I suppose it's good they're still talking. One other way we look at this is how seriously are markets taking the latest iteration, the president's threats now? Anything you're seeing there? Taking it in stride, and this is something that we're told is actually bullying the president. The president can see that the markets have not reacted dramatically.  That said, it was the worst first six months for the dollar, I think, in 50 years. So in dollar markets and in bond markets, we have seen sort of the strain. You got Bitcoin at record highs. That's an alternate sort of store of value. So that could very well be all of this controversy and drama has pushed people into Bitcoin, although this administration and this president and his family have been very bullish about Bitcoin and actually in that business. So that could be part of it there. But the Nasdaq at a record high today. So you have  some people who are kind of cautiously looking at this snapback in markets from April, when the president made his first, you know, threats and then paused them, and who are saying maybe the market could be ahead of itself if the president really does come through with these very, very strong and steep tariffs.  Christine, thank you so much. Really appreciate that. I want to turn now to some news that has just been developing, and this comes out of the Supreme Court. We just learned that the high court is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its staffing cuts at the Department of Education. In May, a federal judge blocked the administration from making those drastic cuts to the workforce.  And now in a six to three, so that's the conservative to the liberal bloc ruling along those ideological lines, the court says they can go forward. The White House is looking to lay off more than 1,000 people as part of its effort to dismantle the Department of Education.  And up next, former President Biden speaks out, calling President Trump and other Republicans, quote, liars amid GOP investigations into his clemency decisions and his mental fitness while Mr. Biden was in office. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  Welcome back. President Trump is facing a brewing revolt from his MAGA base after his Justice Department shot down conspiracy theories tied to convicted sex offender, the late Jeffrey Epstein. Conspiracy theories, which the president and multiple top DOJ officials had previously amplified. In a recent memo, the Justice Department said it won't release any more evidence in the Epstein case and reaffirmed that Epstein was not murdered,  died by suicide, and that he did not maintain a client list. Now, that has prompted fury from Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, who has threatened to quit over Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of this matter, and that is according to a source who has spoken with Bongino. Bongino's anger at Bondi and skepticism of the DOJ's conclusions is being echoed by the president's loyal base.  And it was on full display by some of the MAGA's most influential media personalities at a gathering of young conservatives this weekend in Florida."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1552.336, "text": "How many of you are not satisfied with the results of the investigation?

The fact that the US government, the one that I voted for, refused to take my question seriously, and instead said, case closed, shut up conspiracy theorist,  was too much for me. And I don't think the rest of us should be satisfied with that.  President Trump is tamping down on any rift and standing by his attorney general, Pam Bondi, appearing with her this weekend and defending her as, quote, fantastic on social media. Joining me now is NBC News senior national politics reporter Matt Dixon, who's been covering this story for us. And, Matt, glad you are here to help us kind of put this all in perspective.

They had talked about releasing the files, the Epstein files to the extent there are in client lists. And now they're in this moment where they're trying to walk that all back.  But they've created this sort of intensity with their base, and the MAGA movement that Trump created really wants answers on this. And the idea that the carpet has been pulled out from underneath them so abruptly really isn't sitting well with them. Trump has traditionally been very Teflon with his base, where he can have missteps, he can have things they might slightly disagree with, but they always come home. But I can tell you, in the convention center in Tampa this weekend,  It felt different. It felt like this is going to be a little more difficult. And to your point, part of that is, you know, because Trump himself promised so much on this issue and now appears to be walking it back."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 39, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1700.041, "text": "There was definitely a bubbling energy there where you were.

It feels like Bongino could be on the outs. And there was initial reporting that if he left, Patel would leave as well. And there was sort of a rift between those two and Attorney General Pam Bondi. Director Patel has since put out a tweet publicly saying that he is not leaving, he's going to stay with the administration. I think, again, that's sort of  the effort to try to move beyond this moment, even if that might be a little more difficult for the White House. So Bongino is a podcaster, had a large media following, and he is among the people who helped amplify the Epstein stuff. So I think there is some sense he wants to preserve here and wants to make sure that he still has credibility with Trump supporters in the MAGA base when and if he leaves the administration."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 41, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1765.038, "text": " So that credibility question leads me to my next thought. It's not the first time we've seen the president sort of annoy his base. That happened when he engaged in the bombings on Iran, those who didn't want him to be involved in foreign wars.

Does it have more staying power?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 42, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1783.465, "text": " It feels like it.

But being in that room in Tampa I've covered a lot of Trump events. I've covered a lot of conservative conventions. It certainly felt different. And again because Trump built  some credibility with his base on this issue is a main talking point for a very long time. So to the degree that you can put the toothpaste sort of back in the MAGA tube feels like it might be a little more difficult this time, because one, the allegations are terrible that the Epstein, and two, excuse me,  The idea that, you know, messing with children and doing things like this has become a main tenet of sort of Trump's messaging, of MAGA's messaging. So this hits home. This is sort of guttural for a lot of his supporters. So it does feel a little different than, say, a policy fight or an issue over foreign policy.

Option two is they're engaging in a cover-up. So is conspiracy something that Democrats really want to wade into? They often use that as a political weapon against Republicans and certainly MAGA conservatives. Is this a place where Democrats want to be?  You saw two things today. One thing you saw Mark Vesey, who has one of these districts in Texas that the Republicans are wanting to redistrict in a special session, who came to the floor and said, yes, let's make all of this public. Let's jump. And that's a Democrat running right into the middle of this saying, yes, let's just open this up so everybody can see everything, which is a good political move for him. But the second thing is we're moving into  off your election cycles. And you've covered this, and it's all about for everybody at home, off your elections. It's not elections where everybody votes.

And after the break, we're on the ground in Texas, where heavy rainfall and more flooding is threatening recovery efforts as the search for the missing enters its second week. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  We're glad you're back. More rain is hampering recovery efforts in central Texas. The Kerr County Sheriff's Office is ordering all volunteers to leave the river area and move to higher ground because of more threatening weather. That's after as much as 10 inches fell over the weekend, halting efforts to find the more than 100  60 people still unaccounted for after the July 4th flooding. And this all comes as the Trump administration is defending the federal response to the catastrophic floods following the president's visit to the area on Friday. Now, on Meet the Press yesterday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem denied reports that thousands of calls from flood victims to FEMA call centers went unanswered. She also acknowledged and defended a new policy that requires her direct sign-off  on contracts or grants that spend more than $100,000. And that has raised concerns about the pace of aid distribution."}, {"keywords": ["Export"], "line": 64, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2377.364, "text": " It's not extra red tape, it's making sure everything is getting to my level and that it's immediately responded to.

My colleague, NBC News correspondent Ryan Chandler joins me. And Ryan, what is the latest that you are hearing on the search for those from the July 4th flooding? You're on the ground. What are you hearing?  Well, it's more difficult news, Kelly. This is the last thing that Texas needed. This entire central Texas region battered by rain through yesterday and into today, which is stalling the search and rescue efforts here and causing the need for a lot more rescues in other parts. We just heard from Governor Abbott, who increased the total death count for the state. We now know statewide 131 people have died due to flooding, including  of course, most of the deaths here in Kerr County. In Travis County, where Austin is, nine people are dead and three are missing. So that speaks to the urgent need to try and find as many people as possible. We have seen the helicopters, the ground teams working again today after taking most of yesterday off. Kerr County gave the all clear to them to resume their efforts yesterday afternoon. But with more rain, it's been hard to get things in the air and people in the water  This is dangerous work as it is, and this weather is not making it any easier, Kelly. And exhausting and emotionally wrenching certainly work as well. Are you getting a sense that some of the additional changes in the forecast are having really practical impediments for what they're trying to accomplish?  Yeah, absolutely. I'll tell you, we were out with the dive teams a couple days ago watching how they do their work. And they said they're literally trying to look for bodies in muddy water that is far deeper than they are used to. And the problem is with the forecast, even if it's not raining on top of us right now, if it's raining upriver, that's going to come down in the hours ahead. So they are preemptively making sure that they're not in the water as it  rises. We were at the base camp for thousands of volunteers yesterday and it was empty. We saw it a couple days ago. There were people cooking food for first responders, donating trucks and equipment. It was buzzing. It was a little depressing to see it empty because as much as these people want to help, they just couldn't yesterday, Kelly.  You heard we played a clip of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem talking about the administration's response. Certainly the White House and she have been saying it has been an exemplary response. Are you hearing any questions on the ground? What is it that in the community where people are really personally affected by this, are they seeing the speed of the government response as she describes it? Or do they have a different perspective based on the conversations you've had?  I'll tell you, we have seen FEMA workers on the ground collaborating with local, state, and federal resources today. We've seen the FEMA office that has stood up to help anybody who needs to come to them for disaster assistance if maybe their home has been damaged.  To be honest, I've noticed a bit of a disconnect between the ground truth here and the narrative that FEMA has been ineffective. I've been talking to first responders, search and rescue teams, asking them if they are happy with FEMA's resources, and a lot of them tell me,  What are you talking about? We haven't noticed anything different. We have everything that we need, whether that is from FEMA or from neighbors coming out with a chainsaw offering to help. It has been an outpouring of support. I have not heard from anybody who says we don't have enough to do our jobs here.  That's very helpful to gather that kind of on-the-ground perspective. Ryan, thank you so much. Stay safe there. Stay cool if you can. And still to come, there are conflicting reports on the conditions of detainees at a controversial new immigration center that's been called Alligator Alcatraz. We will have reactions from the Democratic and Republican lawmakers who had a tour of that facility this weekend. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  We're glad you're back with us, and we are following a number of developments in connection with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, including a court ruling limiting who ICE agents can arrest in Los Angeles. A federal judge issued that temporary restraining order on Friday, ruling that federal agents have been arresting people based upon their race or their spoken language. The Justice Department says it is appealing the decision.  Also, we're watching that lawmakers are providing drastically different accounts of the conditions inside Florida's new immigration detention facility that's been called Alligator Alcatraz. After a tour of the facility this weekend, Democrats described it as dirty, crowded, and unsanitary, while Republicans describe it as well-run and no squalor.  It comes as NBC News has exclusive new reporting on the conditions inside other detention centers. Immigration advocates tell NBC News that immigrants being held in ICE detention centers in at least seven states are complaining of hunger, food shortages, and spoiled food. A DHS spokesperson said in a statement, quote, any claim that there is a lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.  NBC News Chief Capitol Hill Correspondent Ryan Nobles joins me now. And Ryan, when we talk about a tour of members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, how did that come about? Who are we talking about?  Well, this is a group of Florida, members of the Florida delegation, both Republicans and Democrats, but it was really Democrats that pushed to get access to what's being dubbed Alligator Alcatraz. This was after they were initially denied access to this facility. They ended up getting a tour. They said that it was a limited tour of the facility and what they described were inhumane conditions. They say that the people that are detained in this facility are  packed into cages, as they describe them, as many as 32 people per one of these cells that divide the detainees that are being brought in. They say that it is hot, it is uncomfortable, and it is not the way a federal immigration detention facility should be run.  Obviously, the administration feels very differently about this. They think that this is an appropriate use of taxpayer funds and an appropriate way to run this process as they carry out their mass deportation plans. But obviously, this is a controversy that is just beginning, and Democrats are going to try and highlight it as much as they possibly can going forward.  And their visit, Ryan, seems like it would be instructive because the Homeland Security Secretary said to Kristen Welker, our colleague over the weekend on Meet the Press, that the administration wants to build facilities similar to Alligator Alcatraz in other places. So might this be a fight that plays out from Capitol Hill this fall and in other states?  I mean  full of funding to help support the Trump mass deportation effort. So there's every reason to believe that if the administration wants to create more facilities like this, they're going to have the ability to do it. And there isn't much that Congress can do to stop it. And that there's even much of a will for members of Congress to stop it.  I think it really much more becomes a campaign issue, Kelly, as we head into the 2026 midterms. Democrats are going to point to this as being an example of how the Trump administration has run just roughshod over this immigration policy and that their mass deportation plan goes too far.  When you talk about campaigns, I want to bring up a new Gallup poll that shows that Americans' views on immigration are more favorable now than they were a year ago. A record 79% say immigration is a good thing for the country. That's up 15 points from a year ago. Just 30% say immigration should be decreased compared to 55% a year ago. So should this be a red flag for Republicans that views might be changing?  I mean, if it is, they're showing no signs in that direction, Kelly. Republicans have long believed that immigration is what they call an 80-20 issue for them. They believe that there's nuance in these numbers. And when presented with the way they're going about enforcing immigration, that that likely will be favorable to voters in the upcoming midterms. And we'll end it right there. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate it. We're back tomorrow with more Meet the Press Now. But the news continues with Hallie Jackson right now.

My amendment would have penalized states from giving Medicaid benefits to illegal immigrants who were charged or convicted of serious crimes like murder, human trafficking, child abuse, or child pornography. Forty-three Democrats  voted against that. Turning it the other way around, that means 43 Democrats were for providing government benefits to illegal immigrants who were charged or convicted of very serious crimes. You really can't make this stuff up. It's stranger than fiction.  Our colleagues across the aisle showed their true colors by voting for taxpayers to continue paying for government hands out to folks who shouldn't even be in this country in the first place, but for the open border policies of the Biden administration. One accusation I find particularly ironic from our friends across the aisle has been this idea that we have somehow added red tape  to Medicaid by requiring recipients to verify their eligibility for the program two times a year. Well, people come in and out of the Medicaid program based on that means testing, based on their earnings threshold. So checking periodically to make sure that people still qualify strikes me as making good sense. But when Republicans talk about cutting red tape, we're talking about ways we can get government out of the way.  of our small businesses, our entrepreneurs, so that our economy can grow and so that people can create wealth for themselves and their families and their benefits and their beneficiaries. We're talking about reducing the government's footprint so that the magic of American innovation can take place unstifled by unnecessary regulations.  This bill will allow America to return to being the land of opportunity where hard-working men and women who have a dream for a better life can build a business to support themselves and their families and have something to pass on to the next generation, and at the same time to provide jobs  for people who want to work and provide for their families. So eligibility verification for those receiving means-tested government benefits is not simply red tape. It's a perfectly reasonable requirement when somebody is receiving a government benefit to prove that you actually are eligible according to the law.  This will also help us safeguard our safety net for those who are truly among the most vulnerable and root out waste, fraud, and abuse. There's no evidence that anything  that the bill did or will do will reduce things like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather forecasting. Yet we hear Democrats claiming that somehow this bill was responsible for things like the terrible flooding that occurred in Texas on July the 4th.  There's simply no evidence of that, yet that doesn't stop them and some of the press from parroting these false claims that some of the provisions of the bill, which were just signed on July the 4th, somehow had that effect. No, our Democratic colleagues are simply unreconciled to the fact that last November, voters gave Republicans a mandate  President Trump won the electoral vote, the popular vote, and every single swing state. And Republicans won the majorities in both houses, in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. And passing the big, beautiful bill was an important step in keeping our promises to the American people and advancing President Trump's legislative agenda. But there's more.  In addition to extending President Trump's tax cuts, a critical part of his campaign was to restore security to the US-Mexico border and to end the rampage of criminal activity that went unchecked during the Biden administration. So in addition to spending reforms and tax cuts, the big beautiful bill made good on his promise and my promise and the promise of many of us  to take steps to secure our southern border and to protect and to support once again law enforcement rather than to make it impossible for them to do their job.  In Texas, Governor Abbott and the state spent billions of dollars in something called Operation Lone Star, which is a fill the gap program that the state implemented because the Biden administration refused to secure the border, which is a federal government responsibility. And the federal government should have funded that effort, but did not.  The big beautiful bill includes provisions to reimburse states like Texas for their efforts to do the federal government's job, but one that the federal government simply refused to do under the Biden-Harris administration. I think reimbursement of that funding is only fair, and I'm glad the Senate and the House have now made that a provision of this legislation.  This legislation will also fulfill President Trump's pledge to make our cities and streets safe again through provisions that bolster our nation's border security and law enforcement efforts. Over at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the big, beautiful bill will provide additional funding to hire, retain, and train personnel who will carry out the President's immigration agenda, something that he was elected on  and people repudiated the position of the Biden-Harris administration, which essentially was one of no controls. The hardworking men and women in law enforcement at ICE will receive performance and signing bonuses, as well as recruitment, hiring, and onboarding costs for those personnel. The bill provides resources for ICE and federal law enforcement training  upgrades, as well as fleet modernization. These are important elements of actually enforcing our immigration laws. And it will support enforcement and removal operations so that criminal aliens who've entered the country during the Biden administration can be removed. In addition to the criminals, there are roughly one and a half million people who have pursued some relief  from in the form of asylum who've been denied any sort of relief from the immigration laws and who've been ordered removed from the country but simply stayed in the United States and defied being repatriated. Well, that is now going to change under the Trump administration.  Our bill also allocates funding to the Department of Justice to combat drug trafficking and illegal drug use, as well as to investigate and prosecute crimes related to illegal immigration. These provisions will help keep America safer by shoring up law enforcement across the board to right the wrongs of the previous administration.  During the last four years, Texas, because of our 1,200 mile common border with Mexico, has particularly suffered under President Biden and DHS Secretary Mayorkas' reckless open border policies. This legislation is an important step in correcting the previous administration's costly, and in some cases deadly, errors.  Last November, the voters voted to turn the page on the failed policies of the Biden administration, and passing this bill was a critical step in reversing those policies. This bill will put more money in taxpayers' pockets and allow us to avoid the largest tax increase in American history. It will strengthen our border and support law enforcement.  I was disheartened, disappointed, but not surprised, frankly, that our Democratic colleagues voted to block the bill, preferring instead, I assume, since they offered no viable alternative, to foist that large tax increase on the American people, which would have amounted to a $2.6 trillion tax hike on households earning less than $400,000 a year.  I'm glad they did not prevail, and I'm sure those taxpayers agree. And next April, when tax season rolls around, I'm confident taxpayers will agree and will be thanking the Grand Ole Party for this one big, beautiful bill."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker outlines the main points of the Republican bill, emphasising its focus on eligibility verification for Medicaid, border security, and tax cuts.

You don't throw rocks at vehicles like that and you don't attack them like that unless you are trying to do harm to them physically and to kill them and to take their lives.  We went there because we knew specifically from casework we had built for weeks and weeks and weeks that there was children there that could be trafficked, being exploited, that there was individuals there involved in criminal activity. And we found over a hundred individuals that were involved in that and unaccompanied children there that we had been looking for. Listen, nobody talks about the fact that President Trump has found over 10,000 children that were missing under the Biden administration.  10,000 children that were just lost because they were put into the system and were being exploited either through sex trafficking or work trafficking or were being victimized. And he has found them and brought their perpetrators to justice. We've had over 400 different sponsors of that federal agency that was run by Joe Biden to exploit these children. 400 different people involved in that have been arrested.  and brought to justice. Every single person working for this administration to help us uphold the law should sleep good at night with a peace that passes all understanding that you're doing God's work. Because those poor children will never have to be victimized again by people who just explain it away and say that that shouldn't happen."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker highlights the violence faced by officers, including doxing, physical attacks, and Molotov cocktails.

In May, the President announced Ms. Herman Darfur was the very first judicial nominee of his second term. And now she is the President's first judicial nominee to come to the floor of the Senate. The President has been clear that his primary concern is not about his judicial nominee's experience,  competence, or integrity. This president is not focused on temperament, independence, or respect for the rule of law. He's focused on a nominee's perceived loyalty to him and his agenda, and a willingness to rule in favor of him and his administration. When we consider the president's priorities and Ms. Hermendorfer's record, it's easy to understand why the president nominated her to serve  on the Sixth Circuit. At the office of Tennessee Attorney General, Ms. Hermandorfer leads the Strategic Litigation Unit. Why is that significant? She's not just defending state laws in Tennessee. She's turned the Attorney General's office into an advocacy arm for the Trump agenda. She's argued in support of President Trump's unconstitutional executive order that purports to end birthright citizenship.  This executive order has been blocked by every judge who's considered it. One judge, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, I might add, said, and I quote, I've been on the bench for over four decades. I can't remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order, end of quote. And yet, Ms. Hermandarfer signed amicus briefs in support of that.  and supported the president's unlawful efforts to fire inspectors general and heads of independent agencies. Her record makes it clear that if confirmed, she will continue to enable rather than check an administration that has repeatedly exceeded its authority. Ms. Hermandarfer also refuses to acknowledge that President Trump lost the 2020 election. Let me repeat that. This nominee who seeks a lifetime appointment to the federal bench  when asked the basic question as to whether Donald Trump won or lost the 2020 election, gave the stock answer. She refuses to acknowledge that Donald Trump lost. In response to this simple question, did President Trump lose the 2020 election? All she could say was, quote, President Biden was certified as the winner of the 2020 presidential election and served as the 46th president of the United States, end of quote.  This is the standard response from this administration's nominees seeking positions on the federal bench. It is an embarrassing genuflection before the big lie. The question of who won the 2020 election is not a matter of political opinion. It's a matter of historical fact. The overwhelming majority of my Republican colleagues have correctly recognized that reality.  And we have a right to expect nominees to acknowledge such historic realities as well. Both President Trump's nominees, including Ms. Hermendorfer, have been afraid to admit he lost the 2020 election. Why are they afraid of it? It's a fact. They're afraid because it'll make him angry. He may dump their nominations because of the answer to that question. The fact that she's willing to condone President Trump's false claims further demonstrates a level of partisanship and deference  to this president that is unacceptable for someone seeking a lifetime position on the federal bench. And just in case her political leanings aren't clear enough from her record, Ms. Hermendorfer also has strong ties to a range of right-wing organizations. They include the fabled Federalist Society and the Tinio Network. Tinio Network is a new conservative group funded by Leonard Leo.  and his affiliated organizations. You may have heard the name Leonard Leo recently when President Trump called Mr. Leo a sleazebag, and I quote, membership in such organizations has been a litmus test for years for Republican nominees. It's the secret handshake, my friends. If you belong to the Federalist Society or now this Tenio network, you're in.  It means that a nominee will use the Republican playbook for deciding important federal cases. How does it work? You claim to be neutral. But in fact, you contort history and overturn precedents to reach the Republican preferred outcome. Ms. Herman Darfur has followed this playbook to a T in the Tennessee Attorney General's office. She's opposed LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights, as well as environmental and anti-discriminatory  discrimination policies that protect the most vulnerable in America. I believe we need judges on the bench who will follow the law and the Constitution, not politicians in robes who rule in favor of the president and wealthy special interests. Finally, I'd like to note that Ms. Hermandarter's academic record, though impressive, and her legal record, though extreme, is short. She graduated from law school in 2015.  has fewer than 10 years legal experience. And outside of her clerkships, she's only practiced law for six years, and she's seeking a lifetime appointment to a circuit court, one of the highest in the land. She's never served as sole or chief counsel in any case, any case, tried to verdict, judgment, or final decision. That is a shocking lack of experience for someone nominated for a lifetime position. She'll be watching trials for the first time  As a judge, unfortunately this kind of experience is common among President Trump's judicial nominees. Make no mistake, experience is still important. Robust litigation experience ensures that judicial nominees will be equipped to fulfill their duties. As an appellate judge, she's going to be standing in judgment of many trial courts. She has limited experience in that field.  Ms. Hermendorfer is the first judicial nominee we've considered this Congress. She won't be the last. In every instance, we must carefully examine the nominee's record as we consider them for a lifetime appointment. After carefully reviewing her record, I have serious concerns. I think my colleagues, if they look at her honestly, will as well. I urge them to join me in opposing her nomination."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker argues that Whitney Herman Darfur is unfit for a lifetime appointment on the federal bench due to her loyalty to President Trump, her advocacy for his unconstitutional policies, and her lack of experience.

I think two things. First, I think slightly different about the conditions. We have an amendment to our constitution which speaks to cruel and unusual punishment, but really speaks to fines and the kinds of hurdles you can make it for everyday people to be able to appeal decisions. And then there's a part of it that speaks to the wanton treatment that, or careless treatment that some may,  impose on those in detention or prisons. I don't know the case. I listen to the congressman. We'll have to see. If someone brings a case, the court will make that determination. For me, the issue still remains, because I support what Mr. Homan is doing as it relates to the worst and first. Those cases, those examples you gave, Jessie, I agree with, and I think I'm with the 70% of Americans who say that you got to take those guys out first, men and women, assuming that they're mostly men.  But then you get to the part about the hierarchy of deportations and the people that are in our communities, people who run businesses, who work in businesses that many of us consider central to our daily lives. I'm sensitive to what Greg talked about in terms of, and you've talked about it too, the inflation of wages and how we are, all this deflationary pressure because we're hiring people and we're not paying them what we might pay a citizen. I contend that there are a lot of people working in the economy who we are paying,  normal wages. I contend there are a lot of people who just are not citizens, who have become part of our culture and part of our society. I read this story over the weekend in one of the national papers about a fellow out of Arkansas who was against illegal immigration and wants strong border security. He met a woman online. She happened to be illegal. She lived in another state.  She ran her own business, then worked in a restaurant. He drove to get her, brought her back to Arkansas. You know what he's doing? He's so committed there, he's leaving the country. He's gonna go to El Salvador with her so she can get in line. That's more than true love. I admire what that guy's doing, but he also makes a point in the article that we need to have a better system of how people become citizens, particularly people who are following the rules. I think that's where the country, as you look at the polling data on President Trump, it's moving a little bit, saying they don't,  fully approve of all that's happening right now. They want the worst first out, but they're not clear on some of the other things.

I'd like to dedicate my segment to Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her comments. So during the Biden administration, during those years, they were sued over the conditions that the minors, the illegal immigrant minors were in, right? They were eating bloody chicken. They were urinating in plastic bags. They were on suicide watch.  cutting themselves with their ID cards, and she was radio silent the entire time. In fact, what I heard from her in March of 2023 was saying to the world that fentanyl was actually being trafficked through legal ports of entry by Americans, and then she went on  to criticize Governor DeSantis' legislation proposed that would impose stricter penalties on human traffickers because, she said, in the typical racist tropes of the Democrat Party, she said, you're going to have vegetables rotting in the fields. You're going to have construction sites that will lie dormant. Tourism and the restaurant industry in particular rely on these workers, to Greg's point, instead of lifting up  those workers and say, look, cheap labor should not be part and parcel to the fabric of our society. In fact, it's morally wrong. And here, let me propose legislation to get these guys actually accurate pay and all the things. None of that. So now she says, you brush your teeth where you go to the bathroom. Same thing. I don't know one. I mean, I don't know. I've never been to a billionaire's house that has separate from that. So welcome to the USA. And it reminds me of a case I worked on in California.  where an inmate who liked to have sex with babies, which was why he was incarcerated, complained about his hip and wanted special accommodations for the hip pain. And here's all the things that I need. And all of us sitting there listening to him essentially said, you know what? I can't muster up even one care right now. And if I did, that care would be reserved for  homeless veterans, or military service people who are living in moldy conditions, or maybe the victims of these illegal immigrants who didn't even get a shot at life. So save it, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, because I think there's a lot more cares that Americans have before they start caring about her talking about brushing your teeth or they poop right now.

Or, you know, go after Fetterman. Go after somebody. The media will gobble that up. Or you go after some foreign leader. Take an axe to chi or go after the cartels or something.

Should I double down on trans dudes in women's sports? Should I back the attacks on ICE? Should I show courage on those things? No, it won't work. As for Mark Cuban, I don't know why he doesn't apply the same mentality that he uses on Shark Tank with Democrats, you know, because that was what was great about Trump is that, you know, he forced  the party to react to him. And it's like Cuban just dropped his whole common sense when it came to the Democratic Party. He should imagine the Democratic Party showing up in Shark Tank, you know, hello sharks, I want 100% investment.

So he gives a message that's like any of us could say, yeah, toughen up. It's not really great advice. It reminds me of when Biden and Harris told Putin not to invade Ukraine. They said don't.  They said, if you're thinking of crossing the border illegally, don't. And none of that mattered. The other messages that the Democrats have received lately are not only just get tough, curse more, make a stupid video, or get shot. That was the advice last week. That would be one way to toughen up, I suppose. But the one thing that you mentioned, how Trump made the party react to him, what Democrat right now is making  other fellow Democrats do that?

In 2021, the first year of Joe Biden's administration, President Trump's popularity rating took a little bit of a hit because of some things that happened in the beginning of the year, and he reemerged. So I don't, I understand where we're going, but I look at it this way. I take Mark Cuban at his word. We do need new ideas, you're right. He should approach it the way he does on that show. We did innovation in our approaches.  plans for the future, actionable plans for the future. We should be willing, as we spell out these ideas, to give Trump credit where credit is due. What he's done on the border has shown us that had we changed our mind and been able to change Ms. Harris's mind or Mr. Biden's mind about what they should have been doing, we might have had a different outcome. The same is true with what we did in Iran.  helping to eliminate or obliterate or set back their nuclear program was a good thing. But Democrats, get out and point to Mr. Trump. You said that over the last four years, DEI had ruined our military. For 24 years, they've been planning, figuring out ways to go after those mountains, and they did it, even with DEI.  Say to the president, you are right. We welcome you in wanting to send arms and munitions to continue the things that Dems and Republicans have done for Mr. Zelensky. But say, why wait 50 days? There's no need to wait 50 days to let Russia come around. Put the hammer down on him even sooner. I'd invite the housing secretary to my district if I were in Congress, saying, you know what? I've identified three areas that the federal government owns and the city owns and the state owns. We can do affordable housing here. Let's figure out how we reduce the regulations to make that happen.  I'd say to those who the President wants to make no taxes on tips, if you're a teacher or a nurse and you earn $85,000 a year and there's someone in your area that earns $85,000 a year mainly on tips, why should they get the tax break and you don't? Democrats introduced legislation to cure that. That's what  what Cuban should be saying, I think what he's trying to say, but I don't disagree with you about what President Obama said. Saying that in the confines of a billionaire's home is very different than getting out and saying where people live, who are working every day to raise their kids, keep their neighborhoods safe, et cetera.

Basically, we're sending the weapons and the Europeans are going to pay for them. Ukraine will be rearmed in a significant way, and perhaps that will finally bring Putin to the negotiating table. Putin made a big mistake trying to play Donald Trump. He can't do it.  After three or four ceasefire-related phone calls, or who knows how many, Putin then goes back and starts bombing Ukraine's civilians. That's an absolute no-go for Mr. Trump.

Anyway, Trump made it absolutely clear that he wants the war to stop and that he inherited Joe Biden's war. Trump believes, and I'm sure he's right, that Putin just waited for Biden to come into office and then he invaded Ukraine.  Certainly Biden's decision to flee from Afghanistan had a lot to do with Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. And we can all remember how pathetic Biden's response was as hundreds of thousands of Russian troops amassed on the eastern border of Ukraine when Biden then said, and I'm going to quote, don't end quote, don't.  which, as one wag put it, is what you say to your dog who's pulling a sock away. Don't didn't stop Putin, and nothing else Biden did stop Putin. And Biden's appeasement with Iran didn't stop Putin, nor his appeasement with China.  Trump is really the first president since Ronald Reagan with an effort to check Russia and its grandiose empire ambitions. Mr. Trump also announced a 100% secondary tariff on Russia, but not for 50 days. Personally, I think it should be a much shorter period.  Also impressive was NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, a former conservative prime minister of the Netherlands and a Trump friend and ally. But even more than that, the NATO countries agreed with President Trump to seek defense spending of 5% of GDP, which will send a strong, tough message to Vladimir Putin's phony ambitions. More than any time I can remember, the US is now working in tandem with Europe.  Now there will always be differences, of course. But interestingly, in response to a question on tariffs, Mr. Trump reiterated his 30% EU tariff proposal, but clearly suggested that it was a work in progress and trade negotiations are continuing. By the by, both the stock market and the dollar rallied over the course of the Trump-Ruta press conference.  More than anything, Mr. Trump wants peace, not war. He tried to negotiate with Putin, but it didn't work out. He has inherited a war that would never have happened if Joe Biden were any kind of a strong president. But Biden was a weakling, an appeaser. And Trump has to pick up the pieces and end this Russian problem.  If the United States and the NATO countries of Europe do act in concert, new weapons and all, it will mark the first major show of strength against the dictator Vladimir Putin.

And that was that no longer is the American taxpayer going to foot the bill for traditional security and defense of Europe.  You know, for 76 years, American presidents have been talking about that. Donald Trump delivered it last month. And now the next step is to make Europe pay for the defense and the support of Ukraine, which Joe Biden and, you know, some members of Congress decided that the U.S. taxpayer and the hardworking Americans should be paying for that.  Obviously, America makes the best weapons, and everyone wants them. And Ukraine, to defend themselves, President Trump's been clear, they should get access to U.S. weapons. And so Europe has come through the NATO structure and said, we'll put up the money, we'll buy these American weapons, and we'll send them to Ukraine to defend themselves.  Now, there is already a lot of support for Ukraine happening, and weapons are constantly moving, and that's anything from Patriot missiles, which you mentioned, to things like just ammunition and other types of armaments. But this idea that President Trump has put together and brokered, I think really is a big win for Ukraine.  Ukraine to defend itself, but it's also a big win for the American taxpayer.

It's really hard to compete in the private market when you've got an NFIP.  and even have those conversations with Congress about how do we reauthorize this program, make sure it doesn't go bankrupt and these type of pieces.

The Clarity Act, aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for crypto. The Genius Act, stable coin regulation bill, which the Senate passed last month. And the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, proposed legislation aimed at preventing the Fed from issuing a retail central bank digital currency.  The goal of that bill? To limit potential government surveillance capabilities. Meantime, some House Democrats have chosen their own nickname for this week, Anti-Crypto Corruption Week. Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee pointed to President Trump's quote, meme coin scam. Ranking member Maxine Waters and other committee Democrats are calling on lawmakers to vote no on the Clarity and Genius Acts, which they claim give the president the green light to continue crypto dealings in his name.

And you know this is a moment where  It's been a long time since you've actually had an upgrade to the financial system to the very nature of what electronic money is. And digital currency really represents that. And you know we're as I like to say still in the very early days of this. And so we think about just like Treasury Secretary Besson talks about trillions of dollars of stable coins in the coming years.  major investment banks and others looking at trillions of dollars to stable coins. We can imagine a world where stable coin money is the primary way that transactions happen on the Internet.

The founder of the Tron blockchain made the announcement on X last week, adding that the Trump-linked digital coins will soon be tradable on Tron.

I think there's a couple of points to make here, which is that we are seeing the emergence of a new category of companies. And it's really rare to find oneself at the onset of that. And so we're pretty fortunate to have really leaned in early as investors in this space of digital asset treasuries, and now getting the recognition for some of these investments in the public markets.  As we think about, you know, why we wanted to participate in these in particular, you know, we really like, as investors in blockchain assets for some time, we are big proponents of the large blockchains like Bitcoin, like Ethereum and like Solana. And it's always made sense to us that there could be, if MicroStrategy can succeed in having that playbook in Bitcoin, there can be others as well.

We'd seen micro strategy work for a few years in the U.S. and then we saw MetaPlanet be a great success in Japan. And there are a few others across the world, but none that really took off in a very big way.  And so when we were first approached by a Solana team that was looking to do something like MicroStrategy was doing, but except a Bitcoin, they're doing it with Solana. I thought that was very interesting. As a firm, we've been very excited and bullish on Solana's prospects as a large generalized contract blockchain that others will use. And so Solana has actually been the second largest position at Pantera for a long time, just behind Bitcoin. And so when someone came to us saying, we're going to tap the US capital markets, the  the, the, the, the excitement, the creativity, the financial engineering that exists in the U S in tandem with pairing that with Solana, a token that we are very excited about on an underlying basis. We thought, look, this is a really interesting time to try to lean in and see if the experiment works. This experiment of creating additional treasury, digital asset treasury beyond just micro strategy. And it worked to our, you know, to our pleasant surprise based on our underwriting, our underwriting played out. And then that's why we also leaned in with, with Cantor equity partners when  Cantor approached us about having the Tether and SoftBank collective come together to create a competitive micro strategy. I just thought, wow, that makes a lot of sense, just as much sense as the Solano loan that we just backed. And so we really helped anchor that deal as an outside investor. And then from there, it just became this explosion, this almost big bang like event where all of a sudden everyone saw the success of DeFi DevCorp.  of canter equity partners, or 21 as it will be renamed. And really a lot of teams started coming to market. And so it's become a much larger and more, more boolean trend than perhaps I might've thought when we first started. In the last three months, I've now taken 70 to 80 pitches of teams trying to do this. Now, naturally, when you see something like that, it's very normal or very reasonable to say that, you know, excess returns invites competition, competition drives down returns. And so eventually,  there will be some successes that I think are really big outcomes, but there will also be plenty of failures, just like there is with any startup universe, as there is always creative destruction. And so of those 70 pitches, we've done now six investments in the space that we're all pretty excited about, and we're continuing to think about and evaluate more."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 565.563, "text": " How far down the spectrum of crypto assets do you see this going?

And  And I think that's probably how it all shakes out today. There's a lot more than that. And I expect there to be many more that launched and maybe not the leaders today. We'll be the leaders of tomorrow. We'll see how that plays out. As we go down the token spectrum though, as I think about what really works or why these work, you really have to have a traditional investor buy-in, right? Institutional investor buy-in to get to scale.  I think there are a lot of teams that are playing for different outcomes. Some teams are playing for that micro strategy like outcome. There are some teams that are playing for a smaller outcome. I think for smaller outcomes, it doesn't matter as much, but like that's less interesting to us. For the bigger outcomes, you really need to hit certain thresholds of market cap before institutional investors take you seriously.  in order to really tap the convertible debt market, you probably need a billion dollar public float company. And when you think about that, there's really only so many tokens that can support a billion dollar digital asset treasury company. If the token itself doesn't have a large market cap, it's not going to support it. And so when I think about that, it probably means you're looking at the top 10, 15 tokens that really have enough practical market cap to support something like this. And then from a  From an acceptance perspective, a big part of the thesis here is that you have to have strong belief by a lot of people in the long-term trajectory of this token, not just from crypto natives, but from broader traditional investors. And there are only so many tokens that have that really broad appeal. Clearly, Bitcoin, Solana, and ETH do. There are certainly a few others that have very, very broad appeal, whether it's stuff like Ripple or Cardano or Doge that have just been around for so long that people know about them.  that I think those have a shot at really making it.

And it's a case that I think actually is representative of what central banks are doing with gold. And we talked about this, that gold is actually a bigger reserve in the ECB than the euro is. So central banks, I'm not so sure ready, but I do think  We've said this all along also, the more regulation you have around Bitcoin and around the infrastructure and the infancy is what gives a green light to institutional investors. And make it clear, this is institutional investors that are doing this. And these ancillary plays, like I'm long Coinbase, it's hard for me to justify the valuation, but it's not just the on-ramp. I think base is a major infrastructure platform for cryptocurrencies. I do think there are dynamics here that will continue.  This would not be happening if the markets were not at all time highs.

We've had an effective tariff rate that's gained year-to-date by about 10 percent, a little bit more.  Even if the president, we don't expect him to put all of this on. We expect some deals to be made. But even if the president puts all of these on, it's just an increase of 2% in the effective tariff rate. So it's not that big of an increase in taxes.

I mean, we saw the dollar go down when stocks were going down. We saw the dollar go down when stocks were going up. I think what that reflects is global investors who have become probably over-allocated to U.S. assets are realizing that they don't want to sell the underlying U.S. assets themselves. They don't want to sell the S&P. They don't want to sell Treasuries, still deep liquid markets.  But they are saying, okay, some of these correlations are changing. The dollar's not quite acting like the safe haven it has in the past, and so maybe what I need to be doing is hedging that dollar exposure, selling dollars forward, and I think that's why the dollar's continuing to decline. That, in the meantime, is helping U.S. corporations because, you know, when they convert that weaker dollar, their foreign revenues look better.  Let me ask you about this rally. How much of it is predicated on the hope or expectation of the Fed cutting, and how much? I don't think that the Fed cutting makes that much of a difference, because I think the more the Fed is cutting, it's based on them viewing the economy being weaker and weaker. In the end, I'd much rather see an economy that is holding up OK,  Right? And the Fed has to do less than the other way around, where the Fed is easing aggressively because the labor market is breaking. So as long as, you know, the Fed cutting once or twice would be helpful, but I don't think it's absolutely necessary. I think you have enough tailwinds for earnings coming in the next year.

The top five six seven banks control 85 90 percent of the assets and the smaller banks control the rest.  And that's further out, 10 years, let's say.

Yesterday, July 13th, marked one year since the tragedy that struck my hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman nearly assassinated President Trump. Tragically, he took the life of Corey Competore and seriously wounded David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Yesterday, I returned to the Butler Farm Showgrounds  where I was with the President a year ago. I met with the Comptatore family during a celebration of Corey's life. They are incredibly strong, and I know all of us on stage continue to send our thoughts and prayers to them as we seek more answers about what actually happened that day. Now, we're here today to highlight  new resolution H.R. 571, which formally recognized the events of 2014 and July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. The resolution also condemns the rise in political violence we have seen across our nation over the last year.  from the assassination attempts against President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida, to the attacks against Governor Josh Shapiro in April, and to the deadly attacks on the Minnesota state lawmakers just last month. Let's be clear. We must stand up together to oppose violence against our nation's leaders all across each party. And I want to thank my co-lead on the resolution  RSC Chairman August Lugar from Texas. When we talk about this, though, we can have as many resolutions as we want to bring it forward. And I've heard person after person, politician after politician, get up and say, I am absolutely appalled by the violence that's taking place in this country today. And we've got to stop using that type of language. And with 24 hours, they're out talking again about who should not be sitting in certain offices.  So it's one thing to have a resolution. It's one thing to be resolved the fact we're not going to keep talking like this. What I'm asking all our Congress, everybody that's in the Congress, everybody that's in elected office, please watch what you say. Don't start off saying we should never do this and then within 24 hours go out and make statements again that incite people. That's a false lead. It's a false premise. Our resolution is an attempt to get people to speak  the way they should speak. In America, the way we settle things is by votes. So it's my pleasure to be with all these people behind me today because they're all feeling the same way. And, uh, I'm going to introduce Dan Muser now. Dan and I sat beside each other in Butler July 13th last year and watched as the assassination attempt took place. I got to tell you at first,  Nobody knew what was happening. It sounded like somebody was shooting off firecrackers. And then, when we saw the president go down, we knew exactly what happened. We did not know that Cory Compitore had been seriously wounded and was going to die. We did not know the two other gentlemen were seriously wounded and are still recovering from those wounds. But today, we are making an effort to make sure that we start speaking the right way in America. Mr. Muser.

As he stated, I was at Butler on the July 13th, and we were there in October when our president insisted on going back. He asked me, what do you think about me going back? And I said, Mr. President, I advise against it. I was not supportive. I was more concerned about his safety.  But his level of courage is, well, boundless. When the president was hit on July 13th, we all couldn't help but really think the worst. But that certainly changed, as we all saw. At the moment, he lifted up security agents on his back.  put his fist up, said, fight, fight, fight, wiping blood from his face. And in so doing, he lifted everybody in that arena up, at the rally up. They began the chant of USA, USA. And I think he rose the entire nation up. And I think we saw that on the following November 5th.  Uh, but the rhetoric, rhetoric and politics is, is out of control, right? I recently met with, uh, members of the indivisible group and up in my district insisting I show up, insisting I show up. Well, we had an hour meeting. I let it go to an hour and 40 minutes, but right at the very end, they said, uh, one of them said, you know, you're, you're, you're a Nazi. And so, so it was president Trump. Okay. Nazi. All right. We know what the Nazis did when people were out there making such comments and elected officials.  You know, some people believe them. They actually think that you might be that, and that hate-speak turns into violence. Just this weekend, Vice President J.D. Vance and his family were at Disney World, cursed at, all kinds of foul language thrown at them, and Governor Newsom has to put something out saying, did you enjoy your time at Disney World, okay?  Governor Newsom is sick to do something like that and to act that way. And how about the ICE agents being demonized and attacked for doing their jobs? And elected officials are out there cheering it on. So there are too many Democrats, frankly, that are tolerating this, in fact, encouraging it. Not all, not all by any means. My friends that are Democrats condemn it as well. But there's too many falsehoods. And we've got a governor in Pennsylvania that does nothing but skew falsehoods.  And again, people believe him, how certain measures are being taken that we're taking food out of hungry Pennsylvanians' mouths. Nothing could be further from the truth. And Brooke Rollins came up to Pennsylvania and pointed out the truth. So we have this resolution. It's about hate speech.  uh, cause hate speech leads to violence. It's dangerous. Uh, we also are seeing a high level of a surge in antisemitic rhetoric. I mean, for crying out loud, I put out a post recently on Facebook, uh, something positive about Israel. I literally got hundreds of, of, of, uh, basically threats and, and all kinds of other, uh, hate, uh, messages. So look, we, um, we're not going to stop at all, but this resolution is about,  calling for an end to hateful rhetoric. Uh, it is about a resolution that somberly, somberly making, uh, answering or, or a, uh, recognizing the one year anniversary of the attack on president Donald J. Trump at honors Corey Compertor, who died shielding his family and David Dutch and James Compa Haver who are, who are injured. And it also brings out, uh, the governor I just mentioned, uh, Josh Shapiro and some others,  that had, we had our governor residents attacked, okay? All of these things need to be condemned, and that's what this resolution is about, and I just applaud my good friend, August Pfluger, and my great friend, Mike Kelly, for setting all this up.

One year ago,  Our nation witnessed a horrific act of violence, the attempted assassination of President Donald J. Trump. It was an attack on our president, on the families that were gathered there to hear him speak, and on the institutions that hold our democracy together.  As a member of the bipartisan task force on the assassination attempt, I joined my colleagues to ask the hard questions. How did this happen? And what can we do to make sure that it never happens again?  Our final report laid out clear recommendations, and since then, Congress has acted, improving threat detection systems, strengthening agency coordination, and expanding protections for officials. The Secret Service has also responded by updating its threat modeling and improving interagency protocols. But important questions remain, and so does our responsibility.  I want to thank Chairman Kelly and Chairman Pfluger for introducing the resolution. It rightly honors the bravery of those who responded. It remembers Corey Comparatore, who gave his life to protect his family, and uplifts the heroism that saved others.  But this resolution is more than a remembrance. It is a call to action. Threats and attacks, whether against the president, a judge, a member of Congress, or ICE agents, are unacceptable.  And to those who would commit these types of acts of violence, know this, the full force of federal law enforcement will find you, will stop you, and will hold you accountable under law. Political violence has no place in America, and we must do everything in our power together to ensure that it never happens again.

It was just a year ago yesterday that President Trump was in a rural Pennsylvania field, bucolic area, beautiful part of this country, when a deranged gunman tried to murder him. At the time, there were thousands of his supporters in the field looking for a message of hope from the president.  A message that the forgotten Americans in this country will no longer be forgotten. That the people who have been ravaged by globalism and mass migration and fentanyl will have a champion in Washington. And meanwhile, leftists on the other side of the aisle were slandering that same then presidential candidate.  saying that he is a threat to democracy, that he's a wannabe dictator, that he is literally Hitler in their words. And some people on their side of the aisle take those words at face value. And they tried to assassinate him.  Political violence has absolutely no place in this country, but unfortunately, this kind of rhetoric has continued. We hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle demonizing the brave men and women who serve in ICE and in immigration facilities, saying that what they are doing is similar to the secret police, that they are being compared to the Gestapo.  This is rhetoric that is not only deranged and wrong, but it has no place in a functioning democratic system. So we on this side of the aisle, and we hope that others will join us, reject this rhetoric. We reject political violence in all its forms. And we pray for this country and for its leaders and for our president for their safety  and for their well-being. So with that said, thank you all for being here.

We've all joined together to denounce hate speech, political hate speech that has deadly consequences. A year ago, the world was outraged after they saw President Trump shot at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and we still mourn the life of Cory Komprator and pray for his family, as well as the other victims that were shot. However, this is just another type of violence that goes on  and on and on, whether it's state legislators in Minnesota, Governor Shapiro in Pennsylvania, or even me being one of the biggest targets of death threats in Congress, as well as my colleagues standing here with me, I'll receive them.  This is a very serious situation, and it happens in many ways. It happens in the headlines. It happens in news clips. It happens in social media posts. It happens in campaign literature and e-mails. And it happens in rhetoric going across the aisle between Republicans and Democrats.  There is no place for political violence. And the people that suffer the most are people like Corey Compertor and his family. It's also a major strain on our Capitol Police. And if you talk to Capitol Police, I encourage you press to talk to them.  They are dealing with a massive amount of death threats for members of Congress, and they have limited resources. We would love to see their resources used here at the Capitol for visitors and safety for everyone.  However, they are constantly having to investigate death threats that come from me and other members of Congress. Over the break, I spent time talking with the FBI about someone that delivered a syringe in my mailbox and talked with them about other cases. And there's been multiple people convicted for pleading guilty to planning to kill me.  But this goes across the aisle on both ways, and I think I'm really grateful to be standing here with my colleagues that are saying enough of this. And I'd also, I can't go without saying that God saved President Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania. God saved him, and he knows it, and he says it frequently all the time, and the American people know it. And we're very grateful for that.

And you know, it has been one year since they tried to kill our president. And I want to take just a quick moment to focus on what I call consequences and make two quick points. You know, the culture of lawlessness and violence, this didn't just start last year.  Y'all, this started under the Obama administration when they decided to illegally investigate conservative groups, when they were out there demonizing Republicans who just simply wanted to follow the Constitution and make our country better. Then you fast forward to the Biden administration, who they put this on steroids and actually allowed the public to take part in this game.  Example, Summer of Love, where rioters were out there burning police stations, assaulting officers, taking over our cities, where they were advocating to defund the men and women in blue who protect us. And they didn't just encourage it, y'all, they promoted it. Hey, they even paid for their bail. The other thing I want to make a point is, and I think Representative Green hit the nail on the head, y'all, we got a morality problem in this country.  There's no value to the sanctity of life anymore. Socialists, woke politicians, they want to have people to look to the government for every answer they need. That's not what we, we, we don't look to the government. We're supposed to look towards God for our, for our answers. What happened in Butler? That's an example, an example of the consequences of this Democrat rhetoric.  Well, you know what? I thank the good Lord for protecting President Trump. And I pray that we get back to the foundations of our country. With that, I'd like to call up Max Miller from the great state of Ohio."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1010.914, "text": "Thank you. It's great to be with all of you this afternoon. On Saturday, I woke up  And the first thing that I did is I called President Trump. Because I remember on that day just a year ago, I had called him that morning for a discussion, right before he went to that rally. And it was very sobering for me.  And he said, you know, hey, Maxie, how's it going? I said, going well, Mr. President. She said, can I help you? I said, no. I said, thank you. Thank you for fighting and thank you for being here. Because on that day, that could have altered the trajectory of this entire country of where we are. President Trump is our 47th president. If that gentleman would have been successful, I don't know where we would have been today.  And honestly, I don't care because he's still standing and he is our president. And when you talk about political violence throughout this country and rhetoric and what it ensues, I know all of my colleagues have experienced it. I myself, just a few weeks ago, got ran off the road.  because some individual wanted to get my attention and he couldn't and he decided to use his vehicle as a weapon. This legislation should be bipartisan in its nature and it should be pushed through without question. And enough is enough. You have an issue with your city councilman, your mayor, your legislator, your governor, your Senator, call them and set up a meeting. And if they're not, hold them accountable because I can tell you that we answer phone calls and emails and messages from our office.  every single day that we are here and not here, because that is our job as a representative for each and every single one of our districts. But what should not be forgotten is what could have happened on that day and where we would have been. And thank God President Trump is here. Thank God he is addressing political violence. But I'm sick of it. I myself have experienced it. My family has now been put, you know, right in harm's way. And enough is enough. And it's not just on members of Congress.  It's also on our constituents with the quorum and just to behave with respect. Yes, you know, we do set an example for the American people to see, but it's not just on us to carry out that example. It's for everyone within our districts who is a loving father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, you name it, cousin, uncle. It is on all of us as a community to come together and just put your weapons down and say enough is enough and just politely disagree over political rhetoric. Because I can tell you one thing,  It wasn't worth it for that gentleman who tried to take out President Trump, and it wasn't worth it for that gentleman who tried to run me off the road. Consequences have actions, and you will see swift action being taken against anybody who harms any publicly elected official or any constituent. So thank you very much. It's my honor to introduce a great Texan, Roger Williams.  One year ago, as we've talked about, a violent and deranged terrorist set out to change the course of American history by attempting to assassinate President Trump. God spared his life for a reason. Moments after bullets intended to kill him miraculously grazed his ear, President Trump stood and commanded the American people to fight, fight, fight. A renewed spirit of American strength and determination was unleashed that day. Now more than ever, we must work to uphold the values that this country is built on as we usher in the golden age  of national security, economic prosperity, transparency, and peace through strength. President Trump has put everything on the line. He's put his name, his freedom, his legacy, because he believes in America. He works tirelessly every single day to put the American people first. Let me be clear. Political violence, as we've talked about, has no place in our country. Evil will not prevail. We are one nation under God. And let us honor the victims that faithful day by restoring American legacy that future generations are proud of.  Now, in my lifetime, there's three things that come to mind as I stood up here. I was one of the last people to shake the hands of John Kennedy on November 22nd, 1963, as a 15-year-old. I shook his hand at 1046 in the morning. At 1246, he was assassinated. I remember that like it was yesterday. Rhetoric. Rhetoric brought that to be. I also remember the baseball shooting. Some of you may remember that. Many of us, our lives were changed that day because of rhetoric.  And I remember that day, everybody wanted to pray for us and offer thanks or offer their prayers. But it wasn't 24 hours later, and Mike, you touched on this, 24 hours later, we were back to where enemies were enemies. And I remember my daughters, two daughters, went to the mailbox several weeks, well, several months ago now, and opened up two letters, each one addressed to them, and had urine, blood, and feces in them.  in the envelopes, and it said, this will be on your father's tombstone. That's tough stuff. It's got to stop. Mike Kelly, Pfluger, and the rest of us believe now is the time to make that happen. So let's keep America great. Let's again pray for President Trump, pray for his safety, and all my colleagues' safety. In God we trust.  Thank you, Mike and August, for having this event today to just remind us all that, you know, despite what happened a year ago to President Trump, and I believe that the Lord spared President Trump's life in that field there in Butler, Pennsylvania. But in spite of that, he remained in the presidential race. He carried on because of his love for our country and the encouragement of the American people. Sadly, we have reached a point in political discourse in this country  where President Trump and every politician must have the courage to speak our political beliefs while knowing that at any point, our lives can be in danger. Just like we saw in Minnesota, just like Congressman Miller mentioned, I too had, uh, was met on an airplane, uh, met by the police because there was a deranged man who was a former San Francisco police officer that was in Fort Wayne, Indiana, looking for me. And I know that every one of us probably have a story similar to that. And I remember, um, Congressman Kelly back in 2010,  during the Tea Party election. Passions were high, but we didn't see the hate speech and the political violence that we see today. We have got to stop it on both sides. In fact, I know every one of us up here would always condemn anybody on our side of the aisle that was performing a political  And I believe that the left needs to do the same thing. That they need to condemn political violence. They need to condemn hate speech. Just as much as what we do.  Their side continues to behave differently. And heaven forbid that it happens from either side. But we continue to see it coming from the left side of the aisle. But I tell you what, as Americans, we have a great opportunity. As we elect our leaders, we need to continue to make sure that we as leaders are responsible in our rhetoric.  But I just appreciate President Trump standing up, even though he was almost killed that day, that he continued to fight, fight, fight for Americans, and standing for not only our democracy, but for our Constitution and our great republic. So Mike, thank you for leading this today, and I'll turn it back over to you. Thank you. So you've heard from us. I want to share something with you that has nothing to do with a political entity.  I was at the Celebration of Life with the Comptor family yesterday. Just for a moment, step out of whom you are and think about them. On the morning, Cory, his wife Helen, his two daughters were so excited to be able to travel a short distance to the Butler Farm Show  to see president Trump speak. This was Corey's idol. This is Helen's idol. This was the girl's idol. They just couldn't wait to get to Butler to see president Trump. The four of them get in their car. They make their way over. It's like 97 degrees that day. Okay. So it's not pleasant. It's a warm day. And what was even warmer was the crowd that was there to greet our president.  And what I want you to think about, especially of those of you who've lost somebody, a father, a mother, two daughters go to an event. It's not supposed to be event about anger. It's not about event to anything other than they're going to see their favorite president.  They actually were not sitting in the seats that they were assigned. There was an opening at the top that they went up to. Shots rang out. Corey Comptor's first reaction was to get his wife and his daughters down so he could be over the top of them. What they didn't realize was that Corey had already been shot.  That day is a day that lives in their memories. It's in their sleep. It's in their waking hours. This has nothing to do with politics. This has to do with life. And I think we've become too casual about what life is and what life isn't.  If every single life is precious, then we should not be having this discussion today. But I want you to think about that family leaving their home, a volunteer fireman who spent his whole life running to danger to save others, who took his wife and daughters to an event to see somebody who they really liked and they wanted to listen to. Four people in a car drive to the Butler Farm Showgrounds. That evening,  Helen and the two daughters go home. Corey's been killed. Helen has lost her husband. His daughters have lost their father. Forever etched in their memory is that moment, that single moment when those shots rang out.  So if you're asking yourself why these things happen, is it because maybe intentionally or unintentionally we stoke those fires? This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. This is an issue actually just about human being to human being. Do we respect life? Do we respect other people? And what is it that we're trying to accomplish? Isn't it amazing that we have to have a resolution in the Congress of the United States to condemn that type of action?  What happened to the Comptories is horrible. And when I was with Helen yesterday, for her, it's the same day over and over and over again. For Allison and Kaylee, it's the same thing for them over and over and over again. Look, the way we speak, the way we act, the way we insinuate things,  That'll continue. We can pass resolution after resolution. We can go to church on Sunday and abhor what's taking place and we leave that church and we go out and we practice what we just condemned in our churches. I would say that the illness has far deeper roots than we know. We're gonna pass this resolution. And we're gonna think that in some way, we were able to change the way people think and the way people act. I would just ask you all,  as you live your lives, think about it. Think about it. Some of these things are said casually. Some of these things are said to get a reaction. The members behind me, the people in our Congress, the people in our homes expect nothing less than for us to act respectful to each other and always honor life. So with that, I'm going to close. I don't know, uh,  He's not here. So we can take some questions. Okay. Uh, you know, Danny and I sat beside each other, by the way, there was another person who, and I think I told you about, uh, Mark Fogle's mother was with me and she just wanted to meet the president. And she, when she talked to the president, we were standing together and she said, Mr. President, please, please bring my son home. I miss my son. I'm staying alive so I can see him. The president told her, Ms. Fogle, I get elected. Your son will be home.  Mark Fogle is now home with his family. I would ask all of us to please let's honor life in every single way. So if there's a, if there's questions, please, and we're all open to listen to anything and you're all, if you all want to say anything, I want you to say stuff. I think they were all magnificent. What you said. It is about life. It is about life and much, much more strongly. This political talk has got to stop. Let's talk about the value of the pieces of legislation.  what, how we value it. If we don't like the legislation, you know, we can solve this with a vote, right? Is it their vote? Yes or a vote? No, it's not that complicated. I don't know why life has become so complicated. So please, anybody that wants to ask a question, please. Yes, ma'am."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1818.515, "text": " Yeah, I think probably all of the above, but I don't care how much funding we put into it."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1840.042, "text": "I don't care how much protection we have.  there's always going to be a danger.

So it isn't just something they heard about on...  TV or somebody talking, they were actually there for it. And so there's people that can't go back onto those grounds. There's people who have trouble sleeping. All these different things happen. So I don't know that there's enough money in the world to change some of the way people think. I wish it were that way.  we face something, we're going to have a resolution and we can pass resolution after resolution after resolution. I will let you be the judge of that when you talk among yourselves. How is your speech? Uh, and I think each American should ask that. And if you're truly thinking the way our country was formed and why it's why it was the way it is, uh, and then try to figure out what happened today. I have no idea why it's happened. Yes, sir. Yeah.  I usually don't comment on other members' remarks. I just know that right now, we're still doing work.  We're not the task force that was the task force, but we still were individuals who were still concerned about what happened on both sides of the aisle. I think it has to be careful when we start to say, what was this? They'd want to do this. They don't want to do that. We were told that there were certain things they couldn't talk about right now. Okay. Right now is a year ago.  So I would like to see other things come out. I'm, I gotta tell you, I have no idea what's going on with Mr. Ralph. I have no idea of how these other things happen. We haven't heard the federal agencies early on, uh, really had kind of locked us out of things. Local law enforcement and Butler was very forthcoming of what happened. Uh, so we're still waiting for some answers on some things that didn't happen. Um, but today is about the resolution. Uh, we could have another discussion about other things else that we think we, we fell far short of the questions we were asking.  Yes, sir. Okay. Are there any conversations at all about supplemental funding for extra or additional security in the districts given how many threats you all have talked about facing and even action and violence? I think there's always going to be conversations about that, but I know for myself and the rest of the members that are with it, I, uh, I don't know if there's enough money in the world  that can address the problems we have with morality today. So it's good to say, if we had just had a few more dollars that day, it wouldn't have happened. Really? Really? We keep talking about the problem as a lack of funding. My feeling is that we have a problem with a lack of respect for life, in general. And when people do these things, they're acting out on something that I, while I'm not in that business, I would say, there's something wrong with them.  But if we encourage it, and what we're talking about with this resolution has nothing to do with a lot of those things, but it does have to do with members of Congress coming together on a resolution condemning what's happening. So hopefully that will have an effect. And thank you all for being here. I think later on we can talk about other things because you have an interesting question. I think Ms. Lee would have answers too to what we didn't get that we thought we were going to get. So listen, thank you all for being here.

The president spoke from the Oval Office alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte during the NATO chief's visit to Washington.  Trump suggesting that he could impose 100% tariffs, but it was not clear right away what products would actually be targeted here. I do want to talk a little bit more about tariffs in general. So let's bring in Peter Navarro, the White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing. Thank you so much for taking the time to be here with us today.  Let's be really sure. All right. And first off, I do want to ask you about the situation here regarding President Trump's announcement, so to speak, earlier regarding what could happen if the war is not to end in 50 days. What impact could those tariffs actually have on Russia and their trading partners? But also, do we know what products would be included?"}, {"keywords": [], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 61.726, "text": " Well, let's talk about the impact broadly. In order for Russia to prosecute the war it's prosecuting at the intense level it is, it needs a tremendous amount of money. And right now it's getting a lot of that money from the sale of its oil and natural gas. And if you tariff that,  and you put on what's called secondary sanctions, which would penalize China, India, and other countries for buying Russian oil, that would have a tremendous impact on the Russian economy and on Russia's ability to wage war. So that's the underlying strategy here. And what we've seen in the past is that sanctions alone  are a very useful and important tool, and they are an effective tool. But when you combine the power of financial sanctions, which is to say to cut off, say, Russia's access to the financial system, if you combine that  with tariffs. It's a very potent weapon. The problem we've had with sanctions is that there's workarounds and runarounds that Russia has been able to do. So this is a complete package. The mission of President Trump, let's be clear, there are  millions of people that have died from this war. The loss of life in this war is unimaginable to the American mind. If you compare, for example, the roughly 60,000 soldiers we unfortunately lost in the Vietnam War, which was a multi-year war, it was many years, with  What's happened with Russia alone, it's at least a million soldiers and Ukraine probably another half million. I mean, it's just unbelievable bloodshed. It's just gotta stop. The president has tried to do everything so far he can to bring the parties to the table. This is the next step in his strategy. And he's giving Russia some time to think about  what to do and how to respond, not just putting the hammer down, but this is the way he negotiates. So as the boss likes to say, let's see what happens. But peace in Ukraine would be a tremendous boon, both to the world in terms of just the people dying, but also in terms of the economy and stability in the region."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 233.007, "text": " What about the European Union and, of course, Mexico?

I mean, Navarro's rule here is that every country cheats us in a different way, depending on how they're organized, their industrial policy. India, for example, is the Maharaja of tariffs, has the highest tariffs in the world, whereas Japan has very high non-tariff barriers to keep, for example, our automobiles out. If you look at Europe, Europe has  tariffs, for example, that are four times higher on our autos than theirs. As a result, our auto deficit with Europe is very, very significant. What's fair about that? But on top of that, they also have this thing called a value-added tax, and the way that's treated makes it effectively both an export subsidy  to their exports, but also an additional tariff. So the effective tariff, for example, on autos is 30% on American exports to Europe, whereas it's only 2.5% on German and French exports to us. So those are the kinds of things that's got to be settled in Europe, by the way. I mean, we've tried to play fair with Europe. We went to the World Trade Organization. We've won cases.  on things like pork and beef. And Europe just flat out refuses to abide by the results. So President Trump, we know that their deficit is, I think, the second highest behind China.  And it's stealing our jobs, it's stealing our factories, it's stealing our wealth and our assets. President Trump, if Europe doesn't settle with us in a good deal, then he is imposing unilaterally a good deal for them.  And what we have to be careful, and I would simply suggest to Europeans that the idea of retaliating against the United States when you're cheating the hell out of us, not a good idea. That's not fair. I think you guys over there in Europe have to go to the mountaintop, look at what you're doing to us, understand that it's not a level playing field, that we have a president who will not tolerate that.  and that we have to come to an accommodation which is fair to American workers and American business."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Tariffs"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 394.05, "text": "There's been a lot of criticism since President Trump did announce these tariffs.

We've collected almost 100 billion dollars so far in tariff revenues.  And what that allows us to do, for example, with the big beautiful bill, is to pay for that bill and pay for debt reduction. The Council of Economic Advisers, which is a quasi-independent body within the White House, just issued a study that showed that the tariffs that President Trump has put in has not led to any inflation  at all. And that's consistent with our experience from the first term. So you have to distinguish between what the panicans, as President Trump calls them in the media, want to say as attacks on Trump or attacks on his policies and what reality is and what we've learned about terrorists. OK, initially, the terrorists were put in place. Wall Street melted down. Well, guess what? Wall Street melted right back up when they realized the terrorists were good.  and we're bringing in investment. So forget about that problem there. As far as tariff uncertainty there's no uncertainty. President Trump is going to use tariffs to level the playing field raise revenues for the American people. And I think  The markets are realizing that and adjusting very well to that. So all is good in Trump land. All is good with the Trump trade deals. It's a long process.

My name is Josh Breslow and I've been here for the past several hours to bring you all of your top stories and live events from across the country and across the world. I do want to take you out to this live look over the White House here as we get to some breaking news. The U.S. Supreme Court clearing the way for President Trump's administration to resume dismantling the Department of Education, part of his bid to shrink the federal government's role in education  in favor of more control by the states now in the latest high court win for trump the justices lifted a federal judge's order that had reinstated nearly 1400 workers affected by mass layoffs at the department and blocked the administration from transferring key functions to other federal agencies  A legal challenge is continuing to play out as well there in the lower courts. The court's action came in a brief unsigned order, and its three liberal justices dissented. A group of 21 Democratic attorneys general, school districts, and unions behind a pair of legal challenges had warned in court papers that Trump's shutdown efforts threatened to impair the department's ability to perform its core duties.  Created by Congress in 1979, the Department of Education's main roles include administering college loans, tracking student achievement, and enforcing civil rights in schools. It also provides federal funding for needy districts and to help students with disabilities.  Federal law prohibits the department from controlling school operations, including curriculum, instruction, and staffing. Authority over these decisions belongs to state and local governments, which provide more than 85% of public school funding.  The department's Republican critics have portrayed the department as a symbol of bureaucratic waste, underlining the need for smaller federal government in favor of greater state power. In March, Trump sought to deliver on a campaign promise to conservatives by calling for the department's closure, quote,  We're going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs. Trump said that on March 20th before signing an executive order to close the department to the quote maximum extent allowed by law. President Trump said that certain quote core necessities would be preserved, including Pell grants to students from lower income families and federal funding for disadvantaged students and children with special needs.  though he did say those functions would be redistributed to other agencies and departments. President Trump in March directed that the department transfer its $1.6 trillion in student loan portfolio to the Small Business Administration and its special education services to the Department of Health and Human Services.  Again, all of this playing out right now as we have this post here from the Associated Press on social media saying breaking the Supreme Court is allowing President Trump to put his plan to dismantle the Education Department back on track.  and lay off nearly 1,400 employees.

They did not begin evacuating until around 2.30, according to this family member that we interviewed.

The alert did not include an evacuation order that  is not really put in place by the National Weather Service. They rely on community officials, including Kirk County, local jurisdiction there.

But I recognize if I was trapped somewhere and I couldn't use my own car to get to work, that is a hardship. So we're working as quickly as possible to get that bridge built, which is now built. My understanding of what the engineers were considering was a few options of bridges. They wanted one that was gonna be two lanes. And this is the design that they settled on that would be the quickest thing to build, would also accomplish the two lane access so that people could drive  a high clearance vehicle or a regular vehicle through it. I think that was a big, big thing for them. We are now looking at that bigger bridge that shifted slightly and looking at options there. My engineers today told me that there is some possibility that we could inspect it, see if that top part is in good shape. If so, lift it,  rotate it, fill in some damage that's under one side of that bridge, and then lower it. That would obviously be a quicker option than destroying the whole thing and rebuilding it.

I also got to say I'm so thankful for TDEM who has come in here with great resources from the state.

Now at 131, as the governor announced, 131 people are dead after the devastating floods in Central Texas. In Travis County, nine people are dead, three still missing. Burnett County, five people dead, one missing. In Williamson County, three people are dead and no one is missing.  rain is again in the forecast for 10 central texas slowing the emergency response to the initial flood and triggering new evacuation orders additional quick rainfall amounts to one to two inches are possible within heavy downpours with isolated amounts of three to five inches in that area and as we were talking to our fox  weather team on the ground yesterday. That new round of storms of precipitation will cause emergency crews relief efforts to recomb through some of the areas as the debris has moved down the river.

Donald Trump is doing a number of things. He's committing to supply weapons to Ukraine, but only by selling them to European nations first. He is giving Putin an ultimatum, agreeing to a deal within 50 days, and he's threatening 100% secondary tariffs on Russia if the Russian leader fails to comply.  The novel arrangement will see America selling billions of dollars' worth of advanced weapons, potentially to European countries, who will then supply them on to Ukraine, instead of America sending them directly to Ukraine, as it has so far in this war. Countries like Germany, Finland, the UK, Denmark would be among the NATO buyers supplying Ukraine. What weapons is not clear beyond Patriot missile air defence batteries?  Ukraine desperately needs better protection from Russian air attacks. They've ramped up massively recently, up by 50% in the last month alone. As these figures show here, almost 500 drones fired on the 9th of June, then peaking to more than 740 on one night last week. Compare that to a year ago when Ukraine was coping with 200 or 300 drones a night on average.  The number of drones and missiles launched by Russian forces in June this year was ten times the amount launched in June 2024, and it is exacting a punishing toll in terms of casualties. Last month saw the highest number of civilian casualties in any month since the war began from air attacks. More than 230 killed and more than 1,300 injured.

We had been tracking, I serve on the FDIC board, and we were tracking Silvergate Bank, and on that day they announced that they were not going to need to be put into receivership, they would be self-liquidating.  And simultaneously, on that same day, we had an announcement by Silicon Valley Bank, which was a little bit of a goofy press release they issued, saying they're experiencing some real losses on their securities portfolio and they're going to be looking for capital.  it raised a lot of red flags and suspicions about whether they were viable. And this is something that is just so fundamental about banking and deposit taking is that it really is based on a belief that your money is gonna be there. And the truth is, is with federal deposit insurance and federal reserve discount window lending,  It always is, except when you have a bank that is over 90% uninsured deposits. This is something that is really unusual and some would argue is not even really a bank when you are that dependent on very, very large depositors that you grew so quickly.

A bunch of them apparently just put their money in a bank.  which is kind of weird to me, a non-insured. And then we had the stock market plunge in 2022, funding dried up. There was no, very little new VC fundraising. So new dry powder to be put into the bank, startups drawing down their own deposits just to make payroll or whatever else.

But I think, and I agree with every small and mid-sized business out there, if I am launching a startup, whether it is an AI company or a dry cleaner,  It doesn't rank in the top 20 reasons of my business failing that my bank is gonna fail. And so what you start hearing is that these businesses, which are highly networked, as well as much faster communication, you get the advice from your funders and others that you need to run.

And of course, those insured depositors, the insured depositors really through the entire crisis did not really run. It was those uninsured. It started at Silicon Valley Bank.  After that Wednesday release, by Friday morning, they were dead. We had actually voted the night before, or maybe at the pre-dawn hours, to accept it into receivership, and I believe by the time it was closed, it had roughly $100 billion queued up of outbound wires.

It was a regional bank crisis, as in specifically the region of California. Because then there were other banks that got into a lot of trouble. And the all thing they had in common  was that they were all sort of in some way connected to California. I think I remember like people were going out and looking for any bank that had California in the title in some way and betting against them.

Of course, the second bank that we closed that Sunday was Signature Bank, which operated a crypto network, but also had a very real business. It is a New York City bank that was deeply involved in New York City multifamily real estate.  You, at the same time, Joe, had people worried about commercial real estate.

Here's how it works. The federal law basically directs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC, to resolve a failed bank at the least cost  to the deposit insurance fund. That's the fund that everyone pays into with their bank deposits and it builds up a fund to pay for certain bank failures and make sure deposits are made whole. And here's what was interesting about Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and then later First Republic, it was a super majority of uninsured deposits. That means a bank failure is not that expensive  to resolve. The cost to the deposit insurance fund for a bank that is 90% plus uninsured is going to be pretty low. And if the law says resolve it at the least cost, in many ways the best case is sometimes to liquidate it.  make as many people whole as possible and top them up with the deposit insurance fund. But there is a proviso in the law which says that if a failure is likely to lead to systemic effects or to threaten the viability of the US financial system, there's a process  of key turning that a series of regulators must go through to recommend to the treasury secretary who must consult with the president to authorize the FDIC to take a different path. So over the weekend, the Sunday after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Sunday morning, roughly, Signature Bank was taken into receivership, First Republic was  a zombie and basically dead already. There was a decision where the FDIC board, we voted to turn that key and the Federal Reserve Board had voted to turn that key. And ultimately the Treasury Secretary discussed it with the president and activated that authority. The authority essentially led to the backstopping of all uninsured deposits.  That meant that everyone would be made whole in the case of the failure, and it was a tough decision. I think there was a question.  I was arguing and questioning, should we be maybe raising the limit dramatically, perhaps to 25 or $50 million? What we were seeing in the system was active movement of uninsured deposits everywhere. And ultimately, the decision to invoke that exception really did calm the system for the most part, with the big exception of First Republic Bank."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 29, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1212.77, "text": " So the other thing that happened other than the expanded deposit insurance was the creation of a new Fed lending facility, another acronym, the BTFP.

There was lots of issues we dealt with when it comes to fraud and identity theft. There were certainly issues when it comes to the shift of where money was being stored. Many people believed that the app they were using to send money had money in a bank account somewhere, but in fact, maybe it was in an uninsured account.  So I think that we should be looking at payments in terms of what is the ambitions of those companies and why do they want it. We worked hard  with global central banks and regulators to inject more competition. Apple, for example, had a real chokehold over iOS devices, only allowing Apple Pay to be used.

I really worry that if we keep having enormous flows from banks to these money funds, we are essentially going to create problems with how we transmit and intermediate credit to the real economy.  I would argue that a stable coin, if it was a tokenized bank deposit versus a tokenized money market fund, has a lot of different effects long term. Most of us know that banks are still the key to lend to small businesses, to lend to farms, and to lend to the real economy. If you are essentially putting a thumb on the scale,  toward money market funds or tokenized money market funds, the beneficiaries are very large firms, sovereigns, and others who can access those money markets.

I would argue that one of the best ways  to pursue some tokenized payment systems that could potentially disintermediate the incumbent payment networks would be to use tokenized bank deposits. And just like we could have paper cash, each issued by a different regional federal reserve bank, our digital wallets could host tokenized bank deposits that are sitting in banks across the country.  and being intermediated into credit to the real economy.

I guess my question is like presumably you want a diverse network of lenders out there because you want to avoid the too big to fail problem and you want people to have access to credit to your point earlier.

But I think one of the real big reasons is that there is a perception that the very largest banks, as you mentioned, will be protected. When Silicon Valley Bank was failing, where was all the money flowing to?  they were taking their money out of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and others, it went to the very big guys because every investor believes that these banks are essentially always going to be protected. They are able to raise money with that implicit guarantee and that means they are able to outcompete on so many dimensions  unfairly, I think, their smaller counterparts.

At the same time that we're responding to Kerrville, there have been an abundance of storms and large swaths of the state of Texas that have impacted lives and taken lives and destroyed homes, facilities, buildings, and roads across large regions in central Texas.  As a reminder, I have declared 21 counties in my Governor Disaster Declaration.

They include areas surrounding the communities of Uvalde, Del Rio, and Konkan. The state is already deploying resources in those regions to help them get prepared. We'll be working with local officials in those regions just as we have in these other regions.  and in those regions as well as in Travis and Williamson County as well as in Kerr County. Job number one is always saving lives, protecting lives and finding those who have lost their lives and that is a 24-7 operation that we are unrelenting in continuing to pursue. That includes especially if you look at  The areas in either in Williamson or Travis County or counties nearby, if you saw the rushing waters over the past 24 hours, you know that there were an extraordinary number of people who had to be rescued. Dozens of people were rescued because of our extraordinary first responder teams. And I want to thank the Gab Mortons who have really stepped up and done a great job, National Guard, Texas Department of Public Safety, local firefighters and local first responders, as well as Texas Task Force One and Texas Task Force Two.  and others who are truly saving lives. Many Texans' lives have been endangered. Most of those lives have been rescued by our first responders here in the state of Texas.  The latest numbers of what we see both in the state, and I'll talk about the local counties where we are, as it concerns Texans who were lost, as well as those who are missing. Statewide, there's a total of 131 fatalities to be reported. Breaking that down in current and nearby counties. In Travis County, nine people have lost their lives, there were three missing.  And Burnett County, four who lost their lives, and there's one missing. In Williamson County, there were three who lost their lives, and no one is missing at this time.  The stories about those who've been swept away is gut-wrenching and heartbreaking. And the kind of thing that spurs us to do even more to make sure that we're going to be searching and finding everybody that we can, as well as spurring the response that both the state and local governments, as well as the federal government, will have to make sure that we fully address the challenges that Texans have faced over the past week or so.  In addition to the lives of our fellow Texans, there are homes that have been destroyed, people who don't have a place to stay. The state is working with local officials to address those needs. There's also infrastructure around those people that make living where they are or accessing their home either difficult or impossible. I visited one today. I visited the Big Sandy Creek Bridge.  and was astonished at what I saw. If you haven't seen it, it's a two-lane road and has two yellow lines in the middle of it to divide one roadway from the other from going in opposite directions. And the center part of the bridge was literally moved about half a foot in one direction, which shows the power of the water that was pushing through there.  Let me just add this. All of America has their eyes on what's going on in Texas. And Americans are praying, caring for, and helping our state so much. It's just unbelievable.  But quite literally, half of the states of the United States are providing resources to help Texans either deal with those who are missing, help rebuild, whatever the need is. And I want to root out the states, the 25 states, that are assisting Texas right now.  Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. You can see one thing that's quite obvious. And that is, it doesn't matter if they're a red state or a blue state.  They are fellow Americans. And when times get tough, Americans come together. That is even more true as it concerns Texans. This has been an extraordinarily challenging time, if not the most extraordinarily challenging time that Texans have faced. And in typical Texas fashion, Texans have united, come together. And as I was visiting the Big Sandy Creek Bridge area, there was a young man who lived in what had been a marooned area.  And he said, you know, at times like this, we are community. And everybody comes together and supports each other. And that's exactly what I see across the entire state. I'm proud of our fellow Texans, proud of our fellow Americans, for the way they've all leaned into this to ensure that we as a state, we as a people, are going to be able to respond to this and deal with this as rapidly as possible. Now I'm going to turn things over to Director Williams with the Texas Department of Transportation."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 550.595, "text": " Thank you, Governor. As you mentioned, our efforts here in the Central Texas area now are primarily focused on the rebuilding of the bridge at Cow Creek at RM 1431. Throughout this event, for the past couple of, for the past few weeks, we've been supporting the efforts to repair and replace roads that have been damaged in Williamson and Travis County, Burnett Counties.  The one remaining section that we're focused on is the bridge at Cow Creek. On the Monday after the bridge washed out, the bridge washed out on a Saturday morning, we had contractors in place with heavy equipment that were beginning the work of removing the debris from that bridge that was completely destroyed.  And so that process is continuing as we speak. In addition, our bridge teams with the Austin District of the Texas Department of Transportation have been working literally 24-7 to design a new bridge to replace that bridge that was washed out. We've also been working with members of the Federal Highway Administration that were on site with us this past Monday as well to review that damage.  We've released those bids to contractors now that we have a complete design in hand. We expect to have bids back from those contractors on Wednesday of this week. And then after we award that contract, we will begin the process of transitioning from the debris removal contract that is still out there with a lot of heavy equipment today  to the construction work on the new bridge. We're targeting a 60-day construction period for that bridge with some significant incentives to work to reduce the time frame for the replacement of that bridge by at least 20 days if we can. And so we know that that's a very significantly  important bridge. It's an important travel corridor between Marble Falls, Lago Vista, and Cedar Park. A lot of people commute back and forth. The school year will be coming up soon. We have some students that attend Marble Falls ISD that live on the east side of that bridge, and so we need to be able to have plans in place to accommodate them. We're working with the school district on that as well. Overall, though, we've made some significant progress statewide. We're continuing, Governor, as you know, to work  in the Kerrville Hunt area on State Highway 39 and Ranch Road 1340 to repair and replace the bridges and the roads that were damaged there. We did, as you also spoke about, experience some flooding and some additional damage just in the past couple of days.  And we had road impacts. We had 49 roads that were impacted over the past 24 hours. 37 of those were closed due to high water, and some of those were damaged. But we're going to be able to get those turned around and replaced and repaired relatively quickly. And hopefully, the water will go down, and we'll get a break from the rain.

Before I get into a search and recovery efforts and Texas Game Wardens' response to this historic tragedy of a series of events in central Texas and in Carr County, I'd like to just remind everybody that all of these efforts and all through this tragedy, Texas comes together under Governor Abbott's strong leadership  of the Texas Department of Emergency Management, Department of Public Safety, all of our local first responders, all of our local EMS, all of our local volunteers, and everybody who is in Texas who comes together in such a tragic time and unites to help the people of Texas. Texas Game Wardens, as of July 3rd, through the State Operations Center, were set up and poised in anticipation of a flooding event.  Through the calls coming in late and early of July 4th, Texas game wardens were deployed to Kerr County. Since then, around 300 game wardens have deployed in the Kerr County and surrounding areas. In anticipation of other flooding occurring in Central Texas, we were able to strategically stage, through the Texas Division of Emergency Management, several swift water assets in Central Texas out of the Kerr County area, just in case this flooding grew a little more widespread.  Unfortunately, it did grow a little more widespread and we started conducting rescue operations not only through our swift water technicians, but our aviation, multiple canine searches and through our drone team.  Through those, we were able to successfully rescue several individuals and multiple evacuations. We currently have, through Texas Task Force 1, wardens embedded in multiple search groups, searching Cal and Sandy Creek, looking for the remaining victims of this terrible tragedy. We've also got our canine detection teams in  in deployment with the search and rescue teams and our aviation still embedded in these.

And listen, I want to thank you all in the press for helping us get this message out. Life safety remains our number one priority. As such, as we've talked about additional rains coming into the state, we have pre-positioned swift water rescue assets, as the governor mentioned, around Uvalde, around El Rio, and around Concan. Help us get that message down to those folks to turn around, don't drown, don't drive through a low water crossing if you can't see the road in front of you.  And if you were in a low-lying area, please plan on moving to higher ground once the rain starts to come. Another thing I need you to remember is it does not have to be raining where you are in order for you to be impacted by flooding. Second, the governor mentioned the 21 counties in his declaration. We have six counties right now that are in the federal declaration for individual assistance. Those counties are Burnet,  Kerr, San Saba, Tom Green, Travis, and Williamson for individual assistance. We have a disaster recovery center open in Kerr County right now, and you will be hearing from your local partners here, many of those standing behind us, about the disaster recovery centers that will be opening in Travis and Williamson counties very soon.  On the public assistance side, this is the money that goes to the local governments to help with emergency response cost and debris and repairing. You have 10 counties that are under the President's disaster declaration. Those are Burnett, Kendall, Kerr, Kimball, Lano, Mason, McCullough, Menard, San Saba, and Tom Green. Both Travis and Williamson counties are, it appears to us they have met their threshold. We're working with them to get the documentation to FEMA. We expect those to be turned on very soon.  I want to let you know we have over 2300 state employees working under the governor's direction to support our local government partners. But a number that continues to blow me away is the over 13,000 volunteers just coming out to help anywhere they can. We're grateful for the volunteers, but I need help getting the message to the volunteers also.  In each of these communities, we will be establishing volunteer reception centers. The idea is for your volunteers to go to those sites so that we can match up your capabilities and skills with the needs of the community. We also want to be able to communicate with you. Up in Kerr County, on the Guadalupe River, we've had a tactical pause for a day and a half now  because of the rain in the waters that are coming down that river. We cannot afford to have people in the water and right next to the water that are not Swift Water Rescue trained and capable of at least saving themselves from being near that water because of the amount of rainfall that we're getting. Please help us communicate with the volunteers.  think a volunteer that's out there if you see them helping do everything you can to make sure they understand the message and we will continue to work together to support our partners.

First, I will tell you this, because I did not share this with you earlier. I didn't mention those who were missing in the greater Kerrville area, which is 97 reported as of now. Let me first tell you an issue about those who are missing, then I'm going to answer your question.  So everybody who is at a camp, everybody who is at a hotel and places like that, they've been identified. Those who are missing on this list, most of them, were more difficult to identify because there was no record of them logging in anywhere. And it was through information provided by a friend, a family member, co-worker, whatever the case may be, that they haven't been found. Even though we are reporting 97 people missing,  There's no certainty that all 97 of those people were swept away by the storm. That point aside, to more specifically answer your question, and that is, the goal obviously is to continue to find those who are alive.  For those who have passed away, it's so important to closure for their families that we find them and identify them. Sometimes it does require using DNA testing to identify who they are and identify who their family is to make sure that we connect appropriately, correctly, the family member with the person who lost their lives.

Two parts to it. One is the governor's declaration. There was no delay in getting these counties on the governor's declaration once we knew that they were in the target area. That's part one.  Part two is the individual assistance for both of these counties, which is the money that goes and is made available to homeowners and renters, is already turned on in these counties as well. What we're working through right now is the public assistance, and that is a mathematical equation, as the governor said, based on the population of a county and the amount of damage that FEMA can certify in that county. The less populated counties have a much smaller threshold, $500,000, $600,000 versus millions of dollars for these two populated counties.  I am confident both counties have met their threshold, and I would bet by today or tomorrow we get answers back on these counties. I also want to say that does not delay any of the work that's going on. Waiting for those federal declarations to come in does not slow down rescue, does not slow down search, does not slow down additional law enforcement or additional fire protection or emergency medical services, nor has it been slowing down the debris removal, getting roads and driveways opened up.

So again, Wisconsin is slightly different than most states who are completely abusing the process. And again, I think what's unfortunate is we just may see Wisconsin really engage in the same type of behavior that other states are, which is just  not feasible. So I've got a pretty good video up on my ex-post where we're talking about Republican leaders say we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. Again, $4.4 to $7 trillion, I hope most people recognize, that's completely unjustified. It's not like we're spending too little. We're spending way too much, and we're wasting too much money. I realize the media, I realize Democrat lies. We're talking about all these cuts. All we're doing is reducing the growth in spending, which is completely unsustainable.  So I know you're probably concerned and afraid because all that scare mongering, but we're not cutting spending on these programs. We're just trying to fix the problem of Medicaid, of Obamacare's addition to Medicaid, which puts all that at risk. As Elon Musk says in that video, if we don't fix this, there won't be money for any of these things. And one of the reasons people got pretty snarly during the 2024 election is because the 40-year high inflation caused by  massive, out-of-control deficit spending that we can't afford. And he devalued the dollar. I laid out those different pre-pandemic levels of spending from 98, 2014, 2019. I also took a look at, what is your dollar worth? Your 1998 dollar is now worth $0.51. A dollar you held in 2014 is worth $0.74. A dollar you held as recently as 2019 is worth $0.80. That is wiping out people's savings.  making all these goods and services, you know, unaffordable. And again, that's all because of massive government deficit spending.

We partnered closely with Senate Democrats under the leadership of Chuck Schumer to strongly and uniformly oppose Donald Trump's one big ugly bill. And I'm confident that Senate Republicans will continue  to rubber stamp Donald Trump's extreme judicial choices, and Senate Democrats will continue to aggressively push back on behalf of the American people. This whole situation that America has found itself in over the last six-plus months has been one big corrupt, chaotic, and cruel project  that has been unleashed on the American people and it continues. I mean this Texas thing shouldn't surprise anyone because despite the claims by house Republican leaders that the American people have fallen in love with these extremists in the house of representatives and so they're acting upon a mandate. Give me a break. The only reason  The only reason that house Republicans even have a majority right now is because they stole three seats from the people of North Carolina. North Carolina is a 50 50 state. Donald Trump narrowly won the state in 2024. It's a democratic governor, a democratic lieutenant governor, a democratic attorney general, democratic elected officials across the state.  of North Carolina who won on the same day. North Carolina is a 50-50 state. The North Carolina Congressional Delegation, which previously had fair congressional lines, produced a 50-50 congressional delegation. Seven Democrats, seven Republicans, as recently as January 2nd of this year. That was the makeup of the North Carolina Congressional Delegation. What happened?  Republicans engaged in mid-decade redistricting in a 50-50 state that had fair maps and produced an evenly divided delegation, and took it from 7-7, stole three seats that were in Democratic hands from the people of North Carolina as a result of illegitimate mid-decade congressional gerrymandering, and turned that delegation into 10 Republicans and four Democrats.  There's a three seat difference in the House of Representatives right now when Republicans are at full strength and Democrats are at full strength. 220 Republicans to 215 Democrats. That entire difference, the majority that Republicans have can be explained solely by the fact that they cheated in North Carolina. These people have zero credibility.  in terms of the issues that they're allegedly championing on behalf of the American people. If you believed in your ideas and the power of your issues, then why are you trying to cheat now in Texas, just like you did in North Carolina? The problem that Republicans confront is that the Texas congressional map is already gerrymandered.  And so this gerrymander may actually turn into a dummy-mander because they are going to create a situation where four, five, six, seven, eight Republicans who are currently in safe districts are going to be on the front line of our efforts to flip seats, particularly in a midterm election where Donald Trump is deeply unpopular and his signature one big ugly bill.  is deeply unpopular. Imagine a group of people, this is how corrupt they are, who in the middle of a search and rescue operation that is taking place in Texas right now, dozens of children drowned to death. Some of that has to do with incompetence in the Texas state government and incompetence in the Trump administration.  And instead of actually trying to be there for the people of Texas and the hill country, children at summer camp, who's lost their lives, they call a special session. And the main reason for that special session is to try to steal the midterm elections by rigging the Texas congressional map. These people are complete and total embarrassment.  The American people are not going to stand for it. And things aren't going to get better for them. Politically, they're only going to get worse.

The so-called rescissions package continues the destructive Republican pattern. Cut now, ask questions later. The same thing that's happening with FEMA and the National Weather Service is happening right here.  Again, use that chainsaw. Cut, cut, cut. Don't look at what you're cutting, what its effect will be, whether it's waste or whether it's sinew and bone. And then later say, oh, maybe we shouldn't have done that. And you know what, Mr. President? Our Republican senators, most of them know this is wrong, but they're so afraid of Donald Trump  Yesterday, he threatened any of them who voted against the full rescissions package that we have before us would face his wrath. What is going on here? Does anyone stand up to these horrible, horrible cuts that hurt the American people? Republicans in real time are cutting health care. They're cutting education. They're cutting aid for our veterans. Veterans are not getting, they asked them,  The veterans know they're not getting the health care they used to. And making things even worse, Donald Trump's tariffs are coming in at the worst possible time. And in a few short months, they're going to raise the cost of groceries. They're going to hurt small businesses and do untold damage to our economy. And now this package suffocates public broadcast. Well, did they even know when they said they wanted to cut it? You know, Donald Trump doesn't seem to like it.  How much it helps our rural communities? It's the only place they can rely on for local news, for weather reports? That farmers across rural America depend on public broadcast to get weather reports? Because there's no other way? Do they know that it guts international aid that ensures America's national security?  Did they even think of the consequences? Just because Donald Trump says he wants it cut, and everyone knows he doesn't know the details of any of this stuff. The rescissions package is certainly troubling, but the pattern behind it is even worse. It sets the stage for even more party-line devastating cuts in the future, to health care, to education, anything Republicans decide they don't like, all on a party-line vote, all because of obeisance and fear of Donald Trump.  not a conviction that he's doing the right thing. This is a dark omen moving forward. Our Republican friends say they fight for the middle class. They say they fight for working people. Then they turn around and take investments away from the middle class in rural America. I urge them, urge them, not to proceed with this bill as written. Now on health care costs. Republicans' big ugly betrayal will devastate American health care this year.  Not many years down the line. Not a few years down the line. It's going to hurt now. There's a growing idea among Republican members of Congress and then the lobbyists who talk to the press all the time that hospitals don't need to worry about the big ugly bill because there's time to stave off or change the horrible Medicaid cuts Republicans passed and are now running away from. That's garbage.  Donald Trump and Republican leaders forced their members to walk the plank and cut Medicaid to the bone. So now they're in damage control mode. They know how bad it is. They want to make their big, ugly bill seem less destructive and seem more palpable, when in reality, it's quite literally a death sentence for rural hospitals and vulnerable Americans. And that death sentence for so many of them is not two years away. It's now. Here are the facts.  that show Republicans' big, ugly betrayal is having an impact right now, not later. At least 300 rural hospitals are at immediate risk of closing because of this bill. Already, already, not two years from now, now, this week, two weeks after the bill passed, hospitals in Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Maine have announced their closing or are in serious danger of closing, not in 2027,  Not in 2028. Now. Now. Governors in at least eight states, eight states, have called special sessions this summer. Not in 2028. Not in 2027. They've called special sessions this summer. Or are pushing stopgap subsidies to shield doctors and hospitals from the immediate harm. States don't see the big ugly bill as a problem for years from now. To them, to the workers,  And most of all, to the people who get health care in a lot of these rural hospitals, it's a problem right now. And this fall, more problems. Not in 2028, folks. This fall, people will get notices that their insurance premiums for the Affordable Care Act will go up 75 percent on average because Republicans chose not to extend tax credits for the ACA.  This will also impact people on private insurance. If you don't have ACA, Medicaid, Medicare, you're still going to get increases in your insurance. Everyone is affected by these cuts. Just about everyone. Unless you're one of those billionaires who self-insures. You don't have to have insurance because you've got all the money in the world to pay any medical bill. That's not true of the vast majority of Americans. And what they're doing is just the start. Republicans have made it clear they want even deeper cuts to Medicaid.  Many in the House Freedom Caucus, those right-wingers, have said they weren't satisfied with their big, ugly bill. So, who is to say that Donald Trump and Russell Vogt won't use rescissions or another reconciliation bill to cut for health care even deeper? And what are our Republican colleagues going to do when the handful of right-wing Freedom Caucus people in this body and the other body  Say they demand cuts or they won't vote for any bill? Are they going to cave once again? Say, OK. Let me say it again. All this talk from Republicans that many of their own cuts won't materialize is utter nonsense. Hospitals are closing now. States are reacting now. Insurance companies are adjusting now.

On July the 13th, 2024, an assassin nearly killed President Trump. The gunman injured him and two rally participants and killed Corey Comitera. We keep him, his family in our prayers as well as everyone affected that day.  Today, one year and one day later, I come to the floor to provide an update on my ongoing oversight of that attempted assassination. The day of the shooting, I launched an investigation focused on gathering and releasing information to the public. I didn't want the public to be kept in the dark.  Public transparency stops conspiracy theories. 60 years after JFK's assassination, we still have questions being asked. Unfortunately, there are still aspects to that shooting where the government hasn't been transparent. The Biden administration stonewalled my oversight requests.  I strongly urge the new administration to let all the facts breathe, unlike the last administration. The day of the shooting, my oversight unit quickly got to work. They talked to patriotic whistleblowers. They informed dozens of witnesses and interviewed them, including local law enforcement officials.  rally goers, and local businesses. I have staff obtained and reviewed weeks worth of security footage, text messages, pictures, law enforcement briefing materials, after action reports, and still other records. They also obtained police body camera  camera footage that provided the first video of what happened in the aftermath of that shooting. I made it all public. At the time, my investigative work unveiled the most detailed picture of the Trump assassination attempt. As part of my oversight, I asked the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General  to review the matter. I also requested the Government Accountability Office to do the same as I asked the Inspector General to do. The American people wanted answers. They wanted accountability in the aftermath of this tragedy. I have worked hard to do just that. And I know there's more work to be done.  This past weekend, the Government Accountability Office produced me its report on the July 13 assassination attempt. The Government Accountability Office report starts by stating, quote, the U.S. Secret Service failed to implement security measures  that could have prevented the assassination attempt on then former President Donald J. Trump during a July 13th, 2024 campaign rally,\" end quote. According to the report, prior to the July 13th rally,  Secret Service received information from the intelligence community about a threat against President Trump's life. Yet, this threat information wasn't shared with Secret Service personnel or local law enforcement officials, all responsible for securing that event.  Clearly, had all federal, state, and local law enforcement officials known of this threat, it would have changed how they secured the AGR building where the sniper opened fire from. As I previously made public, Secret Service and its local partners had cell phone issues on July 13th. The Government Accountability Office report  found that Secret Service didn't have a policy to assess cellular service at the site, even though communication is key during any major event like this. This resulted in the Secret Service not receiving real-time threat information and updates during the search for the gunman. Every delayed second  in finding the gunman meant that he was one step closer to carrying out his evil objective. I previously made public documents showing that the Secret Service had issues with counter drone system at the rally. The General Government Accountability Office confirmed my previous oversight.  GAO found that the Secret Service's counter drone operator lacked the training, the knowledge, and support to fix and operate the counter drone system. According to the Government Accountability Office report, these problems occurred because the Secret Service didn't follow its own requirements that personnel  must complete training before operating a counter drone system. The GEO report says the Secret Service said using a counter drone is like turning on a flashlight. Yet the counter drone did not work and the Secret Service could not fix it. Had a counter drone been operating as planned,  It could have identified the shooter's drone and even the shooter. The Government Accountability Office's report also found that Secret Service planned to use farm equipment to address a line-of-sight issue when securing the AGR building. Before the rally,  A campaign staffer asked Secret Service to modify the plan, which the advance team did as the staffer requested. But they didn't notify senior officials overseeing the rally of these changes. If they had, the senior officials might have overruled them. While the report says the Secret Service has made changes direct  correct some of these problems, they still have more work to do. The Secret Service operates in a zero-fail mission, and they don't have room for any error. Every failure exposed by the Government Accountability Office report must be turned into positive changes in the Secret Service.  I want my colleagues to know that I'll be riding herd on them until I'm satisfied the job is done. I want to close out by thanking the law enforcement officers serving on the front lines, including the Secret Service, Capitol Police, their law enforcement partners, and of course their families, all working hard and sacrificing to keep the public and the government safe. I am grateful  to you all and do not in the future then take the days that seem uneventful for granted.

I ask that we dispense with the quorum call. Without objection. Thank you. Madam President, this is such a significant day. In just a few minutes, this chamber will vote to confirm Ms. Whitney Hermendorfer to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. She is the very first judicial nomination of President Trump's second term.  And there is a good reason that the president selected Ms. Hermann-Dorfer for the circuit court. There is no one more qualified  to take on this important role as an appellate judge for our great nation. Now, a little bit about her background. She is a Tennessee native. She attended Nashville's Harpeth Hall School, and she was an outstanding athlete and an outstanding  student at the Harpeth Hall School, which as an educational institution has a really long history of producing and graduating remarkable women. And Ms. Hermann-Dorfer is one of those. She graduated magna cum laude from Princeton, and she was first in her law school class at GWU.  And it will not surprise my colleagues to learn that Ms. Hermendorfer's career has been a stellar career. After graduating from law school, she was an associate at Williams & Conley, where her practice focused on appellate litigation and regulatory and administrative law.  She also clerked for four federal judges, including three Supreme Court justices, Justice Alito, Justice Barrett, and then Judge Kavanaugh when he was on the D.C. Circuit. Since 2003, she has served as director of the Strategic Litigation Unit in the office of Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Schermette.  In that role, she has not only been an aggressive attorney, she has led a team of talented attorneys  in the AG's office, fighting to protect the constitutional rights of Tennesseans. There is no doubt that she will serve our nation admirably on the Sixth Circuit. She will be a tireless advocate for our Constitution. She will show respect for the rule of law.  She will show respect for the Constitution as it is written. She will not be a judge who will try to rewrite it. She is eminently qualified to serve, and I urge all my colleagues to vote to confirm her nomination. I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum. The clerk will call the roll.

It's a honor, great honor, to have a friend of mine who's become very friendly over the last number of years. We knew each other before, but Mark is the head of NATO, Mark Rutte, Secretary General of NATO. Highly respected by everybody that knows him, but in particular the European countries. They have great reliance on him.  And he's done a fantastic job. And we had a tremendous meeting. I guess it's about a month now, a month ago. And I think Mark will tell you that it was really, perhaps, more important the date of November 5th. That was the election day. Maybe that was the most important, because we've made tremendous progress together. And one of the reasons that you're here today is to hear that we are very unhappy \u2014 I am \u2014 with Russia.  But we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with them. And we're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. Tariffs at about 100 percent. You call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine.  And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it. And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there. So based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. It's very simple. And they'll be at 100 percent. And that's the way it is. It can be more simple. It's just the way it is. I hope we don't have to do it.  But regardless, we are going to be. We make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's missiles. You saw that recently in Iran, the way those planes flew in, they had every single 14 bombs at every target. Then you had the helicopter shoot a total of 30 bombs, 30 missiles, and they hit every single mark. Is that right? Every single piece, every single target.  And it was, I guess, on a scale of 0 to 10, they say it was about a 15. That's how successful it was. That's how lethal it was, a word they like to use nowadays. But it was an amazing, well-organized attack.  that people in this country want to do for 24 years. You know, when we had the pilots in last week, they were saying, Sir, we've been practicing this for 24 years, meaning people, not them, but other people that are a little older now, but they too. And you were the one that let us do it. But we've been practicing it three to four times a year for 22, 24 years.  Because they always knew they had to stop Iran from doing what they were doing, which is trying to come up with a nuclear weapon, a nuclear bomb. And we did it very successfully. And we make the best equipment, the best missiles, the best of everything.  But the European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too.  We're in for a lot of money and we just, we don't want to do anymore and we can't. But we make the best and we're going to be sending the best to NATO and in some cases to maybe, at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany where they're going to send early on missiles.  And they'll be replaced, and NATO is going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here. He's a great ambassador, and Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So in a nutshell, we're going to make top of the line weapons and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something and it'll be mostly in the form of a replacement.  And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy for having had the career that he's had. He had an amazing career before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months. And if you could say a few words. Absolutely."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 314.587, "text": "No, no, Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision, and the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you don't want Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent.  but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production. So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have Kingdom and Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more.  So what we'll do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need, so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning, as Pete Hicks said, at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them. So I really want to thank you for that, and at least the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here. So really, thank you. This is important. Thank you. SECRETARY KERRY."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 441.349, "text": "You did a great job. That's a really great job.  We've been very successful in settling wars. You have India-Pakistan. You have Rwanda and the Congo. That was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled. And they did. And they were both great, great leaders. And they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years.  And at least 7 million people killed and killed with a lot of pretty rough weapons like machetes, heads chopped off, going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near, so frightening. And we got that one solved.  Serbia, Kosovo, Bethesda. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I use. I use trade for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars. That was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here.  The strip, the Gaza Strip, I call it the Gaza Strip, one of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace. It brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Whitkoff is here, and I think we could have something fairly soon to  talk about. And we solved another one, one that we just seem to have Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with an extra neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which  closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we're working on that one. It's a problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that. You've been hearing about that one. And that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam.  But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income and life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia.  I'm not happy, and I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started. If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye.  But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they're going to have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. I was outside looking in. And I said, you know, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said.  And it started and it's a real mess. We're losing. I guess they're losing five or six thousand people. There's actually now more. I used to I was saying five thousand. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up. It's a horrible war and it should be stopped. And so if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing. Secondary tariffs and they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do. But I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk. And then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people. It's got to stop. That's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States going to NATO, et cetera.  And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance.  They still would have had no chance if the equipment, they had the best equipment, because we do make the best planes and missiles. And we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. We have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about the Golden Dome. It's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage because somebody has to use that equipment.  And they fought with tremendous courage and they continue to fight with tremendous courage, but they don't have, they're losing on equipment and Russia's really taken a very positive, very, very  strong, I mean, what they've done in the last couple of weeks."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 750.259, "text": "Without military reasons, that's what they are doing. 700 drones a day, missiles, bombing cities.

And you were there. Most of you, many of you were there. The level of esprit de corps spirit that they have is amazing. They really think it's a very, very important  thing to do, or they wouldn't be doing it. Look, they're agreeing to just, you know, they're paying for everything. We're not paying anymore. We were, we have an ocean separating us. I said, we have a problem. We make the best stuff, but we can't keep doing this. And Biden should have done this years ago. He should have done it from the beginning, but he didn't. He didn't know he was there.  This guy, what a horrible job they did to this country. And I just hope between the border and this and so many other inflation, what a horrible administration, the worst administration in history, in my opinion. That's not my opinion. I think it's everybody's opinion. But this is something that  shouldn't have happened, and we're going to see if we can end it. I do want to make one statement. Again, I said it before. This is not Trump's war. We're here to try and get it finished and settled and whatever, because nobody wins with this. This is a loser from every standpoint. This was Biden, and this was other people.  And it's a very sad situation. This gentleman is doing a great job. I think he's going to get it.

They're sick people.  I guarantee he knew nothing about what he was signing. I guarantee it. So they're going to figure it out, and we'll see what happens. But to me, the Otoe Pen, you know, you elected president, you know what the Otoe Pen is supposed to do? Sign thousands of letters from young people that write. I get we get thousands of letters a week, Susie, right? Thousands. I mean, tens of thousands. Sometimes I look at a room. There's a room where we have many, many people working, responding.  sending letters back. That's what an auto pen is supposed to be. To write to a young seven year old boy that writes to the president and he wants to be president someday and he loves America. That's what the auto pen is supposed to be. It's not supposed to be for signing major legislation and all the things. No, the auto pen. And I doubt he knew. I doubt I doubt they even spoke to him about it. I think they had if it's called a freewheeling auto pen.  Like, Biden was never for open borders. Biden was never for transgender for everyone.

And then I met with all of your leaders, including you, a great leader. He's now the leader of many countries, not just.  But, but I met with a lot of leaders over the last two months in the Middle East and all of the NATO, all of the NATO countries. And I will tell you, they had one common phrase. They thought America was dead one year ago.  And today they say, and they all say it, and I hope you'll back me up on this, but they say now it's the hottest country anywhere in the world. It is. Look at our numbers. Look at the numbers we made. You see, we made $25 billion last month.  We don't we didn't make that for years. The tariffs are kicking in. The economy is very strong, even though we have a Fed person who's terrible. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing, but that's all right. We blew we blow through interest rates. We're doing so well. We blow through it. Be nice, because people would be able to buy housing a lot easier. But think of it.  We thought your country was dead. And they were dealing with China because they were really going to China, but not anymore. But we thought your country was dead, and now you have the hottest country anywhere in the world. So we've done a really good job, and it's an honor to have this man. This man is a star, and he's going to be dealing with another one of my stars, Matt.
