Good morning. I'm California Attorney General Rob Bonta, and I am joined by my colleagues, which I'm very proud to be able to do, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell,  and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Narona. And we're here today to announce the latest lawsuit we filed against the Trump administration for unlawfully and arbitrarily freezing $6.8 billion in education grants owed to states across the nation.  Here in California, nearly 940 million, almost a billion dollars is on the line. Funds, mind you, that Congress lawfully approved and appropriated, as is their job, as is their role in our constitutional democracy, a responsibility given to them by the U.S. Constitution. Congress holds the power of the purse, not the president.  President Trump and Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon have dealt a debilitating blow to our schools, throwing them into chaos just weeks ahead of the first day of school for many districts. Already ongoing summer learning programs have been forced to shut down.  thoughtful strategic budgets, staffing plans, and contracts for the upcoming school year hang in the balance. Sadly, this is just the latest in a long string of unlawful attacks on K-12 education in our country since Trump took office. And make no mistake, our kids are the ones who will suffer the consequences and are suffering the consequences.  In California, more than 5,800,000 children, almost 6 million, stand in the crosshairs of Trump's campaign to demolish education in America. My colleagues and I refuse to stand idly by and allow the president to torch our children's education, care, opportunities, and futures, all the while breaking the law, violating the Constitution,  and trampling over the separation of powers. Before I dive into the details, I want to acknowledge that our lawsuit is the result of the incredible partnership and collaboration of a coalition of 23 attorneys general and two states and each of their teams, including the folks on my team in California, DOJ's Civil Rights Enforcement and Health Education and Welfare sections. So thanks to all the team members that got us to this day. We have the honor and privilege as the attorneys general  talk about the cases and lead our teams, but this is very much a team effort and I'm grateful for everyone's work to get us to this point. Trump and McMahon's actions are hurting children, hurting teachers and schools across the nation, which is why we're standing arm in arm from coast to coast, united in our determination to hold this administration accountable to the fundamentally American principle that every student has the right to equitable access to education.  Trump and McMahon are waging a campaign to sever that access. They've made it clear that they've little regard for the law and no qualms risking our children's academic success and futures. In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks,  Eight of them challenged unlawful attacks on education. This time, the administration froze $6.8 billion in federal funding owed to states, a quarter of which should have been available July 1st. Instead, on June 30th, the U.S. Department of Education sent a three-sentence-long boilerplate email from a nondescript address alerting states that we wouldn't receive the funds we were waiting for. We were relying on, planning to use, and distribute and disperse.  The dismissive note came with little explanation or reasoning, let alone any legal basis. Let's be clear, Trump and McMahon have no right to hold these funds back.  And in doing so, they're jeopardizing critical programs our students, families, and schools rely on, including afterschool and summer learning programs, tutoring to help students in English and math, programs that train and prepare teachers so they're better equipped to teach our kids, support for children learning English, projects to improve our schools, and funding that helps ensure children who move around because their parents are migrant workers don't fall through the cracks or fall behind.  Without the $6.8 billion in nationwide federal funding that's now frozen, districts and schools have been thrown into chaos, left with no choice but to consider pausing or shutting down programs and laying off teachers and staff. Some programs have already been shuttered, including summer programs that were already underway.  The 21st century community learning centers at nearly 700 sites across California are on the line. These centers provide academic enrichment programs to disadvantaged children outside of regular school hours. They help students meet standards in reading and math. And during the summer, they provide meals to students, a lifeline to families in need.  The Migrant Education Program, which serves 78,000 students at 20 regional programs across the state, has been hit hard by this funding freeze and you can be sure the migrant youth and families who rely on it will feel the impact, unfortunately, feel the pain. The California Adult Literacy Professional Development Project, which trains educators who teach adult education, has been instructed to do the bare minimum to stay afloat. They've already had to end or pause contracts with educators and  small businesses. Trump and McMahon are wreaking havoc on our states and schools, rocking families who count on the support and stability of these programs and holding our children back from their full potential. It's unconscionable, unlawful, and can't go unchecked. And it won't. With this lawsuit, my colleagues and I are asking the court to immediately block any attempt to withhold or delay this funding.  Last week I had the opportunity to spend the afternoon at a summer program at Bel Air Park Elementary School in Napa, California. I saw firsthand the care, compassion, education, and programming made possible by the County Office of Education, the school district, and the expanded learning team.  as well as AmeriCorps tutors and mentors. I watched them make minestrone soup in their cooking class and even chopped some onions with them. I saw the art projects they were working on. I saw the exercise that they were getting, including giving me a run for my own money in zombie tag. They called it Z tag. I saw how much the program meant to those kids, how irreplaceable it is for them,  and their families. I talked to volunteers and educators who devoted their careers to teaching and supporting our young kids. Fortunately, so far the county has been able to backfill the federal funding the program didn't get on July 1, but let's be clear that is a band-aid solution.  Their before, after, and summer school programs are all at risk, programs that serve the community's highest need schools. As their associate superintendent said, this freeze is, quote, yet another federal action that introduces pain and uncertainty into the educational system of our community.  Trump may wrongly claim he's going after waste, fraud, and abuse, but the unfortunate irony is the long-term cost of Trump's unlawful attack on our students, families, schools, and communities is tremendous. Working parents will be left without reliable, affordable childcare. Teachers and staff will join the growing throng of unemployed Americans thanks to Trump's anti-worker policies, and students will fall behind.  In 2022, out of 37 developed nations, American students ranked 28th in math and 12th in science. Those numbers don't stand a chance of improving if you slash before, after, and summer school programming, fire tutors, cut programs that teach English and support disadvantaged students, and programs that ensure our teachers are the best they can be and prevent schools from bringing in the technology and resources they need to educate our children.  President Trump can shout America first all he wants, but his anti-education agenda will only ensure we come in dead last.  It shouldn't be too much to ask that the President of the United States follow the law. And yet, we've had to sue him 31 times in 25 weeks for breaking the law, undermining Congress's authority, and failing to make good on federal financial obligations. As a former businessman, you'd think he'd have learned that you can't rack up a list of unpaid debts and get away with it.  Our states are owed the billions in federal funding that Trump and McMahon have frozen, and we're going to court to see that it's reinstated. Before I turn it over to my colleagues to say a few words, I want to shout out the incredible public servants at California DOJ who've worked hard to make today's lawsuit possible. Jewel Boyd, Lee Sherman, Jesse Bassbaum, Elia Herrera, Emilia Morris, Christopher Tenorio, Joshua Sodheimer, Virginia Corrigan, Irina Trasobin. Thank you.  It's an honor to serve alongside each and every one of you. And with that, please allow me to now turn it over to my colleague, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit against the Trump administration for freezing $6.8 billion in education grants.

Thank you, Secretary Kennedy and Secretary Rawlings. We wouldn't be here were it not for both of your vision to make this happen, so thank you. Secretary Rawlings, you've been the perfect partner in this.  We first said we want to remove all nine petroleum-based food dyes from the U.S. food supply and do it soon. The naysayers said it would not be possible. And here we are weeks later with an announcement that nearly 40 percent of food manufacturers have  raise their hand to say, yes, we agree. There are no Democrat or Republican children in America. They are children. And so we can do this because we now have enough reason to be concerned about these petroleum-based food dyes. We don't need to wait for a 10-year randomized controlled trial. Parents are telling us  that when a kid has abnormal behavior and they try reducing or eliminating petroleum-based food dyes, they have seen behavior improve. That is data. May not be a 10-year randomized controlled trial, but if we listen to parents, there are learnings there for the medical establishment. There are also randomized controlled trials also raising these health concerns with the petroleum-based food dyes.  Now, we believe in options, so that means we want natural dyes to be available to food makers and ice cream makers. Normally, every couple years the FDA will spit out one natural food dye approval. But on the charge of Secretary Kennedy, we have made this a priority, and Kyle Diamantis, who's standing here in charge of the food program at the FDA,  has made this a priority such that in the very short time we have been in office, we have now the fourth natural food dye from natural ingredients approved by the FDA. Today, I'm announcing that the FDA is approving Gardenia Blue as a natural food dye with natural ingredients.  We believe in options and we believe in incremental improvements in health. The sickness of American kids is not a willpower problem. It's not their fault. We can do things that will make the food supply healthier one step at a time.  So with that, I just want to reemphasize that this is a renaissance moment in health in America, and part of that is rewriting the broken food and nutrition guidelines of the United States. No longer are we going to have a broken food pyramid and a continuation of a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat that began with Dr. Ancel Keys.  We are going to have dietary guidelines that are based on science, not based on medical dogma.

When Trump said he would deport millions, that incentivized illegals to leave or just stay in their own country. When Trump promotes alligator Alcatraz, that incentivized it even more. Plus it provides the alligator community with much needed jobs. When ICE rounds up illegals at a weed farm, the images go global, encouraging others from not even trying to come here. And Tom Homan just looking at him makes you want to board a bus and go to Tijuana.  He gives off a vibe that shaving cream is for wussies. He's a walking, talking human version of the wall.

Every single day. And also, we've incentivized self-deportation. But that deterrence effect is so massive. And the great thing is, people like Debbie Wasserman Schultz amplifies it by saying how horrible the conditions are. Oh my God, they have to poop and brush their teeth in the same place.

I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. I know Putin very well from the days when I was prime minister. And then once you have to test him, and you did this, and you really gave him a chance to be serious, to get to the table.  Well, as we told you at the top of the program, President Trump is sending additional weapons to NATO countries for distribution to Ukraine. It's part of his effort to try to end the war with Russia. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was on hand for that announcement, as you saw in the Oval Office. He joins us on set tonight. Mr. Secretary General, thanks for being here. Good to be on the program. What's your takeaway from your meeting today and that announcement and how significant it is?  This is really significant. So last Thursday, I got a call from President Trump. He said, hey, Mark, we really want to ramp up the support for Ukraine when it comes to weapons. And then this morning, I was in the White House preparing for the meeting with him. And he said, when it comes to the sanctions, clearly, we have to take the next step now. And he can only dialogue once. So he has to take this step by step. I totally understand that.  But he was really, I think, irritated with his last phone call with Putin, who is not serious, it seems, about getting into peace negotiations. So now there's a 50-day deadline. Essentially, the president put that on the table today. And you think that the sanctions on other countries doing deals with Russia will create additional pressure, exponential?  Absolutely. This is significant. So today if you are in Beijing or in Delhi or you're in Brazil and you know that this is coming to you, you might want to call Vladimir or Vladimir Putin and say, hey friend, we are still buying stuff from you, but you have got to get serious when it comes to these negotiations on a ceasefire or a peace deal, or otherwise we get hit by these secondary sanctions. There will be also an effect directly on Russia, of course.  But this is really significant. And it is smartly designed by the president. What about the weapons themselves? Why not the U.S. directly to Kiev? Why through European countries? Well, there are two sides to this. One is the logistics. And NATO is good at logistics. So get the weapons into Ukraine in a way that they can make maximum use of them. So packaged in packages which are really useful. And for them to be maximum effective. And then, of course, is the issue of who is paying for it. And the president  And I totally understand this. He said, hey, listen, Mark, we want to deliver these weapons into Ukraine, making sure that they can sustain in the fight, that they somehow are able to defend themselves against the Russians. But you guys in Europe have to pay for it. And I think that's fair. We had the NATO summit, which was a huge foreign policy success for President Trump. Europeans stepping up. And here again, the Europeans are stepping up, taking responsibility to pay for these weapons.  You know, Vladimir Putin has shown no indication he's going to stop this. And obviously, you've talked to the president about how much these phone calls have irritated him. We have this chart that shows the number of attacks, drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, sometimes right after these phone calls going up. So what is it going to take? How much more support for Ukraine to get to the table?  negotiating table to push Russia to that point.  Putin now hears from the American President and from the Europeans is that we will do whatever it takes for Ukraine to be as strong as possible when peace deal is taking place or peace negotiations will start to be in the best possible place at that moment. And then on top of that,  the threat of sanctions in 50 days on those who are still buying, like Brazil, India and China, from Russia. So if I was in the Kremlin today, I would not be too happy. Because this is a clear signal that President Trump is serious. He wants peace. He hates the fact that so many people lose their lives in Ukraine.  You mentioned the NATO political success for President Trump. The New York Times writes it this way. Since his first term, Mr. Trump has been pressing for the Allies to spend more on their own defense. After one day meeting in the Netherlands, they agreed to raise their spending on the military to 5% of their national income by 2035. The amount consists of 3.5% on traditional military needs, like troops, weapons, shells, and missiles, up sharply from the current target  of 2%. I mean, describe that for the layperson in America, how big a deal that is, that shift. It really started in the first term with President Trump, but now in this moment. The direct impact, if I was living in America, is more jobs for the middle class. Because this will mean more production lines, more shifts in the great defense industrial base here in the US. Of course, the same in Europe, because we need the defense industrial base across the alliance, from Turkey up to and including California. Well, it will mean more jobs for the middle class in the US.  President Trump was pushing Europeans to get to this famous 2% which was the old target at the beginning of this year. Seven, eight countries were still not on that 2% and they all came in before the summit in The Hague. Spain was not there. Also Spain committed to the 2%.  But now 5% is a little too much for them. They are saying we can get there on a lower percentage. Absolutely not true. They will not be able to do that. They will need to spend the 5%. But OK, we said you show us you can do it for a smaller amount of money, but you will never be able to do that. That's clear. But all 32% have committed to this 5% and to their target.  I think one of the biggest foreign policy successes of President Trump. And it also means that NATO is reinvigorated because it is fairer, we spend the same as the Americans are spending on the European side, and we need it to keep ourselves safe from Russia, which is investing in its defence at a staggering rate.  You said that the US is not secure if the Atlantic, Europe, and the Arctic are not secured. There's an increasing realization, and let's not be naive about it, if Xi Jinping would attack Taiwan, he would first make sure that he makes a call to his very junior partner in all of this, Vladimir Putin, residing in Moscow, and telling him, hey, I'm going to do this, and I need you to keep them busy in Europe by attacking NATO territory. So you see this all linked.  together. And most policy experts see this all linked. Because there was always the thinking the Chinese might attack Taiwan as a sort of isolated incident, which is, by the way, of course, big enough by itself. But it is clear that China is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine together with North Korea and Iran. So this is North Korea, China, Iran working together with the Russians.  And China is doing that for a reason. It gives them leverage over, indeed, their very junior partner, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. And clearly, if they would move on Taiwan, they will force Putin to move on Europe. And for the U.S., NATO is there because, of course, you want Europe to be safe, but in the first place, also, because the U.S. has to stay safe. And therefore, you need a safe and secure Atlantic, Arctic, and Europe. How is President Trump seen around the world by world leaders you deal with?  I think he is very well respected. And I saw in The Hague, at the summit, 31 leaders. So the 32nd, of course, is the US. In itself, by the way, bigger than all the other 31 combined. That is how powerful this country is and this nation is in your military. But the other 31 leaders really recognizing, hey, this is somebody who is absolutely clear what he wants to achieve, is committed to NATO, but he is extremely frustrated about the fact that we are not paying up. And now we are paying up. And therefore, this commitment to NATO is ironclad.

But you know, this is the fun part about President Trump. He came back to the White House, and immediately there was this video released, Daddy is Home. And you see the t-shirt with daddy on it. So he laughed about it. He laughs about it. And that is why I like him so much, because he has that humor and that light touch. And he's a great man. Mr. Secretary General, thanks for the time. Thank you so much. Good to be in the show.  We just watched major, major policy shift from President Trump, who spoke live from the Oval Office, joined by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The president announced he will be allowing Ukraine to purchase more American weapons, including Patriot defense missiles.  And the president tore into Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said, quote, he's very unhappy with Putin and threatened 100% tariffs on Russia if the peace deal is not agreed upon within 50 days. When asked 50 days, why that long? He said, it's really not a long time. I mean, think about it. 100% tariffs could be coming.  They could not sustain that with that economy. This is Outnumbered. I'm Harris Faulkner, here with my co-host, Emily Campagno. Also joining us today, Lisa Booth, Fox News political analyst, Alicia Acuna from the West Coast, Fox News senior correspondent, and Paul Morrow, Fox News contributor, attorney, and retired NYPD inspector and attorney. All right, so Alicia, we look at the situation. We've been covering this for 1,220 days.  So the idea of Ukraine getting crushed and needing more is not specifically new, but President Trump ran in part on saying he would end this. It's 157 days. It's not that long into his presidency, and he's given an ultimatum to a man he once described as having a good relationship with.  Yes, absolutely. And I also find it interesting, and Jackie Heinrich hit on this, that he said it didn't matter to him that the Senate, while it's doing its job and it's doing a good job considering the 500% tariffs on countries that do deals with Russia, right? He's got his own deal going on as well, with 100% tariffs on the table in 50 days. He made it very clear, we're going to hit them and we're going to hit them hard. Some of it's going to come from me, some of it could come from the Senate. But either way, you are dealing with me now.  And he also made it incredibly clear that you are no longer dealing with President Biden. Right. I think it's also important, Paul, that we not pay for this. And that seems to be critical because the president hit that point hard. Let's watch. I am with Russia, but we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with him and we're going to be  doing very severe tariffs. If we don't have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100 percent. You'd call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine. And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it.  And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin, because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago. But it doesn't seem to get there. Paul, $350 billion the U.S. has already spent on this war. And so he's saying no. You guys ponied up for your percentages at the G7 summit recently. That's how they'll get paid for."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 689.594, "text": " This is where Donald Trump's straight-talking rail politic really hits the ground, and it's something he doesn't get a lot of credit for, because the foreign policy intelligentsia, this is all ironed out on the campuses and among the academics, all the think tanks, and they see Donald Trump as some sort of unwashed, uneducated character or something because he doesn't speak their language. Why? Because he speaks plainly and he goes right to the truth. Trump is the first guy that we've seen relative to the Soviet Union, which is what Putin wants to reconstitute.  He's the first guy who's taken NATO back to first principles, which is, we're all in this together, guys. And we're not going to pony up all the money for all of the defense. We've created in Europe a series of defense junkies. And they're all sitting around. I've been over there. Wow.  They're sitting around saying, don't worry about it, guys. It's OK. Because you know what? America will send the 82nd Airborne, and we'll get out of this. Take the money and put it into whatever. And very clearly, that's gone away. And you have to say to yourself, where were our NATO ambassadors all of this time? Did nobody come back?  from Europe come back from The Hague and say, Mr. President, I've got to tell you something. They're all deadbeats. They won't even put up the 2% that they're supposed to put up. You mean with the last administration? Going back even further, the German politicians literally laughed at Donald Trump first time around when he said, you're going to all be beholden to Russian  oil. As far as the tariffs go, one thing I would just say we have to be cautious about. Russia loves to say we can survive anything with self-sufficient. They'll sacrifice a whole generation over there. And they are, right now, a wartime economy. A lot of people fear that if this gets resolved, he'll start another war just to keep his economy going. So right now, the Georgians, the people in the Baltics, they're all very concerned about the fact that if you end this one, we may have another one."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 795.029, "text": " So that's really interesting, Emily, because he doesn't share a border with Germany, but he's across the Baltic Sea from Germany. And the president just said, the country that is talking so strongly about what would happen if Russia doesn't come to a deal and back down is Germany. He said, I won't tell you what we would do, but they're very bold about what they would do. And I wonder if it's not that Baltic proximity that has Germany going, we're also the ones with the most weaponry.  weaponry, rather, so on and so forth. What's your take? Yeah, I think that's why we sort of saw today the signal of this, like, hard-lined renaissance happening in the approach, and the whole point is that this is going to test the allied cohesion, indeed, absolutely that, and then the real impact of economic pressure.  To that point, will it actually work, or will Putin just spin out and start other wars? I thought what was interesting is that as we tip into this next phase, so we have military support for Ukraine. It's structured around financial accountability, and then the stick is sanctions. But the whole point is we're going to see the barriers along the way, the challenges. Do the allies have budgets? Germany has said, we are going to spend a lot.  At a certain point, there's obviously a finite end. Will the tariff timeline hold? Diplomacy with Russia may falter under inflexibility, obviously, because look at what Trump mentioned. We talk on the phone, everything's cool, and then he goes ahead and bombs everyone. So there's not a lot of predictability with that model.  predict with any type of confidence what the other person's going to do. And then I think there might be domestic criticism in just that it might undermine global diplomacy, the argument goes, and then obviously with China weighing in. So I think this is a test, but I know I have my money on the president because he won't falter.  The wild card is Putin. So the politics of this, you know, I mean, what Emily's talking about is true. It's what's going on at home and potentially what kind of pressure that can put on a deal or the president. So we know the United Senate and House can put on their 500 percent tariffs on the countries that do business with Russia. And the president said, well, Senator John Thune's coming over and we're going to talk about that. Now, I assume he means to the White House.  coming over to his house right the people's house but on top of that he says I can do my own deal so that's what you were talking about Alicia and he said and I could put that up to a hundred percent so if if people can't afford to do business with them and they can't afford to do business with us where are they gonna get their stuff  Well, I also think it's smart politically for President Trump to remove us slightly from saying, look, NATO's going to buy these weapons and then distribute them. We're not doing it. And that's also where you see President Trump not just the commander in chief, but the business guy, right? He's always looking out for the bottom line of Americans, with they're going to buy these weapons, getting Ukraine to sign a minerals deal, getting NATO to pay more, increase their spending by 5%.  So we see the business guy in President Trump. Look, I have concerns similar to what Paul expressed about, is this war never ending with Russia and Ukraine? Will it ever end? Russia has a larger military. They have more people to sacrifice at the altar of this war. However, I think President Trump deserves our deference. He's always right. When has he been wrong about foreign policy? His naysayers are the ones. Everyone said there was going to be a World War III.  after, you know, sending those bombs to Iran and taking out some of their nuclear facilities, or at least badly damaging them, that didn't come to fruition, right? So he's repeatedly been... Or, you know, moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Everyone was worried about that, right? So everyone has been wrong. He's always been right. So he deserves our deference. And then also, this is a guy who's really interested in peace, as he pointed out, ending that 30-year war between Congo and Rwanda, which he doesn't get any credit for. So, you know, look, I'm gonna wait and see on this, but I think he has earned our respect.  And he's earned our deference, because he has repeatedly been right, and his naysayers are wrong. Well, look, in India and Pakistan, that we're ready to have a hot war. He ended that in a weekend. Look, real quickly, because I think this is worth knowing. Patriot missiles in certain countries as of 2022. So who else has these, right? So some of them are in NATO, some of them are not. The US, obviously, the Netherlands, which for 14 years, Ruda was their prime minister, so we know that.  We can get a good count on them there. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been going around and calculating where all these things are. Germany has them, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Bahrain, and Switzerland. Just to give an idea of where there are other Patriot missile systems, because that comes into play some of those countries in NATO.

There are some very tough characters over there. They got it at the end of World War II. That's not that long ago in geopolitical time.

Iran has threatened former National Security Advisor John Bolton, as well as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as President Trump. But I also believe that the timing of this alleged crowdfunding and overt threat against the president is deliberate. The United States, with our kinetic strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, re-established escalation dominance.  And Iran, I think, is seeking to gain some leverage to demonstrate that they could potentially hurt us in anticipation of nuclear discussions with us, negotiations over the future of their nuclear program. They don't have any other leverage. We've eliminated that. Israel has destroyed Iran's proxy terrorist network, as well as their air defenses. And we have the upper hand. And I think that's why we're seeing this threat.  I expect President Trump to be working closely with law enforcement as well as the intelligence community just to learn more details about how serious this threat is. But again, we have to be very, very vigilant."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1190.36, "text": " It sounds like that is the case. U.S. Secret Service did pass along a statement to Fox, and it reads, in part, quote, we operate in a heightened and very dynamic threat environment, and the safety and security of the president and all of our protectees remains our highest priority. To preserve operational integrity, we can't comment on specific protective intelligence matters.  However, our teams work around the clock with international, federal, state, and local partners to ensure the highest levels of protection. But to your point, Dan, this was a senior State Department official, an official statement from the State Department on this as well, saying a senior State Department official is telling the Washington Free Beacon that the Trump administration is aware of these threats and committed to, quote, holding bad actors accountable. This means using  every tool at our disposal, including sanctions, to implement the president's maximum pressure strategy.

When it comes to an Israel deal with Hamas, it's possible. But Hamas wants Israel out of the Gaza Strip, and they want a permanent ceasefire. Israel's not willing to do that.  We also don't know what the Gaza Strip is going to look like, what the day after looks like. Israel wants to ensure that there could be no future terrorist threat emanating from Gaza against Israel. And so what I expect is it's possible, through very intense diplomacy from the Trump administration, that we may arrive at some middle ground where we have a short-term ceasefire for 30 or 60 days.  a prisoner exchange where Israel releases perhaps as many as 1,000 Palestinians in return for some of the hostages who are still alive."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1320.1, "text": "This also, before I let you go, as the administration seems to be cranking up pressure on Russia, teasing this major statement or announcement, Dan, today as these drone strikes hit Ukraine, I just want to roll this on President Trump earlier on how he will respond if Putin escalates.

Thank you so much, Dan. Let's bring in now the United States Ambassador to NATO, Matt Whitaker. Thank you very much, Matt, for being here. This was President Trump, more from him, Satwan guys, on this deal. This was in the Oval Office. You were there on this weapons deal to Ukraine. More details, listen.  We've made a deal today where we're going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. The United States will not be having any payment made. We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it and they're going to be paying for it. So what do you want people to know about this deal?  Well, I think it's very important to know, first of all, the days of the United States sending unlimited taxpayer dollars to defend Ukraine are over. President Trump has made a very smart decision, an agreement with NATO, which says  Europe and Canada will pay for the weapons. The United States will manufacture them. Obviously, we make the best weapons systems in the world, and everyone wants them. And we're going to prioritize those going to Ukraine. And what this says also to Vladimir Putin, I think, is very loud and clear, which is, you know, we've given you a chance for peace. President Trump is a peacemaker. But if you want war, we will arm Ukraine, and Europe will pay for it.  It's actually, I think, a great step in ultimately bringing this war to a conclusion, to an end. In the last 18 months, Russia has gained about 1% of Ukrainian land. I mean, they're making no success. They're losing thousands of soldiers every single day. And way too many private citizens in Ukraine and the big cities are being injured. So I think this is a great next step  and finally ending this war. But again, if Vladimir Putin wants to continue to fight on the battlefields of Ukraine, the United States of America will sell Europe armaments so that they can be used by Ukraine to defend themselves. Matt, like his predecessor, Jens Stoltenberg, Mark Rutte appears to be a big fan of the president. Here's what he said after the announcement.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia. But you don't want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit.  I mean, this changes the status quo quite dramatically. It used to be that the Europeans would like to have Ukraine have weapons, but they were very happy to have the United States pay for it. Now they're ponying up for it. So that's different. But how also do you think Putin's going to react to this?  Well obviously he's going to react to not only the United States weapons being readily available to the Ukrainians at Europe's expense. He's also going to respond obviously to this tariff and especially as the people that are enabling of China India and others that are buying his oil. But you know this is a natural progression of what we did in the Hague at the NATO summit too. You know we obviously we  We move the burden off the American taxpayer for European defense and on to European taxpayers, where it should be. And the traditional defense of Europe is now going to be borne by the European population. And at the same time, we're doing the same thing with the Ukrainian war. You know, President Trump said today $350 billion of American taxpayers' money has gone to support Ukraine. No longer. But at the same time, we're not cutting them off from weapons, and we're also  also not making the United States of America less secure. We're going to make sure that strategically we have enough that we need and then anything else that we can make, manufacture and sell to our European allies and give to Ukraine I think is a perfect and elegant solution for this.  And now there's this idea of secondary tariffs, 50-day deadline. This may be the leverage that President Trump thinks he has with Vladimir Putin in Russia. And to John's point about this relationship with the NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, President Trump has spoken very highly of their relationship in the past. Here's just more of a sampling from the Oval Office, an exchange on this war, and it just keeps going on and on. Listen.  I felt, I don't know about you, Mark, but I felt that we had a deal about four times. And here we are, still talking about it. And he didn't send serious people to the negotiations. We thought, and I thought, we should have had a deal done a long time ago. But it just keeps going on and on.  Feel free to weigh in on that, Matt, but also having been in that Oval Office when all of this was going down, how important is it that they really seem to have developed a very strong relationship, the two of them?  Yeah, and obviously, Secretary, General Secretary Rutte is a very good politician. He was 14 years as the Dutch prime minister, and he knows how European politics works, and he can obviously bring people to the table in Europe. Obviously, President Trump is the master dealmaker, and I think he saw an opportunity here to not only, you know, bring jobs to middle America through making weapons systems. You know, I've seen some of those manufacturing  the U.S.  And I look, you know, every day that I work with him is enjoyable because he's such a professional and he is equally working hard to make NATO strong and make, most importantly, Europe strong. Because President Trump said it today when we were talking to him. And that is, is that a Europe, a strong Europe, a Europe that can deter Russia, frees up the United States to address all of our strategic concerns across the globe. And that's a good thing for everyone.  I mean, it is so interesting to see opponents of the president whining about him, insisting that NATO nations pony up and do their share. But the people who seem to like it are the people who are running NATO. Matt, great to catch up with you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Matt. Thank you. Meantime, senior White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich was at today's event in the Oval Office. She starts us off inside the White House briefing room. Good evening, Jackie.  Good evening, Brett. The president, who sharply criticized past assistance to Ukraine, often calling Zelensky a salesman, insulated himself from criticism over this policy shift, emphasizing that he's authorizing the sale of U.S. weapons to NATO allies, whose leaders he also praised after they stepped up their defense commitments. We had a deal about four times.  President Trump is stepping up Ukraine's defenses with billions of dollars worth of US weapons bought and distributed by NATO allies. Trump now fed up with Putin's games. My conversations with him are always very pleasant. When I tell the first lady, you know, I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation. She said, oh, really?  Another city was just hit. So it's like, look, he's, I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. Trump also giving Putin 50 days to reach a deal or face 100% secondary sanctions on any country doing business with Russia, a hefty consequence for major purchasers of Russian oil like China and India. The package is separate from the 500% secondary sanctions leaders in the Senate and House have been withholding for Trump's green light.  I'm not sure we need it, but it's certainly good that they're doing it. And I think they've actually crafted a pretty good piece of legislation that's probably going to pass very easily, and that includes Democrats. The president said Ukraine should begin receiving Patriot missile systems within days, replacements now heading to NATO countries as soon as this afternoon, a major development after the Pentagon briefly paused arms deliveries for a stockpile review early this month, an apparent surprise to the president. So who ordered the pause last week?  I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Trump indicated today this impending deal played a role. I knew what Pete was doing was evaluation because we knew this was going to happen. Obviously, that has a big impact on, you know, when you say a pause. Obviously, you're not going to be doing things if you don't know what's going to happen here. But we were pretty sure this was going to happen, so we did a little bit of a pause.  A White House official tells Fox the president ordered a review of U.S. stockpiles following the Iran strikes, and Pentagon officials believed that they were adhering to the president's wishes when they paused those arms deliveries for the purposes of that review, but there was no broader policy decision to pause military aid to Ukraine. Brett.  Jack Hanrak, live in the White House Briefing Room. Jackie, thank you. You think that the sanctions on other countries doing deals with Russia will create additional pressure, exponential? Absolutely. This is significant. So today, if you are in Beijing, or in Delhi, or you're in Brazil, and you know that this is coming to you, you might want to call Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and say, hey, friend, we are still buying stuff from you. But you have got to get serious when it comes to these negotiations on a ceasefire or a peace deal. Or otherwise, we get hit.  by the secondary sanctions.  President Trump stepping up the pressure there. You see the NATO Secretary General on set. Axios writes it this way, Trump to supply missiles to Ukraine gives Russia a 50-day ultimatum. This is a seismic policy shift from President Trump, who originally refused to side with Ukraine and until very recently insisted he would only supply defensive weapons so as not to escalate the war. Trump also said he was giving Russia 50 days to make a deal or else face 100% secondary tariffs, seemingly referring to a plan to impose tariffs on countries like China and India.  that by Russian oil, that would have a major impact on global oil markets. With that, let's bring in our panel, Fox News contributor Mary Catherine Hamm, Dasha Burns, White House Bureau Chief for Politico, and Guy Benson, also a Fox News contributor. All right, Mary Catherine, seems like it is a big turning point and may make a big difference.  Yeah, I went back to 2018 actually to reflect on how we got here when Trump first went to NATO and five countries were committing 2% at that point. And now you've got this big shift that the Secretary General noted with everybody but Spain saying we can get to 5%. And I think that's interesting because I was a person who back then thought, was worried about his rhetoric on NATO and who still worries about his rhetoric on Ukraine and Russia. But he has created a situation where he can do this deal that puts pressure on  Putin, because I think he feels like he's been worked over a little bit in that area. And he can do it in a way that is politically fine for him to do, even with his base, because Europe is paying for it, and strategically helpful to Ukraine, which is what I'm looking for. Yeah. Dasha, it is a change for this White House in positioning. And the question is, what happens after the 50 days? Does he agree to this Lindsey Graham bipartisan bill to put the pressure on, or does he do it himself?  Well, I just spoke to a senior White House official about just that, Brett. And the point here is I asked whether the shift was due to something. Did Putin say something? Did something happen? And they said, no, look, it's just time. And Russia at this point is now committing some of the worst atrocities against civilians of this entire war. And Trump feels like he's been tapped along by Putin. At the same time, Trump does feel like  Putin is the bigger fish with the upper hand here, and so he doesn't want to go full blunt force trauma against Russia right away, which is why we've really seen him hedge on this idea of sanctions. What I know is behind the scenes, the White House is very much in contact with Lindsey Graham about this, but they want the language change to give Trump the ultimate say, to give him the maximum optionality so that it's on the table, he can threaten Putin with it, but if Putin comes to the negotiating table in full good faith, then maybe it's a different story.  You know, the NATO Secretary General said the president gave Putin chances on multiple phone calls, but then noticed the attacks that came right after those phone calls as an affront to him and to the thought that he's going to get to the table.

There's a MAGA rebellion over the Epstein outcry. The split over Epstein represents one of the biggest rifts within the Trump supporters since the president took office for a second term.

But Trump's DOJ and FBI have concluded that there's no evidence for either. Mary Catherine.  Yeah, I think there's a couple things going on here. Many, many, many people look at this and go, on its face, it looks like it was handled at least incompetently, if not corruptly, from day one, regardless of leadership. And they want answers because there are real victims who we will probably never know much about because they signed NDAs and because very powerful people were involved.  And also, there was an easy answer for the Trump administration here, which was, Ghislaine Maxwell is appealing. We cannot release anything while that is ongoing, right? I think that would have been the clean answer. Now they're in this situation where a bunch of people are deeply invested in this particular story, which there may be plenty more to, as a decoder ring for all that is corrupt in government. And if they don't get answers on that, they'll be very mad. Here's the other thing, though. There's a large portion of that portion of the base that will listen to Trump when they give him, when he gives them an answer on this.  And the question is, how politically salient is that? And does he have the benefit of the doubt?  Here's the tension. The White House wants to move on from this. One senior official tells me that they understand it's important to the base, and that doesn't mean they're going to ignore it, but they want to move past it. They also feel like this is very much an online kind of outrage, not that the issue is not important to the base, but that the outcry and the rage factor is very much an online thing led by these influencers. But the reality of it is that the people in Middle America that voted for Trump  are not as invested in this as they are in the economy and health care. The other piece of it is, the more that this administration doesn't want to talk about this, the more that online group wants to talk about it and shout about it and feels like there's more of a there there.

And there was young women involved in this, young girls that were trafficked and abused. I have four daughters, and I have granddaughters. And I just don't like it. And anybody that's involved in this should be held accountable. I recently interviewed Paul Hutchinson.  who was a major figure in the Sound of Freedom. He was one of the ones that went to rescue, I think, 51 or 52 of these young girls and young boys that were being exploited and trafficked. I mean, this has got to stop. And if these people are not held accountable, it's just going to continue. And, unfortunately, it seems like it's people with power and money. It seems that, from what my investigation,  you know, that this Les Wexner was the first one that Epstein was able to bribe. And, you know, there's a lot of stuff here that needs to come out, and it's really shameful if it doesn't. That's my opinion.

And that's the crux of the prima facie case here in the habeas.  What the determination that Judge Ryan needs to make is, is there evidence that either wasn't available at the time that should have gone to the jury that would have changed their verdict? And what Mr. Hockman has wrong is that Leslie Abramson always, as part of her defense in this case, always argued that it was imperfect self-defense.  that yes, the brothers killed their parents because they thought they were going to be killed, but an imperfect self-defense allows the jury to understand that they might have been wrong. Even though they were wrong in believing that they were going to be killed, they still believed it.  And if they believed it and were wrong, it's not a complete self-defense, but it does lower the conviction from a murder to a manslaughter. And in their second trial, they were not allowed, the jury was not allowed to consider the manslaughter, they were not allowed to consider the imperfect self-defense.  So, the way that the sexual abuse plays into that is that because of the abuse by their parents, because of the father's sexual abuse and because of their mother sanctioning this abuse, creating this hallway rule where adults and family members were not allowed to go down the hallway if one of the children was in the room with Jose, this terrible, terrible thing that both of these parents did, because of that abuse,  Psychologically, these children were in fear of these parents and believed, even if it may have been incorrect on that day, that these parents were going to kill them and that the only way out was to kill them themselves.

This judge is basically going through the steps. And the steps for the habeas petition, and this habeas petition was filed in May of 2023, is that you first ask for an informal response from the prosecution. So we provided an informal response back in February of 2025, at which point we wrote an 80-page-plus brief explaining why the new evidence, this is  evidence that supposedly didn't exist before the trial, couldn't be obtained before the trial, is new, it's admissible, and it's significant enough to warrant a brand new trial. We explain in this 80 plus page submission why it wasn't new, why it wasn't admissible, why it wasn't material, why it wasn't significant, and therefore it shouldn't justify a new trial.

They have been firing missiles at a rate never seen before in the three years of the war. And it almost seems like Putin has been pursuing this mad moment, if you will,  of sending as many of these things as possible. And they're not all aimed at military targets, primarily hitting civilian targets, things like that. Other things that are on the order going out are what they call defensive weapons. Now, there's a lot of interpretation on what that can mean, but artillery rounds  certainly are well in there and you know I would mention we've sent about 3 million artillery rounds over to Ukraine during the course of war so that's something they desperately need. Certain types of HIMARS may be on the list, I think they are. There are some, there's a version  of a new missile that we have that can be fired through the HIMARS system. We haven't even sent that to our closest allies in NATO yet, but that's something Ukraine has asked for. It has about a 500 kilometer range. If that thing gets released, that's a significant shift in US policy. But basically all the things that you would expect, and mostly ammunition type stuff.

I've heard of a few other countries that are in, that are paying, that will be paying for buying those weapons from the U S now the question, uh, comes to my mind is what will we charge?  It might be we charge a very discount rate for this purpose as well. That's very possible. There is a lot of latitude on what we can charge for weapons, and certainly if it's something we have in the inventory, what we can charge. But this is actually kind of going back to something we've heard from President Trump and those around him for quite some time, is that the European countries need to start pulling their weight and providing more support for NATO.  What this does is it addresses a defense industrial base shortfall within Europe. I'm not saying the U.S. is healthy in this regard. We have a lot of work to do to rebuild our defense industrial base, but Europe is much further behind us. So they're not in a position where they can suddenly start producing weapons at the rate to support Ukraine with what Ukraine needs. So now it's okay.

That's been drawing down. There's not a lot of that fun left, but there still was some of that fun left. So some of those weapons, particularly the Patriot missiles, are from that. Now, the thing they just announced, this is new.  This will be on top of whatever that is. And I will say the Europeans have been stepping up really fast. In fact, I saw an estimate some weeks back that said they'd actually filled the gap in terms of contribution towards buying weapons for Ukraine that the U.S. used to fill.  And so that was pretty big. But this actually addresses that other problem, which is how do you get the weapons? And again, it goes back to the ability of these NATO European countries to produce weapons that Ukraine needs. And particularly the fact is, you know, a Patriot missile, there's only one place you get a Patriot missile. That's from the U.S. All right. That's our missile. So they have to get that.

It's been helping their economies because they're able to buy this cheap Russian oil. Of course, it's dangerous for the whole world because the Russians ship it in these, what they call shadow tankers, these dilapidated old tankers that are not particularly seaworthy. And they're running around the world with their automated identification systems turned off because they don't want anybody to know that they're  extremely dangerous for maritime commerce. Basically, what this would do is potentially shut that whole thing down, and that would cause a massive crunch in revenue going to Russia. Russia is, to use the late Senator John McCain's expression, is basically a big gas station. They are a petrostate.  And they are running out of places they can sell their oil. And this makes them run out of pretty much every place that they can sell their oil. So that's part of it. The other thing is, I would mention a former prime minister of Russia, Mikhail Khrushchev today, actually came out and talked about the Russian economy.

Now, I do think that where they are opening themselves up for a little bit of trouble is the fact that we've basically been given a window into this very convoluted system in which aides would be basically passing information  from one aid to another to the point where there's basically, you know, this multifaceted, you know, group of people that are, you know, finally getting this to the to the to the final stages for, you know, signing the the auto pen. So I think that they're leaving themselves open, at least in part from the political side, where  As Republicans like James Comer are going through these interviews in the coming days, especially with Anthony Bernal, they're going to be able to ask them questions, especially related to the way that, say, Chief of Staff Zients was basically signing off on the use of the auto pen and how there were basically lower aides that were creating blurbs sort of as the justification for using the auto pen.

And something that's very interesting is that Biden's use of the auto pen stems far back into the early days of his presidency, whenever he was signing proclamations at first. It really wasn't until, I believe, the first year of his presidency, I believe on a trip to Israel where he used the auto pen  kind of as it is usually intended for, which is to sign legislation while you're away from the office. But as it turns out, we began to see later into Biden's presidency, there were days whenever he was even at the White House,  where he was having the auto pen being signed. That's according to information that's been obtained and released from the Oversight Project, formerly part of the Heritage Foundation, but they uncovered on at least seven different occasions. There were times whenever Biden was working at the Oval Office, but he still had things signed with auto pen. Therein lies where Republicans start to get suspicious because they think to themselves, kind of like we were just mentioning before, if it's supposed to be something that is convenient and for ease,  Well, one can make also an argument that it's just as easy to use your own hand to sign a signature on something, especially if you're at work that day. So I think that that's where people start, especially Republicans, start to look at the issue and wonder to themselves, was there something else happening here? Were there more aides that were doing this, perhaps unbeknownst to the president? And I think that that's where, especially Republicans like, say in Comer's camp,  want to see the Justice Department look into this as well. And I'll say this, you know, last week, whenever we saw Biden's doctor plead the fifth, there was a bit of a discussion about whether I remember Mike Lee, Senator Mike Lee from Utah was asking, why don't we just give Biden's doctor immunity if he's going to plead the fifth?

OK, we want to head to Texas now, where there are new concerns as heavy rains threaten to bring more flooding to the areas hardest hit by those recent deadly storms. This as new reporting reveals details about the response to the floods at Camp Mystic, where dozens tragically lost their life. NBC's Morgan Chesky has more.  Tonight, dangerous downpours threatening the Texas Hill Country, with flood watches covering areas in recovery mode. The death toll statewide from the flooding, now more than 130 people, as new details emerge about the crucial moments the waters rose.  at 1.14 a.m. on July 4th. A family spokesman tells NBC News Dick Eastland, the owner of Camp Mystic, received a National Weather Service alert on his cell phone. The spokesman says Eastland then walked outside to assess the property, called family on walkie-talkies, and between 2 and 2.30 a.m., staff began moving campers to the Mystic Rec Hall. Eastland later died in the floods.  Following the tragic loss of life, growing scrutiny over the lack of warnings from officials, who are the only ones able to tell residents to evacuate or shelter in place. It wasn't like a tornado. It wasn't like a hurricane even. It lasted all day. We asked Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice on who has authority to issue alerts at a city level.  What person would that be? So ultimately, it's me. Ultimately, I have the ultimate authority to be able to make those decisions based on that. Rice adding he was managing rescues and says other local officials can also blast out citywide warnings. Did you issue one? Yeah. So I did not. But that does not mean that something did or did not get issued. I don't know. We haven't dove into looking at the after action stuff. Officials say full reviews are still coming. Until then, the search for the missing, now in its second week.  These divers clearing off debris above before scouring the murky depths below. A painstaking process for closure that may never come. And Morgan joins us tonight live from Kerrville, Texas. Morgan, what do those flood warnings tonight mean for the search and recovery effort?  Yeah, Tom, well, authorities have said that volunteers needed to vacate this river area because the levels are still high. They're telling all of those individuals to stay on higher ground. But as for the search and rescue crews or recovery crews, unfortunately, you can see they are still absolutely in this river, even though that there are hazards beneath the water here, Tom. They have been scouring this stretch of the riverbank here on the Guadalupe. And unfortunately, Tom, with more rain in the forecast, that could pose an issue for them.  But just a testament to their tireless work. And you have yet another helicopter flying up above us. Tom, it feels like this has really been a nonstop effort since this flood began, now 11 days ago here. Unfortunately, that number missing, not dropping as fast as families would like. But the one thing we continue to hear from these crews that are out on this river every single day is they're going to stay here as long as it takes to try to make that closure happen here. Tom?  All right, Morgan Chesky for us. Morgan, we thank you for that. I want to get right over to NBC New York meteorologist Violeta Yaas, who joins us tonight here on Top Stories. So it has been relentless for parts of Texas right now, and millions across the East Coast are at risk for flash floods. What are you tracking tonight?  It has been a very rough rush hour across the northeastern U.S. with torrential, slow-moving downpours now advancing across that I-95 corridor. You can see numerous flash flood warnings in effect. We're seeing not only that, but we've got flood watches in effect through this evening, impacting 46 million people. You can see that really includes that whole I-95 corridor. So we've been seeing this all afternoon long.  This is going to be the focus through the next couple of hours. It's not just the amount of rain, but the fact that these thunderstorms are very slow moving in a very densely populated area of the country, the most densely populated area. So this has been causing big issues as delays have been piling up here across some of our major airports, D.C., Baltimore, up through Philadelphia, Newark, LaGuardia and JFK as well. So very stormy afternoon.  We can expect potentially significant flooding here. That's going to be the bullseye area, unfortunately, from D.C. up through Philadelphia into the New York City area as well. In terms of how much rain we're talking, you can see a general injure or so, but locally in some of those heavier downpours.  We're talking totals on the order of three to five inches of rain, certainly enough to cause flooding, especially when you're talking about a short period of time. So expect very difficult travel here through the next several hours. It's certainly a situation where if you don't need to be heading out the door, you definitely don't want to do that. So very unsettled weather here through this evening, very heavy downpours in the forecast here, really through tonight before conditions start to improve as we head into tomorrow.  All right, Violeta, let's talk about the Gulf now and what's happening just off the east coast of Florida, but why we're tracking it tonight.  Yeah, I actually do have an update for you. We now have tropical disturbance at 93 L invest that essentially formalizes this as an area that we're going to be watching. Still hasn't developed into a tropical storm or anything like that, but conditions are going to be favorable through the next couple of days. So this is going to be tracking across Florida into the Gulf the next couple of days. So if it does intensify, this would become Dexter through the remainder of this week.  Now, the rainfall totals here, you can see on the order of three to five inches locally, even more from parts of central and southern Florida, extending right through the panhandle into the remainder of the Gulf States. So this is an area that does need to be on alert through the next couple of days. Is there enough room, enough time for this to sort of develop into something potentially deadly?  We do have some time for this to intensify. It's possible. It doesn't necessarily do so before tracking across Florida. But once this moves into the Gulf and we've seen this time and time again, those very warm water temperatures, conditions are favorable in this particular area for that intensification. So we'll need to watch out for that. But another thing we've seen through the last several years is that you don't want to get too hung up on the exact categorization because this is going to provide  very heavy rainfall, and the potential for flooding in all of these areas, regardless of whether or not it does formally intensify into a tropical storm eventually. All right, Violeta, yes, we thank you so much for being here tonight. In Washington, President Trump announcing a new plan to rearm Ukraine as Russia intensifies its attacks on the country.

Maggie joins us now live. Maggie, a couple questions for you. First, you mentioned that state trooper who was shot and injured. And then I was also thinking about what you just reported there at the end. How did he get all these weapons if he had these prior convictions? Tom, we know of one possibility. We talked about that protective order that reportedly an ex-girlfriend just filed here earlier this month. In it, she wrote, among the other factors that kind of tie to his escalating behavior, she said that he had broken into her home and stolen her guns  plural. Now, police were asked today whether or not they knew or could say whether where he got his weapons and they declined to do so. So we can't definitively tie that to the shooting, but obviously it's a distinct possibility based on that document. As far as the trooper is concerned, authorities are not naming him, but just saying that he has serious injuries. But tonight an update is stable and recovering at a local hospital.

We are back in just a moment.  Back now with Top Stories news feed. The Supreme Court today said President Donald Trump may proceed with his plans to carry out mass layoffs at the Department of Education in the latest win for the White House. The justice is lifting a lower court ruling that put an indefinite pause on Trump's plan while legal challenges play out.  Trump ordered mass layoffs at the department earlier this year, cutting its workforce in half. But lower courts have blocked that effort, noting that the education department was created by Congress in a scathing dissent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision, quote, indefensible. Here in New York City, four kids were spotted by police drones riding on top of train cars. It's a dangerous trend known as subway surfing. Two of the boys were only 12 years old.  hard to believe. Police boarded the train and all four kids were taken into custody. The incident comes after a 15-year-old boy was killed on July 4th while subway surfing. Police and MTA officials believe the practice has increased in recent years due to social media urging people not to glamorize it. Former Major League Baseball player Dan Serafini has been found guilty  of murdering his father-in-law and trying to murder his mother-in-law after a 2021 Tahoe area home ambush and shooting. The motive, according to the prosecution, was rooted in longstanding family tensions and financial disputes. Key testimony came from Serafini's wife, Erin Spore, who said she didn't believe the family's disagreements could lead her husband to commit murder. In addition to murder and attempted murder, Serafini was found guilty of first-degree burglary. His sentencing set for August 18th.  And police in Richmond Heights, Ohio, capturing the moment three women twerked on a cop cruiser, then using a facial recognition platform, they identified them. Take a look at this. So dash cam video shows a woman climbing onto the car with others. Later joining police say the brazen act, which involved this type of dancing you see here, happened back in June. It damaged the vehicles because of that twerking with dents and scratches. A detective telling us with the use of Clearview AI facial recognition, they were able to identify  to identify two of the women who were twerking. Warrants are out for their arrest. They're still searching for a third. Okay, and a paraglider making it out unscathed after a run-in with a power line in North Dakota. This is pretty incredible. The paraglider flying steadily until you see this coming in close with those power lines, setting off the sparks, then plunges into the Red River. Crews are able to rescue the paraglider, helping him to get to shore. Thankfully, he was unharmed. Incredible he survived that. Okay, to Atlanta now in a major theft.  music world. Atlanta police say hard drives containing unreleased Beyonce music were stolen during a car break-in last week. The hard drives also included footage plans for Queen B's show and future set lists. For more on this, I want to bring in NBC's Priscilla Thompson, a proud member of the Beehive. Priscilla, thank you for this. So talk to us more about the break-in. I mean, this could be pretty huge, especially if it is all of Beyonce's stuff and they end up putting it somewhere on the Internet.  Yeah, Tom, incredibly huge, especially for such a high profile celebrity as Beyonce. We have obtained the incident report that shows that this happened last Tuesday, just as she was kicking off her Atlanta leg of the Cowboy Carter tour. And it happened at Crog Street Market, which is this very popular food hall in Atlanta. Now, according to Beyonce's choreographer, Christopher Grant, and also a dancer, D'Andre Bleu, they pulled into this market at around eight o'clock at night  An hour later, they went out to the car, and they noticed that the window towards the trunk was damaged. And they found that two suitcases were missing. And inside those suitcases were hard drives that contained watermarked music, unreleased music, footage plans for past and future shows, and also set lists.  We know that in addition to all of those very important things to Beyonce, I'm sure there were also laptops, headphones, different kinds of electronics. So lots of questions about why that would have been left in a vehicle in a parking garage, but definitely not something that such a high profile celebrity would want to fall into the wrong hands. Yeah, no, I hear you. And Priscilla, do we think this was random or do we think that they were targeted, like they knew these people worked for Beyonce?  That is definitely the big question. Now, police have not said whether it was random or targeted. But what is interesting that, you know, a lot of folks have the Find My app that connects all of their Apple electronics. And so police were actually able to ping the headphones and the computers, and they sent out, like, multiple units to this area. We know that they interviewed a man in this area and that they were also looking at a vehicle that appeared to be moving as the items that they were tracking were also moving.  And what's more, there is video, police say, that this parking garage had video cameras. The entire incident was caught on video. We know that they took fingerprints at the garage. And police have said that they have issued a warrant for the arrest of the suspect. But they say that an I.D. is, quote, not yet available for release. So unclear if they have that identity and just aren't releasing it to the public yet. But, obviously, it comes as Beyonce is  probably about to take the stage any minute now for her final concert in Atlanta before the tour moves on. Tom? Yep. All right, Priscilla Thompson, we appreciate that reporting. Next tonight to Tesla's new legal battle over its autopilot driving system. A 2019 Florida case where a woman was killed when a Tesla crashed into her parked car, now at the center of a federal trial. The jury seated today must decide if the company bears responsibility for the fatal accident. NBC's George Solis has some of the details.  Tonight, Tesla on trial. In a first for Elon Musk's electric car company, Tesla will now have to defend itself before a federal jury against claims its driver assistance technology is to blame for a deadly 2019 crash in the Florida Keys. Those fateful moments caught on the Tesla's own cameras. In a lawsuit brought by the victim's family, the plaintiff's attorneys say the driver was using the electric car's autopilot, which failed to detect the substantial profile of the Chevy SUV parked at an intersection.  It goes on to say the vehicle struck the Tahoe at almost 70 miles per hour, causing it to violently rotate.

I woke up in the hospital.  and I didn't know what happened to me. The aftermath also captured on police body cameras. The Tesla's driver admitting to taking his eyes off the road moments before the crash as he searched for his phone, according to court documents. The core of the case centering on whether Tesla is liable when its autopilot tech is involved in a crash and how it was marketed to drivers, according to the lawsuit.  In 2016, the company posting this video of a Tesla appearing to drive itself. The text on screen reading, the person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself. Today, the company warns that autopilot is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel. Tesla has denied responsibility for the 2019 crash. In a statement to NBC News, Tesla says in part, the crash had nothing to do with Tesla's autopilot technology,  Instead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cell phones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver. Tesla's autopilot system has faced legal challenges as recent as last year. In three separate California cases, Tesla either settled or was found not liable. Getting into the robo-taxi. The outcome could not only threaten Tesla's reputation, but also impact its self-driving footprint as it begins a push for robo-taxis nationally. Musk himself did not appear in the courtroom today.  All right, with that, George Solis joins us tonight from Miami. So, George, the jury already seated today. What do we know about the makeup of the jury, and how long do we expect this trial involving Tesla to last? Yeah, Tom, the jury was just elected in a couple of hours. It's made up of six women and three men, and some of them were weeded out during some of the questioning, saying they couldn't participate because of their feelings about Elon Musk. Others saying they were just supporters of Tesla and Elon. Now, this whole trial is expected to take about three weeks.  Tom. All right, George Solis first. George, thank you.

Kevin, thanks so much for being here. So Kevin, Cuomo just quoted his grandfather, learn the lesson, pick yourself up, and get back in the game. But he lost by double digits in the primary, so what lesson did he learn here?  It seems some of it comes down to tactics. Cuomo ran during this primary campaign what could be likened to essentially a Rose Garden strategy. Even though he wasn't the incumbent, he was certainly running as the former governor with basically universal name ID, whereas Zoran Mamdani was very much on the ground. It was a tactical campaign. He was out interacting with the public. And today in that video and in a statement that Cuomo sent out to his supporters, he basically said that he was not aggressive enough  in that early campaign. And so he seems to be trying to take on a different approach. The other thing that was notable in the comments that he made in that video is he talked about affordability, which was really the hallmark of the Mamdani campaign. It wasn't necessarily something that Cuomo made front and center of his. So is he adopting some of that language? That seems to be somewhat of the approach here.  Does he have a point, though? I mean, if only 12% of the voting electorate participated in that primary election, I mean, is there a chance? He's got a chance.  I mean, he comes in as basically the most well-known man in New York City, arguably, though Mamdani, if you look at some of the preliminary polling, and it's very preliminary, still has the edge here. The major foil for Cuomo is that he is seemingly fighting for the same pool of voters as some of the other unaffiliated candidates or third-party candidates that are in this race, including the sitting mayor, Eric Adams.  as well as a Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa. And so if they're all fighting for the same piece of the pie, that does give Mamdani, it seems, again, preliminary polling, but does give him certainly a lane where he can kind of fight for his own way to win this. And if you have so many candidates, you don't have to get 50% to win, you just need to have the most.  Yeah, let's talk about a controversy involving Mamdani right now. He's facing the past few weeks. He has said previously that he doesn't consider himself black or African-American, despite being born in Uganda and living there for years. And yet, the New York Times has learned through hacked documents shared with the paper, Mamdani identified as both Asian and African-American on an application to Columbia University. Mamdani, of course, put his Muslim faith and South Asian descent front and center in his campaign. How is this revelation playing with New Yorkers?  There certainly seems to be some voters that are saying this is a bit of a bridge too far, but this of course does come in as Mondani has faced criticism on various other fronts, including his lack of a desire, or at least a lack of willingness, to condemn, for example, the idea of globalize the Intifada. There are these various aspects of Mondani that some voters are clearly not very comfortable with. One of the things that he is trying to do right now, and he's doing this to some degree with some success,  is to basically get all of the mainstream front and center Democrats behind him as they go into now the general campaign. Whereas Cuomo had a lot of endorsements from, for example, labor unions and other groups during the primary, they're now lining up behind Mamdani.  One of the key folks to keep an eye on, at least that I'm watching here in Washington, is Congressman Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer. Jeffries is not yet endorsed, nor has Schumer, and Jeffries is set to have a conversation with Mamdani in person at the end of the week. Obviously, he is the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, could be Speaker of the House, depending on how some key races fall next year. When Mayor Eric Adams ran and won, he ran on crime. He's a former police officer. What is the top issue, you think, in this race?  At this point, at least it seems, and if anything you can take away from the primary, it seems that affordability is front and center. Whereas back in 2022 or 2020, what year is it now? 2021 rather, really front and center was we were coming out of the COVID pandemic. There was a peak in crime. And so part of Adams' successful message as a former member of the NYPD was I'm going to push back on crime.  Now we've kind of turned the corner on some of those crime rates, and it seems that the affordability crisis, the inability to afford rent, and so forth, might be really the defining mark for this race. It's going to be an interesting race, and there's a lot of months. I'm sure there'll be investigations and articles and a lot of opal research in that time. So great to have you on the show tonight, Kevin Frey. We appreciate it.  No problem, Tom. Elmo's World now causing controversy. The ex-account for the beloved Sesame Street character posting a string of racist and anti-Semitic comments over the weekend. Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind the popular children's show confirming Elmo's account, had been hacked.  NBC's Melanie Zenona has been following this for a while and joins me now. Melanie, thanks for joining Top Story tonight. I thought Elmo might be too young to be on X, but apparently not. He has an account. In all seriousness, though, break down this for us and also why this is so sad, right, for X.  Yeah, this all started on Sunday when Elmo's account began posting this very hateful and racist content. It also posted some derogatory comments about President Donald Trump in connection to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Now, we should know that NBC News was not able to independently verify these posts before they were deleted. But Sesame Workshop, that's the nonprofit behind Elmo and Sesame Street, did put out a statement confirming that the account was hacked, although it is still unclear at this point who was behind the hack. I want to read you part of their statement. They said,  Elmo's ex-account was compromised today by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including anti-Semitic and racist posts. We are working to restore full control of the account.\" And since that statement, it does appear that they have been able to regain control and secure that account. The posts were deleted. His bio, Elmo's bio, was restored. But this caused quite the nightmare on Sesame Street. A beloved Muppet in character  that really did, you know, he's done these other things in the past, gone viral for starting a mental health conversation, saying, Elmo checking in, how are you doing? So just a very sad sort of situation to see play out here. Yeah, those hackers are pretty heartless. I do want to ask you, this is sort of the second or third or fourth hate speech scandal to hit X in under a week, coming just days after Elon Musk's AI chatbot made a series of anti-Semitic posts which have since been deleted. Does Elon Musk or the team behind X show any signs of cracking down?  Well the AI company that's behind Grok did issue apology for what they called horrific behavior on the platform. The company also said they did conduct an internal investigation and they determined that the root cause was an update to the code path upstream of the Grok bot. However it isn't clear what additional measures or crackdowns they're going to take.  to prevent this from happening again. And this is not the first time that we've actually seen this type of hateful comments popping up on the GROK chat bot itself. And so there is also going to be a resignation we already saw from X, the CEO of X, stepping down. They also did introduce a new version of GROK, GROK4, right after  these alarming posts, but there are still calls for more accountability to prevent the platform from not only spreading this hate speech, but from providing it itself. Yeah, and before you go, Mellie, since we have you here, it's sort of in the same vein. All of this happening as the Senate is expected to vote this week on whether or not to take back funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports children's programming like Sesame Street. Is there any talk of a possible connection here to this?  Well, these cuts had actually been in the work for quite some time on Capitol Hill. Both PBS and NPR have been top targets of Trump, who's really pushing Congress to get this over the finish line and get it to its desk this week. But Tom, I got to tell you, there are Republicans who have concerns with this bill. There are Republicans like Susan Collins who have concerns with the cuts to foreign aid programs. And then you have other Republicans who are concerned with the cuts to PBS and NPR, which they say are crucial.  to providing not only news, but also weather alerts to rural areas, which, of course, is top of mind after those horrific floods in Texas last week. So we could see some changes to the bill. If that happens, though, it needs to go back to the House. And the time is ticking here because Congress has a deadline of needing to act by July 19th, which is Friday.  All right, Melanie, we thank you for having on Top Story tonight. Up next, what might be the strangest bust you'll ever hear about. German officials foiling a plan to smuggle 1,500 tarantulas into the country. And you won't believe where they found them. Plus, pediatricians sounding the alarm over nicotine poisonings in children. The number of kids getting sick from nicotine pouches and other products skyrocketing. What parents need to know. That's coming up right here on Top Story.  We're back now with Top Story's Global Watch, and we begin in South Korea, where officials there are ordering airlines operating Boeing aircraft to inspect fuel cutoff switches. The mandate comes amid safety concerns raised about the airplane parts after the deadly Air India crash. Officials have now provided a timeline for inspections. In 2018, the FAA recommended inspections of the switches on Boeing models, including the 787.  Officials in Germany foiled a plan to smuggle 1,500, get this, young tarantulas into the country inside sponge cake. The eight-legged venomous creatures were discovered in chocolate cake boxes shipped from Vietnam to Cologne's airport. Many of the spiders did not survive the trip. Those that did were given to an expert handler. Criminal proceedings have been filed against the intended recipient.  All right, and France celebrating its largest national holiday, Bastille Day, with festivities nationwide. In Paris, at least 7,000 marchers in a parade along the Champs-Elysees with horseback riders and armored vehicles. A drone show, I should say, happening over the Eiffel Tower and fireworks in nearly every city. The holiday marks the day Parisians stormed the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, sparking, of course, the French Revolution.  At a Top Stories health check and an urgent new warning for parents, the number of babies and toddlers with illnesses related to nicotine products has skyrocketed. A new study from the Medical Journal of Pediatrics say more than 130,000 cases of nicotine poisoning in kids under the age of six were recorded from 2010 to 2023. Most of the cases attributed to contact with products like  nicotine pouches and vape e-liquids. For more on what you can do to protect your kids from exposure and sickness, let's bring in NBC News Medical Contributor, Dr. Natalie Azar. Natalie, so great to see you. I want to give this stat to our viewers because this is one of the reasons why we're doing it. The number of nicotine poisoning shot up almost by seven, it shot up 763% in kids in just three years. So how are these kids ending up sick from nicotine and is it those zinc pouches that have become so popular?  Yeah, well, I mean, I agree, Tom, that I think we've seen a significant rise in the popularity of a lot of different products in lieu of people smoking cigarettes, including these nicotine pouches, as well as vapes. And they're almost really ubiquitous.  I think, you know, children are uniquely susceptible to toxicity from these, Tom, given simply their size. The average amount of nicotine that is contained, let's say, in a pouch of Zin, is anywhere from about one and a half to 15 milligrams of nicotine. But as little as one to two milligrams can be toxic to a toddler, as opposed to really a much, much higher amount that adults can tolerate before they can experience toxicity.  But I guess the big question is, Dr. Azar, why are kids getting into them? Is there something that these nicotine products now look like that they didn't look like before?  So kids have always been susceptible to putting things in their mouths that they shouldn't. You know, it's not necessarily that they're flavored. You know, we talk about that a lot with vaping and with teens. But I think it's just, it's something small lying around the house. Children are going to put that in their mouths quite simply. That can suck on them. It's exactly the right size or the wrong size, you know, for exposure if you have little ones in the house, Tom.  Dr. Azar, if your child does suffer from nicotine poisoning, what are some of the symptoms and do you call 911? Should you rush your child to the ER?  Yeah, so in the first couple of minutes after exposure, Tom, some of the symptoms could include sweating, agitation, nausea, vomiting, a high heart rate. But after that, that's when it gets kind of critical, where children can experience a drop in blood pressure, a drop in their heart rate, and even coma. And so if you ever are suspicious about any kind of exposure or ingestion of nicotine with those early signs or symptoms that I mentioned, you need to call 911 immediately.  All right, Dr. Azar, always a pleasure to have you on Top Story. We thank you so much. We learned a lot here. When Top Story returns, some hope in the midst of heartache. The Texas camp that gave children with disabilities a place to belong nearly wiped out by the floods until an army of volunteers stepped in to help. Their story's coming up next.

Did you kill and murder Ethan Chapin, a human being? Yes.  Koberger recently pled guilty in a deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty and gave the parents the assurance he'll never be allowed to appeal. The Chapin spoke to NBC exclusively for the first time since that chilling confession. Was that your first time seeing Brian Koberger in person? Yes. What was that like? Honestly, I really didn't give it a thought, because it doesn't matter. It's done. It's just shocking, the wreckage that is that person.  Their focus now, remembering Ethan. His parents and triplet siblings, Maisie and Hunter, reflect on his life in a new Amazon Prime documentary, One Night in Idaho. Ethan was definitely like the leader. Like I would go to him and Hunter would go to him. We were raised very centered around family. So we were friends with everyone, but we were best friends with each other.  The family remembers their best friend by holding on to things he loved. Ethan's Jeep still parked in the garage. It was just so him. I mean, he even had the flag and the grill. In what ways do you feel Ethan's presence? Everywhere in this house.  I mean, he just could just blow into any room and had something funny to say.

So, are we all ready to go? All right. Okay, well, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday, July 13th, marked one year since the tragedy that struck my hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman nearly assassinated President Trump. Tragically, he took the life of Corey Competore and seriously wounded David Dutch and James Copenhaver.  Yesterday I returned to the Butler Farm Showgrounds where I was with the President a year ago. I met with the Comptatore family during a celebration of Corey's life. They are incredibly strong and I know all of us on stage continue to send our thoughts and prayers to them as we seek more answers about what actually happened that day. Now we're here today to highlight  new resolution H.R. 571, which formally recognized the events of 2014 and July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. The resolution also condemns the rise in political violence we have seen across our nation over the last year.  from the assassination attempts against President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania and West Palm Beach, Florida, to the attacks against Governor Josh Shapiro in April, and to the deadly attacks on the Minnesota state lawmakers just last month. Let's be clear. We must stand up together to oppose violence against our nation's leaders all across each party. And I want to thank my co-lead on the resolution,  RSC Chairman August Lugar from Texas. When we talk about this, though, we could have as many resolutions as we want to bring it forward. And I've heard person after person, politician after politician, get up and say, I am absolutely appalled by the violence is taking place in this country today. And we've got to stop using that type of language. And with 24 hours, they're out talking again about who should not be sitting in certain offices.  So it's one thing to have a resolution. It's one thing to be resolved the fact we're not going to keep talking like this. What I'm asking all our Congress, everybody that's in the Congress, everybody that's in elected office, please watch what you say. Don't start off saying we should never do this and then within 24 hours go out and make statements again that incite people. That's a false lead. It's a false premise. Our resolution is an attempt to get people to speak  the way they should speak. In America, the way we settle things is by votes. So it's my pleasure to be with all these people behind me today because they're all feeling the same way."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker commemorates the one-year anniversary of a tragic event in Butler, Pennsylvania where a gunman attacked a political rally, killing one person and injuring several others.

Y'all, this started under the Obama administration when they decided to illegally investigate conservative groups, when they were out there demonizing Republicans who just simply wanted to follow the Constitution and make our country better. Then you fast forward to the Biden administration, who, they put this on steroids and actually allowed the public to take part in this game.  Example, Summer of Love, where rioters were out there burning police stations, assaulting officers, taking over our cities, where they were advocating to defund the men and women in blue who protect us. And they didn't just encourage it, y'all, they promoted it. Hey, they even paid for their bail. The other thing I want to make a point is, and I think Representative Green hit the nail on the head, y'all, we got a morality problem in this country.  There's no value to the sanctity of life anymore. Socialist, woke politicians, they want to have people to look to the government for every answer they need. We don't look to the government. We're supposed to look towards God for our answers. What happened in Butler? That's an example. An example of the consequences of this Democrat rhetoric.

Congressman Lewis's parting words to us were published in the New York Times in an op-ed entitled, Together You Can Redeem the Soul of Our Nation.  It was a message of hope as he passed the baton as a drum major for justice to the next generation of Americans. His words are more necessary today than ever and need to be repeated. And for the next hour, you will hear members of the Congressional Black Caucus and other members who served with Congressman Lewis or inspired by him  using his words to talk about his legacy. I'd like to start with the beginning of his op-ed, which is poignantly relevant today. While my time here has now come to an end,  I want you to know that in the last days and hours of my life, you inspired me. You filled me with hope about the next chapter of the great American story when you used your power to make a difference in our society. Millions of people, motivated simply by human compassion, laid down the burdens of division  Around the country and around the world, you set aside race, class, age, language, and nationality to demand respect for human dignity. Mr. Speaker, we need that call, that clarion call, that demand  for respect for human dignity today more than ever before. We need the hope and inspiration that this drum major for justice saw in the next generation that would succeed him in the battle for the soul of our nation. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield two minutes to the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Yvette Clark.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Virginia for yielding, quote, our society is not unlike the children in that house, rocked again and again by the winds of one storm or another. The people of conscience never left the house, end quote.  In his memoir in 1998, Walking with the Wind, a memoir of the movement, the great Congressman John Lewis recounted a childhood memory of being caught in a terrifying storm with a group of children in his Aunt Soneva's small house in Pike County, Alabama, near the town of Troy.  As the storm tried to lift the house, John and the children held hands and worked together, using their unity as their strength to stabilize the home. This was, among things, a metaphor for how society, especially in moments of discord, upheaval, and conflict, requires people to come together, hold on, and stand firm against forces trying to tear it apart.  As it happens, the icon, Congressman Lewis's words, timeless words, speak directly to the unique moment we find ourselves in today. With the unprecedented assaults on our voting rights and the slow erosion of our constitutional democratic norms, the House most certainly is in danger.  voting rights, and has always been the CBC's North Star. And right now, the franchise, this tool, the foundation of our democracy, is under threat. At a time when our democracy is under constant siege by the Trump administration, we must do all we can to protect it.  As we speak, extremist Republicans at the local, state, and national levels are running the table with every tactic in their arsenal to disenfranchise Black and minority communities. To date, hundreds of bills to restrict voting access  have been introduced in states around the country with the aim of closing polling locations, curbing early voting, vote by mail, and imposing stricter voter ID requirements. These efforts are coordinated, they are well funded, and they are targeting our communities with laser-like precision. The question now is, what are we going to do to stop it?  For generations we have marched, fought, and even died for the right to vote. Congressman Lewis certainly knew this. It is a shame that partisan politics have brought us to the point that we cannot agree that access to the ballot box should be a right afforded to every American.  Congressman John Lewis is devoted every day of his life to fighting to make our country live up to its highest ideals, to the promise that all men, and may I add women, are created equal. From the Edmund Pettus Bridge to the halls of Congress, the boy from Troy never stopped making good trouble.  It is in that spirit that the CBC and House Democrats will always fight back against the voter suppression that plagues our country and impedes access to the ballot box, particularly in black communities. It is in that spirit that we will not stop until we pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore and modernize the protections of Voting Rights Advancement Act,  to prevent states from erecting new barriers to the ballot box. As our beloved John said, the people of conscience never left the house. With that, I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

Mr. Speaker, on this fifth anniversary of the passing of Congressman John Lewis, I rise to sound the alarm. Our democracy demands action now, the democracy that John Lewis fought for,  bled for, still remains under attack. And after the Supreme Court's Shelby County v. Holder decision, nearly 100 new laws surfaced. Closing polling places, cutting early voting, banning drop boxes, changing ID rules. And who's paying the price?  democracy. That's not a policy, Mr. Speaker, it's persecution. These restrictions aren't about protecting democracy. It is simply a modern poll tax in disguise, aimed to confuse, designed to suppress and discourage voters. Because when we vote, when we fight, we win at the ballot box.  I know this firsthand, and I know the importance of acting for our democracy. You see, I marched with Congressman John Lewis in Washington, in Selma, and in my hometown, Dayton, Ohio, to the Board of Elections to stand up  and to stand against voter suppression with a new generation of warriors in that fight. That's why we must pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and Freedom to Vote Act to end these discriminatory practices and make it easier, Mr. Speaker, for everyone to vote. Because our democracy is not a state, it's an act. And I yell back.

We followed his lead wherever he took us to make this statement.

Now it is your turn, he said, to let freedom ring. Mr. Speaker, John Lewis's lasting legacy represents both the progress of our nation and the promise of what our nation can become. He believed in a better tomorrow.  in a more perfect union, in one country, one destiny, he believed it in all of us. He had a deep faith in the goodness of people and he believed that everyone was worthy of respect. Again, I was honored to serve with him for more than 30 years and learn from him all that time and saw in this Congress how he taught us  through words and actions, what true moral leadership looks like.

He wrote the first 300 pages, 300 pages of the For the People Act, which was to end voter suppression. We all know of his leadership as being the title of the  John Lewis Voting Rights Act that is still not there. Today, as we witness attacks on civil rights, on democracy, on diversity, even on people's basic necessities, many Americans are looking for hope.

It is now my pleasure to yield to one of John Lewis's delegation mates, Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia.  I thank the Chairlady for yielding the time, and I thank the Congressional Black Caucus under the leadership of Yvette Clark for hosting this Special Order Hour to honor  John Lewis, who was a one-of-a-kind public servant. He served humanity as a youth and as an adult, and he served we, the people, before and during his many years in elected office on the local and federal levels of government. I had the honor and pleasure of serving closely with John Lewis during 14 of my 19 years here in Congress. And during those years, I learned so much from John Lewis. We all did.  And I continue to learn from the writings he left for posterity. The lessons Congressman Lewis imports in his book, Walking with the Wind, a memoir of the movement, today inspires us and provides us with direction on the way forward during this unprecedented or these unprecedented and deeply disturbing times in which we are living.  John tells the story about 15 children outside playing in his Aunt Savina's dirt yard. The sky began clouding over, the wind started picking up, lightning flashed, and suddenly the 15 children felt terrorized. John's Aunt Savina  Soneva was the only adult around, and as the sky blackened and the wind grew stronger, she herded those 15 children inside her small clapboard house. With 16 people squeezed into that house, it was surprisingly quiet as the wind howled, and the house built on cinder blocks began to shake. They were scared.  Even Aunt Seneva was scared, and then it got worse. Now the house was beginning to sway. The wood plank flooring beneath us began to bend, and then a corner of the room started lifting up. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. None of us could. This storm was actually pulling the house toward the sky with us inside. That was when Aunt Seneva told us to clap hands.  Line up and hold hands, she said, and we did as we were told. Then she had us walk as a group toward the corner of the room that was rising. From the kitchen to the front of the house we walked, the wind screaming inside, sheets of rain beating on the tin roof.  Then we walked back in the other direction as another end of the house began to lift. And so it went back and forth, 15 children walking with the wind, holding that trembling house down with the weight of our small bodies. The 15 children, Mr. Speaker, in that small house with a fierce storm upon it,  is the America that we see today. Those 15 children represent Black, White, Latino, Asian people. Among them are our LGBTQ brothers and sisters. They are Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. We are diverse. We are all equal. And we find ourselves included in the same house, America. And that house, or our country, is under assault.  More than half a century has passed since that day that John just spoke about, and it has struck me, he says, more than once over those many years that our society is not unlike the children in that house, rocked again and again by winds of one storm or another, the walls around us seeming at times as if they might fly apart.  But Mr. Speaker, the storm always passes, and the sun always comes out. As Aunt Soneva said, clasp hands, walk to the corner of the house that is moving, then move to the next corner and the next, and don't stop until the storm blows over. Thank you. I yield back.  Mr. Speaker, I now yield two minutes to Representative Terry Sewell, who has made sure that members of Congress follow the footsteps that John Lewis took, where he bled for our right not only to vote, but be here in this chamber. I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama. Mr. Speaker, never give up.  Never give in. Keep the faith and keep your eyes on the prize. Those were the words of John Lewis as he crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the last time before his passing in 2020. If I close my eyes, I can hear him say it. Never give up. Never give in. Keep the faith.  His body was frail and stricken with cancer, but his mind was sharp, and his charge to us was clear. No matter what challenges we face, we can never give up.  In these troubling times, I think of those words often. John would have a lot to say about what's going on these days. The attacks on our democracy, the erasing of our history, the efforts to make harder for people to vote. All battles have indeed become new again. But if there is one thing that John has taught us, it's that we must press on.  Just imagine where we would be if John Lewis and those foot soldiers had given up on Bloody Sunday. They were beaten, bruised. They were gassed and whipped. They had every reason to throw up their hands and surrender. But they didn't. They got back up and they tried again. And they marched on until victory was won.  So as we navigate this dark chapter of our history, let us be guided by their persistence and inspired by their determination. Let us pledge that we will introduce Congress after Congress after Congress, the John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, until victory is won.  We can be tired, we can be frustrated, we can be downright mad, but we can never give up. From the boy from Troy to the girl from Selma, in remembrance of John Lewis, let's keep the faith and let's keep our eyes on the prize.  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the representative from North Carolina, Alma Adams. I thank the lady from Virginia for yielding. When you see something that's not right,  Not fair, not just. You have a moral obligation to say something, to do something. Those were John Lewis's words. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the fifth anniversary of the late, great Congressman John Lewis's passing, a firebrand, a trailblazer, a mentor, and a leader whose outsized presence can still be felt throughout the halls of Congress.  Congressman Lewis taught us that we have a moral obligation to root out injustice wherever we find it, proudly, boldly, and unapologetically. And he believed that the soul of our nation hinged on everyday people dedicating themselves to the pursuit of justice and to honor his life and legacy. We must speak out about the injustices we face today.  The one big ugly bill that my Republican colleagues applauded and cheered in this very chamber earlier this month stands opposed to everything Congressman Lewis spent his life fighting for. It strips care away from the sick,  threatening Medicaid for more than a half million North Carolinians. And it takes food off the plates of the hungry, with 1.4 million North Carolinians, including 600,000 children, now at risk of losing their food assistance. It denies our children the right to a quality education, targeting our public schools and making it even harder for average Americans to afford higher education.  Make no mistake, this bill places the American dream further out of reach for nearly everyone who calls our country home and breaks the American promise. The one big ugly bill is a betrayal of our country and it's up to every single person in the United States, the ordinary people with extraordinary vision to join us  and standing against it. We must fight back the way John Lewis did, using our voice, our actions, and our communities to right wrongs and to protect those who are suffering from the injustices they face. This is the moral obligation that Congressman Lewis talked to us about.  And now is the time to speak up, to act up, and yes, cut up if we have to. But let's go make some good trouble. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back. I thank the lady for yielding. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to the representative from North Carolina, Ms. Bonnie Watson Coleman. Sorry, New Jersey. New Jersey."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1504.893, "text": " I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding me some time. Wherever community is interrupted by evil or hatred, by greed, by the lust for power, it is the moral responsibility of people of goodwill to respond. John Lewis wrote those words over 27 years ago. He was echoing calls for resistance to oppression passed down from our founding fathers, but it could very well have been said about today.  John was calling on all of us to fight for our communities. It was a call for solidarity. It was a call to reject the corporate influence that permeates our politics and puts profits over people. Today we're seeing the GOP pass bills that cut nutrition assistance to pay for corporate tax cuts.  Bills that cut funding to nursing homes to pay for billionaire vacation homes. Republican senators with Ivy League degrees working to eliminate college loans for poor students trying to work their way into the middle class.  It will take all of us to change this culture of greed and put people over politics.

Well, I want to thank my colleague, Representative McClellan from Virginia for leading this time here on the House floor. It's pretty difficult to believe that it's actually been five years that have passed since the loss of our dear friend and our colleague, Congressman John Lewis. At this delicate moment in our nation's history, we draw upon the wisdom of his words.  and look to his legacy for strength and guidance as we carry the torch that he lit for civil rights. In his last words to the American people, John wrote, and I quote, ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.  Voting and participating in the democratic process are key. Ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of a nation. Where else but America could one develop that sense of conviction? John Lewis knew it was true because he lived it every single day of his life.  the son of sharecroppers, who preached to chickens as a young boy when nobody else would listen, would go on to become known as the conscience of Congress, this body, a legislative body which once denied him his right to participate in American democracy. When John marched,  Americans were moved to act with him. When he spoke, people listened. And when he participated in sit-ins, including one in this very chamber, to confront the issue of gun violence in America,  He challenged each of us to join him in getting in that good and necessary trouble to raise the consciousness of the American public and lay down the heavy burdens of hate. Ordinary people with extraordinary vision. That's who John Lewis was. And it's who he calls on each of us to be.  especially in this day and in this hour. We must continue to honor his legacy with unshakable determination to fight for what is right and for what is just. Because I promise you, this is exactly what the American people deserve, and I yield.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is now my pleasure to yield to Congressman Lewis's successor, Representative Nakima Williams of Georgia's 5th. Thank you so much. Do not get lost in a sea of despair.  Be hopeful. Be optimistic. Ours is not the struggle of a day, a week, or even a month or a year. Ours is the struggle of a lifetime. When Congressman John Lewis spoke these words, he was reminding us that justice work is much longer than a moment. It's a commitment, a calling, a lifelong fight.  Sixty years after he put his body on the line for our freedom, our struggle continues. We're marching in our communities and fighting back in committee rooms. We do this to push back against cuts to Medicaid that will leave NICU babies without care. Cuts to SNAP that will take food out of the mouths of children and seniors. Cuts to education that will tell our students to dream smaller.  We bring our full selves to the struggle in many ways, through early mornings in community centers and late nights on the House floor, by standing up at the mic and showing up in the margins, through town halls and negotiating in the halls of Congress, through sitting in, standing firm, and speaking out. Getting into good trouble was never a one-size-fits-all call to action, and we honor the legacy of Congressman Lewis when we all find all ways to get in the way.  Y'all, this moment is not the last struggle that we will face, but we fight anyway. With hope, with intention, with determination to achieve the beloved community. This is the struggle of a lifetime. The struggle of our lifetime. With urgency and clarity and intention, we march on. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I now yield to the gentleman from Louisiana, Representative Troy Carter.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for yielding. The path I've been committed to extends beyond the issue of race alone and beyond class as well, and gender, and age, and every other distinction that tends to separate us. These words from Congressman John Lewis. These words from the late, great,  Congressman John Lewis reminds us that the struggle for justice isn't confined to just one issue, one identity, or one community. It's a path that winds through race, class, gender, age, ability, sexual orientation, and faith.

Congressman Lewis once said, ordinary people with extraordinary vision can redeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.  We need to get into good trouble now more than ever. It certainly feels like today we're in the struggle for the soul of America, a soul that desperately needs healing. In the fight to heal the soul of America in 1965, Congressman Lewis got into good trouble. The good trouble he found himself in, in Selma, nearly cost him his life. But from that good trouble came great progress.  the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Medicaid, Medicare, the Fair Housing Act. Monumental achievements made possible through many years of nonviolent struggle by ordinary people with an extraordinary vision. Sadly, 60 years later, it feels like we're going backwards.  Last time we were on this floor, House Republicans passed a bill to rip away health care for millions of Americans, to take food assistance away from families in need. For House Republicans and President Trump, making it harder for kids to eat so that some billionaires can pay less in taxes may count as progress. But America is better than that.  To move in the right direction again, we must fight back for what we believe in, to protect the vulnerable, to assist those in need.  to fight against discrimination. John Lewis serves as an inspiration for all of us during these unprecedented and difficult times for so many of our constituents. We must stay engaged, stay focused, and stay committed to the American ideals we cherish, the ideals Congressman John Lewis fought for both in this house and in Selma.

I never had the privilege of serving alongside Congressman Lewis, who's also my fraternity brother,  But five years after his passing, his faith, his words, his story, his work inform my work. I often recall his words, it's not about who wins. It's not even about who is right. It is about what is right. That never changes.  Regardless of if our districts are cobalt blue or ruby red, every single member of Congress took an oath to do right by our constituents and to fight for policies that not only help them get by, but help them get ahead.  However, Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues have just enacted the largest transfer of wealth from the working class to the top 1% in our nation's history, cutting essential programs and leaving many Americans poorer, sicker, and hungrier.  Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, they continue to turn a blind eye to our neighbors, friends, and family members who are being torn from our communities by this administration's militarized ICE. No matter who is in power, we should all agree that it is unacceptable for infants to go without formula.  for toddlers to attend school on empty bellies, and for children to be handcuffed and separated from their parents. It is wrong for children battling cancer to lose access to health care or to be deported to countries they have never known. Mr. Speaker, if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle cannot put politics aside to advocate for children, then who are they truly standing up for? I'll let you all figure that one out.  America is at a crossroads. Where we go from here as a nation depends on those courageous enough to stand for the most vulnerable among us, rather than selling us out to the highest bidder.

It is not even about who is right. It is about what is right. That never changes. May they find even a fraction of the courage that Congressman Lewis had and do right by their constituents.

I thank the gentlelady for yielding and I'm honored to speak today in tribute to the life and legacy of an iconic American patriot, John Robert Lewis, our friend and colleague who transitioned from labor to reward five years ago this week. John was and still is the conscience of this Congress. In his posthumous published op-ed, Together You Can Redeem the Soul of Our Nation, John Lewis wrote,  I just had to see and feel it for myself that after many years of silent witness, the truth is still marching on. Those words speak to us today as truth is no longer valued in our public dialogue. Lies are rampant from our public spaces in support of denying basic rights of voting, health, nutrition, opportunity, and humanity.  in official attempts to rewrite and whitewash our history. Lies to deny diversity, equity, and inclusion. Lies to remove African American and other cultural and racial groups from public spaces and our history books and museums. John told us we must study and learn the lessons of history because humanity has been involved in this soul-wrenching existential struggle for a very long time.  John wrote, the truth does not change. That is why the answers worked out long ago can help you find solutions to the challenges of our time. Truth does not change, he said. We must continue to use the truth of history to move us forward. Yes, the truth is still marching on.  Lowell said, truth forever on the scaffold, wrong forever on the throne, yet that scaffold sways the future and behind the dim unknown standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own. John gave his life  for the truth that all men and women are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is our duty to keep up his fight, to get into good trouble, to make that happen. I yield back. Thank you. I now yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey, Representative LaMonica McIver.  Thank you so much to the gentlewoman from Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a new voice, as a new face, as a new generation, but still living by the words, when you see something that is not right, you must say something, you must do something. Democracy is not a state, it is an act.  These words, those words, the words of the late John Lewis are as relevant now as they've ever been.  They ring true in a time when our democracy is threatened, in a time when politicians attempt to choose their voters instead of letting their voters choose them, in an effort to suppress the voices of the American people, and when the powerful reject accountability and oversight and come after those who stand up against cruelty.  Rep. John Lewis believed that our democracy is precious and sacred. He believed that showing up and taking action has the power to create a more perfect union. He was right.  His passion for peace, justice, and the true belief in America inspired generations. And today, we stand on his shoulders as we continue to fight to protect our democracy on so many fronts, and as we defend that sacred right at the heart of it. Our voice, our vote.  I am proud to stand beside my colleagues in this work and the battle for the soul of our democracy. I will continue. Yes, Mr. Speaker, I will continue to allow the spirit of John Lewis to encourage me to act and to get into some good trouble and necessary trouble to redeem the soul of America. With that, I yield back.  I now yield to the gentleman from Alabama, Representative Shamari Figures. Thank you. In his final op-ed, Congressman Lewis said, you must study and learn the lessons of history because humanity has been involved in this soul-wrenching existential struggle for a very long time. Now, some may take those as just wise words from a civil rights icon,  But for me, I take those words, I take that statement as a personal charge because I now have the privilege, I have the blessing of representing not only the birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement in Montgomery, Alabama, but also the birthplace of John Lewis, the man who often referred to himself as the boy from Troy, which is a small town in Pike County, Alabama, which is now in District 2.  a district, I might add, that exists in its current format today because of the Voting Rights Act, the same very Voting Rights Act that John Lewis risked his life to see enacted. But those words in that final abed, to me, they are a charge to not forget where we have come from or what we have been through as a nation, but also a charge to be vigilant.  and to commit to ensuring that we never go back to certain days in this country's past. But that charge is becoming increasingly more important by the day. It seems that every day there's another effort to set us back to times we thought we were beyond as a nation. From watching the current administration walk back school desegregation, consent decrees, to the closing of civil rights offices across the federal government, to straight on attacks to efforts  to ensure that the playing field is balanced for everybody, regardless of what you look like. You know, it seems to me that we are forgetting where we came from as a nation, forgetting the times where people who look like me did not have the opportunity or the privilege to live in the same America as people who don't look like me. And these are not just efforts by this current administration to overtly roll back equal protections and access, but even in this very body,  But just recently, we passed legislation that imposes student loan borrowing caps on Americans who want to be doctors or lawyers. And those caps are less than the average cost of those degrees. Now, to some people, they may say, well, that's just race neutral. Well, those lessons of history that John Lewis was speaking of, they teach us a different lesson.  They teach us that in practice, what that means is fewer black people will be able to become lawyers. Fewer black people will be able to become doctors. That means fewer opportunities. That means fewer black parents can tell their kids that they can literally be anything they want to when they grow up. They must now caveat that by saying, if we can afford it, you can be a doctor. If our credit is good enough, you may be able to be a lawyer.  But that same history, that same history that clarifies what those recent actions mean, that same history tells us that no matter how dark the days may be now, no matter how dark the motives or the efforts are, no matter how dark the outcomes may be, that those spaces can never be as dark as they once were because the light of progress made  hangs forever in those spaces. The light of John Lewis hangs forever in those spaces. And so this is not a moment of complacency. We cannot afford to be complacent in this moment. We must aggressively, aggressively continue the fight as my colleagues have so eloquently laid out here tonight. We must continue the fight for justice, learning from our past and building upon the legacy of John Lewis and others, which demands that in moments like this,  We stand firm, we keep the faith, and we continue the struggle. I yield back. Ms. Speaker, I now yield to the representative from California's 12th District, Latifah Simon. Good evening, Mr. Speaker. I rise today  in honor of the late Congressman John Robert Lewis on the fifth anniversary of his passing. Congressman Lewis said in a beautiful quote, children holding hands, walking with the wind. This is America to me, the endless struggle to respond with decency, with dignity, and the sense of brotherhood.  We are so thankful for the legacy, the long-living, forever legacy of Congressman Lewis. Before he took the oath here in this room, many of us studied his legacy as a young activist and organizer. Depth with peace and clarity, he held hands with others and walked across the bridge in Selma to meet  What we know then was a violent mob who them themselves swore to decency.  They beat those young people that day, young people who rose up and decided that they too belonged to a democracy that they were born into, but never saw it. Their mothers never saw it. Their fathers never saw it. These young people took the mantle of peace and shone a mirror, a mirror of hatred, a mirror of segregation, of degradation. And they walked away harmed.  But with more clarity, Mr. Lewis was one of the leaders that day. Those who studied the theology of freedom that is so deeply embedded in all of our faith traditions.  know that the actions of Mr. Lewis on that bridge, on the streets, on this floor will forever live. And I want to go back before I end to that quote, children holding hands, walking with the wind. Those children, America's children, need us now more than ever.  Children will go back to school in six weeks, and because of what has been done on this hill, this week they will not have school lunches. We will diminish the Department of Education. The Office of Civil Rights within the Department of Education was responsible for making sure that those children, disabled children, children who had been pushed to the side, had national standards so that they too could be centered in the classroom with dignity and support.  We are tearing those winds apart. As children go hungry, as they are pushed to the side in their classrooms, as we continue to pay teachers less than what they are worth, I ask folks to do what we've learned from our dear mentor, John Lewis. Shine the light with peace and dignity upon those  who put forth evil, who strike down the widow, who take food from the poor, who take the word of our God out of context, who feed the wealthy while starving the homeless. Mr. Lewis, we will forever walk in your path.  for justice, for liberty, and for the sake of our children who need and deserve the winds at their back. And I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

Mr. Speaker, one of my biggest regrets is that I did not get to serve with Congressman Lewis, but I did get to meet him. He came to Richmond about a year, a year and a half before he passed, for the renaming of Arthur Ashe Boulevard.  I had the opportunity to sit with him at lunch and ride with him to an exhibit at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in a former Confederate chapel on land that was once a Confederate veteran's home. Walking into that chapel, knowing the history that occurred there,  and watching John Lewis sit and listen for the first time to the speech he gave during the Clinton impeachment. And he had tears streaming down his eyes. And the quote that sticks with me is when he asked in his booming voice, is this good for America?  If it's good for the American people, if it's good for the institution. And that, Mr. Speaker, is the question I ask myself every day in this office. John Lewis understood, just as Dr. King did, he wasn't going to reach the promised land of that more perfect union, but he fought for it.  And in his final words to us, he said, though I may not be there with you, I urge you to answer the highest calling of your heart and stand up for what you truly believe. If in my life I have done all that I can demonstrate that the way of peace, the way of love and nonviolence is the more excellent way, now it is your turn to let freedom ring. When historians pick up their pens and write the story of the 21st century, let them say that it was your generation  who laid down the heavy burdens of hate at last, and that peace finally triumphed over violence, aggression, and war. And so I say to you, walk with the wind, brothers and sisters, and let the spirit of peace and the power of everlasting love be your guide.  John Lewis handed us the baton.

Thank you, Madam President. Two weeks ago, Republicans passed one of the most unpopular bills in the history of the country. One of the most unpopular bills in the history of the country. And now that it's law, we don't have to imagine anymore what might happen.  We know for sure what's going to happen to tens of millions of people all across the country. I want to focus on five things that are going to happen. Five things that are going to happen because we no longer have to talk about a House version and a Senate version or what the President says he wants or what someone says they're going to, you know, if I don't get this, I'm going to vote no. Now we have a law. We have public law, federal law. First thing that's going to happen,  17 million Americans, including 9 million people on Medicaid, will lose health care coverage in about 18 months' time.  To keep their coverage, people will have to complete hours and hours of paperwork just to prove that they're working. That's in spite of the fact that the number of non-disabled adults on Medicaid who don't work is very low, about 8%. So how do these work requirements actually function? Well, in Arkansas, which is one of the two states that tried this and then pulled it back because it was a failure,  The reporting portal was only open during the day and closed between the hours of 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. So let's say you work long hours as a truck driver. If you're trying to log on at night to fill out your forms, you are out of luck. Or let's say...  Something unfortunate happens to you. Let's say you get in a car accident or have a bad case of the flu. Maybe you're not hospitalized, but you are incapacitated, at least temporarily. If you miss the reporting window, you might lose the coverage. And what's preposterous about these Medicaid work requirements is in order to establish that you're either working or seeking work, you have to fill out a form. If you get sick and are bedridden and can't fill out the form, they say, don't worry.  There's an exception for a situation like that. Guess how you apply for the exception? By filling out another form. There are only a couple of people on, a couple of million people on Medicaid who even fit the description of someone who's non-disabled and on Medicaid, and yet the actual official projections, which is to say the way they save the money is they're projecting many, many millions of people are going to get kicked off of Medicaid even though they're eligible.  And I know I'm a Democrat and I wanted this bill to fail and I want to tell you why this is a failure of a bill, but that's literally in their projections. Without those projections, they don't have enough revenue for the biggest tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the history of the planet. Number two, hundreds of rural hospitals and nursing homes will close without enough funding to continue operating.  More people are going to get sick because of this law, but we're going to have fewer hospitals and doctors to take care of them.  Why? Because Medicaid is a big revenue stream for really all hospitals, but especially rural hospitals. It can be up to about half of what they call the payer mix. What is a payer mix? It's just, you might get paid by private insurance 30%, you might get paid by Medicaid 45%, you might have a little VA, you might have a little private pay, adds up to 100%. So as you look at your revenue picture, 40, 50, sometimes even more percent of that money comes from Medicaid.  If there's a huge $1 trillion nationwide reduction in Medicaid money, that money is reduced money for rural hospitals. And rural hospitals will definitely close. Not all of them, but many of them. So even if you're not on Medicaid, if you live in a place where there's a rural hospital, and that's the flagship hospital for a small town,  That might not be available to you. You might have to drive two or three hours for care, even emergency care. Number three, starting next year, tens of millions of people are going to pay hundreds of dollars a month more for health insurance. And this one I think we should linger on because now that the fight over Obamacare is sort of in the rear view mirror,  People just think they get onto the ACA portal, they sign up for their health care, and they pay what they pay, right? Like, oh, I want a family plan, I want this level of deductible, and then it spits out how much you're going to pay every month. What tens of millions of people don't actually know is those rates on the exchange are subsidized.  And without those subsidies, we're going to go back to the bad old days, pre-Obamacare, when people would pay absurd amounts of money for their healthcare insurance, even if they're employed, even if they do have insurance. And what is, I think, underrated, both politically and on policy, is all of those rates get set in the next couple of months.  Because in order to start paying and in order to start enrolling, you've got to notify people, hey, your thing that was $289 a month, now it's $789 a month. And so sometime in the fall, it depends on the state.  October, November, some people in December are going to get a letter saying, if you want to stay on the same health care plan, here's your new price. And those new prices are going to be astronomical. Now, we do have a disagreement between the parties. I think there are a lot of people who just don't like  public subsidy of healthcare insurance premiums. I'm sure the presiding officer has her reservations about that kind of thing. It is about the size and the scope of government, but there is a factual aspect to this, which is whatever one's governing philosophy is, whatever one thought about the Affordable Care Act,  The plain fact of the matter is people are going to get letters from their insurance carriers with astronomical increases that they will not be able to pay. Number four, five million people are either going to lose some or all of their nutritional assistance starting next year. You know, this trope is like almost as old as I am.  like some lazy person on food stamps, just like collecting food stamps, loving that life, going to the store, buying fancy stuff. It's $6 a day. The average nutritional assistance amount per person per day is $6.  We have actually, I don't know if you know this, but we have subsidized food in the United States Senate. Not because the government's paying for it, but because all the restaurants that operate here don't have to pay lease rent. So it's a little bit cheaper than you would normally get. I can't get anything for six bucks downstairs in the Dirksen cafeteria. Not that would feed me. Six dollars a day is the average amount. And what the Republicans decided to do is to generate savings  is to find savings, to cut nutritional assistance. Why? Because they needed to pay for the biggest tax cut in American history for the wealthiest people and corporations that have ever existed. It would be one thing if people were getting $75 a day for food. It would be one thing if they were getting $25 a day for food. But they're getting $6. And 5 million people  will now have an enormously difficult time trying to figure out just how to survive the day. And I mean that quite literally, survive the day. Find the calories within your $6 or $8 or $12 budget. Finally, people are going to pay hundreds of dollars more per year on electricity because this bill throttles the cheapest and most abundant form of energy in wind and solar.  And this is where you've got to stay with me for a moment. I'm very passionate about climate action. I think it is a planetary emergency. I think it is a moral obligation that we take care of our planet so it can sustain us for generations to come. But even if you don't care about that, the only energy that is ready to come online right now  is solar energy, some wind energy, but mostly solar energy. Why? Because nuclear, frankly, takes at least 10 years to permit and site. And of course, anytime anyone wants to do any nuclear power generation, everybody in whatever neighborhood or state or county that is tries to stop it. And so you don't just have regulatory risk, you have project risk. 10 years is an optimistic scenario. I'm a big believer in nuclear energy.  But 10 years is the most realistic scenario to get a bunch of nuclear energy online. Likewise, geothermal, maybe five to eight years in the most optimistic scenario. Again, I love geothermal energy. I think it's an untapped resource across the United States of America. We have about a six-year gap before any of those other technologies are ready. And so a lot of fossil advocates go, well, why don't we do more gas?  There is a backlog of combined cycle gas turbines. And that can't just be fixed by saying, I will take more. Everybody wants more. There is a backlog. You cannot get gas generation online in the next five years. So what does that mean? It means over the next five years, solar is the stuff that is like instantly pluggable into the grid, super cheap, not terribly controversial, except for in this chamber.  and ready to power the AI revolution and whatever other load needs we have. But this bill kind of punitively, kind of ideologically decides, no, we're not for all of the above. You know that thing we said about whatever's cheap and plentiful and available every time we were trying to prevent clean energy from coming on the grid? Remember that thing we used to say? Now, really what we meant is we quite hate solar energy particularly. We hate solar energy.  Again, I think that's preposterous from a planetary standpoint. But even if there were no planetary crisis, this is the energy that is available to us. And we are about to face energy shortages. The reason, for instance, Texas of all places has not had blackouts and brownouts is because solar can absorb when the sun is high and it is 108 degrees and everybody's pumping their air conditioner, that also happens to be  the point in time, the point of the day, when all the solar farms are running at full capacity, and they can power the grid. And so solar energy isn't something from 17 years ago where you say, you know, sometimes the sun's shining, and sometimes it's not, and it's intermittent, and the batteries aren't there. All of that is in the rear view mirror. All the technical issues, not all of them, 90% of the technical issues related to solar energy have been resolved. And that's the scariest thing for the fossil energy people.  You know why? Because they can't argue that this isn't economically smarter. They just have to argue that it's like woke or something, like woke electrons. Who cares where the electrons come from? If they are cheap and plentiful, we should all be for them. And so this bill is going to create shortages, which will drive up prices and, in some places, reduce power quality. What does power quality mean? It means we're going to have blackouts and brownouts across the country.  So to do any of these things in a bill would be bad. But to do all of it, all of it, in order to pay for the biggest wealth transfer from the poor to the rich in history is morally and economically bankrupt. Nobody asked for any of this. Trump voters were not demanding any of this. Nobody was asking to lose their health care and not be able to feed their kids or pay more to keep the lights on at home.  But they raced to do it anyway, knowing full well how devastating it would be for the country and for their own home states. One final point. We are not going to stop talking about this.  We are going to talk about this until it is repealed. We're going to talk about this when the rates go up for your electricity. We're going to talk about this when kids are thrown off their nutritional assistance. We're going to talk about this when rural hospitals close. We are going to talk about this when your insurance coverage rates go up. We are not going to stop talking about this because this document, which was enacted into law,  is a perfect encapsulation of the difference between the political parties. My party is flawed, obviously. My party is flawed. But I've never seen my party propose a bill that transferred so much money from the poor to the rich.  And I've never seen my party propose a bill that raises the price of electricity, that raises the price of food, and raises the price of health care. And so we're going to talk about this today, tomorrow, for the next 18 months, and until this thing is repealed from the federal law books. I yield the floor."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": null, "SPEAKER_01": null, "SPEAKER_02": null, "SPEAKER_03": null, "SPEAKER_04": null, "SPEAKER_04 (Trump)": null, "SPEAKER_05": null, "SPEAKER_06": null, "SPEAKER_07": null, "Sam Schweppe": null, "Scarlett Fu": null, "Secretary of State Marco Rubio": null, "Selena Zito": null, "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Senator Chuck Grassley": null, "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer": null, "Senator Patty Murray": null, "Senator Susan Collins": null, "Stephen A.

So a couple years back, we allocated federal funds to help them build a new health clinic and upgrade their sewers. The health clinics and sewers didn't used to be controversial.  But then out of nowhere, the Trump administration canceled the grant for Thomas Fitts. Y'all know why? First, because the project had the word justice in it. And justice is now a forbidden word in Washington.  And second, because a tiny amount of the grant was for electric lawnmowers to maintain the new facilities. And electric vehicles, which were supposed to be Georgia's economic future, are now considered woke. So no more health clinic, no more sewer upgrades for Thomasville.

Aren't you proud about what the U.S. Coast Guard just did in Texas to help those individuals?  Texas just went through an incredible tragedy with the flooding event that happened and is still looking for their loved ones and for children and have been absolutely devastated. And the individuals who showed up there from the Coast Guard, from Border Patrol, those individuals from the BORTAC teams, from FEMA that showed up immediately and supported that state in its response to its individuals, I'm so proud of them because for the very first time, we acted in a way that disaster response should.  You know, the way statute lays out is that every emergency that happens in this country should be locally executed. That means the people that are closest to that emergency need to be the ones making the decisions to respond to people. It should be state-managed, which means the state makes the decisions on how they're going to universally handle this disaster. And the federal government, our role should be to support. We should be there to support. We shouldn't be making the decisions  We should be sending the support that is necessary to get that state through that situation and that's exactly how we implemented it in Texas and are continuing to do so to support Texas as it gets through this. And at the exact same time New Mexico was flooding, North Carolina had  some flooding events going on, and we continue to stand on watch to make sure that we're there to support people across this country. Regardless if you're Republican, Democrat, independent, if you love freedom and if you love this country, we are going to be there for you to help support you and get you through the most challenging days of your lives. Now, I'm here tonight, and I'm not going to talk much longer. I guess it says I have 19 minutes. I'm not going to talk that long.  But what I do want to talk to you about is that you guys are the future. People will tell you throughout life that there are things that will determine what you're going to be. They will tell you that the family that you're raised in, or the city that you're in, or the community is, is going to impact your future. I would disagree with that. People will tell you many times that your education will determine who you're going to be and what you will be. It'll open up doors for you and create new opportunities. I would say that I disagree with that.  Our Department of Homeland Security interacts with all of those areas. It interacts with even the jobs that you're going to have. The one thing I want to remind all of you here today, and one of the important reasons why I think that you should recognize that you are here, is because what still makes the world move, what still will determine your success in life, is relationships, is the people that you meet, the people that you spend time with, the people that you talk to,  I would encourage you to continue to stay involved, to go out there and to come to conferences like this, meet people, go shake hands. You never know when the next person that you meet may be your next mentor that will give you the greatest advice that turned your life around, that changed everything for you.  The next person you meet may be the person that gives you a reference for your next internship, or your first job position that you get, or maybe the scholarship that you need to get the degree that you want. Maybe you will meet somebody when you show up for an opportunity when that door is open that will be your next business partner. Don't leave this conference without recognizing that the most valuable thing that you gained here was the relationships that you built, the people that you talked to, and the people that you were with.  I've got a team around me and staff with me that every single day help me do the job that I do.

And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent.  but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defence industrial production. So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you that at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, they all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more.  So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning, as Pete Hecht said, at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will be on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them. So I really want to thank you for that. And it means the European is paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that.

This all because Joe and Kamala and Mayorkas, they all lied to us for four years. They said the border was closed, but they allowed millions and millions of unvetted illegal immigrants from over 200 countries  including countries with terror ties, into our country. The task ahead is monumental. The good news is a lot of progress is being made, but it's going to be hard. Thousands of criminal, illegal aliens are now taken into ICE custody every week. There was a raid at a California marijuana farm that resulted in the arrest of more than 300 illegal immigrants. Among those detained were 10 exploited minors working at the marijuana farm.  What do we call that? Oh, that's right, child abuse, alongside a notorious sex predator from Mexico. And now the left, they are upped in arms, not because of that, not because Joe Biden allowed violent predators to cross into our country unvetted and then lost track of literally  to hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors, but because ICE is now detaining criminals and rescuing these children, by the way. And as a big thank you, Democrats are attacking the people that are protecting the kids, and not just with words. Look at what's going on, according to the DHS.  Assaults on federal officials are up a whopping 700 percent. A lot of these agents are being set up. These agents get attacked now almost every single day. It is underreported. Let's look at this timeline. July 2nd, a man repeatedly ramming an ICE vehicle with his car in California. July 4th, a group of far-left extremists attacking an ICE detention facility in Texas. In that case, shooting a local law enforcement officer in the process.  July 7, a gunman opening fire at the entrance of the United States Border Patrol annex in Texas. July 8, mass rioters assaulting ICE agents at a San Francisco courthouse. July 10, scores of rioters attacking ICE agents that  farm, at that marijuana farm in California. One even pulled a weapon and fired it in the direction of law enforcement on July 11th. More violence against federal officials, this time in Portland, Oregon. And tonight, a California state professor is now facing federal charges after throwing a tear gas canister at law enforcement. And we could pretty much go on for the rest of the hour. On and on and on. Make no mistake.  There is a huge violence problem on the left. But instead of supporting federal officials, instead of recognizing the Constitution, which, of course, gives the authority and jurisdiction to the feds in this particular case\u2014it's called the Supremacy Clause\u2014Democrats, they only add fuel to the fire. They are more interested in the so-called rights of illegals than they are about the safety and security of Americans in small towns.  and big cities, and they have been vilifying ICE around every turn. And as a result, the threats of violence get larger and larger, on top of doxing ICE agents and their families. And instead of calling on cooler heads to prevail, the Party of Peace, even Obama is telling his fellow Democrats to, quote, toughen up, have some courage. Not that he had any. But none of this is going to stop the Trump administration from doing their job, protecting the country. These deportations will continue.  Hey, Sean Hannity here.

For working and middle class families, that means more money directly into the pockets of every single American watching your show tonight.

That man is working around the clock. He hardly ever sleeps. He's constantly thinking about not just the problems in our country here, but around this world and how to solve them. And look at what he's done on the world stage with bringing peace to the Middle East,  withdrawing Russia and Ukraine to actually talk directly for the first time in this war in years. We see what's happening with the hostages coming out of Gaza, and he's going to keep pushing until every last hostage is out.

Joe Biden begrudgingly gave Ukraine defensive weapons.  There was never an attempt to actually win. The only reason that Russia invaded Ukraine was because of Joe Biden's feckless leadership. When Joe Biden took us out of Afghanistan so horribly, Putin saw that as a green light.

Number one, I want to go back to my previous point, and then I'll get to it. I don't think that we can overstate how significant today was. This idea that America has always had to foot the bill for everybody else's issues, right? Europe needs to step up for its own national defenses. The same thing that he did in NATO he did today, which is show us a new way, a way that America can actually help its allies, but at the same time, not have to foot the bill for everybody's backyard issue. That's what he showed us today. To your point,  Look, all that one needs to do is read Trump's books, The Art of the Deal, The Art of the Comeback. Look at how he has dealt and negotiated his entire life. He talks very openly about this. You can't get a deal if you kick somebody in the face. You can't get a deal if you malign them. He has tried to talk to Putin to say, hey, look,  I want to end the war. He's the only one who for 40 years actually had peace, right? He understands that you can't have the same thing happen over and over again as Joe Biden did and expect a different outcome. So he tried to do what he could with Putin to have a conversation. He made it clear today. Talk is done. I'm going to take action. But I give him credit for trying to find a new and better way to achieve peace and not have the American taxpayer continue to foot the bill every single time Europe has a problem.  You give him credit, and I hear you. There's also questions, Sean, as you know, with the base and what the president is doing or is not doing. I'll give you a couple highlights here. Marjorie Taylor Greene, quote, we do not want to give or sell weapons to Ukraine or be involved in any foreign wars or continue the never-ending flow of foreign aid, end quote. And then this also comes as parts of the right are not happy  with how jeffrey epstein and and that case has been handled here was laura trump earlier today and i'll get your reaction i believe that there will probably be more coming on this and i believe anything that they are people to release that doesn't you know damage any witnesses or anyone underage or anything like that uh... i really don't probably try to get out sooner rather than later to everybody out there is all worked up about it there's no still a great plot to try and keep this information away that i'm aware of  What damage has been done with the base, Sean? Well, it's to be seen. But I think the problem that they face is that they handed out, the Attorney General handed out a series of binders earlier that purported to show that there was, and then said, coming soon, there's going to be more. And so they set a level of expectations that people rightly thought would be met, and they didn't.  So I get it, and I think Laura Trump is articulating probably where they are right now, which is to figure out how do we explain this. We set the bar. The Attorney General said that there was more information. And I think people on the right, who has expected transparency, were led to believe that there'd be more to the situation. I think Laura's right. They're probably trying to figure out what can we release to show what's there. But look, at the end of the day, as somebody who has known Donald Trump for 10 years, been there at the beginning,  What he is doing on the MAHA front, on tax cuts, on the big beautiful bill, on foreign policy, he is enacting not just one or two signature things, but entirely pushing the movement forward and getting things done in each of the respective areas. I give him a lot of credit. I think we hold him to a high standard because we've expected so much of Donald Trump. But we've got to remember that this is a guy who's not giving us excuses, but results.  I do think it's fair to point out that the first six months and what's happened, you can say has been successful for the president, Sean. And in the last week, there have been a lot of questions from those who support him louder than anyone else who are wondering.  what's going on here in this moment."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 856.91, "text": "And he has to address it."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 857.651, "text": "But again, can I have one quick point?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 858.913, "text": "Sure, real quick, and then I got to run."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 859.894, "text": "One last thing.

With me now, the California Democratic Congressman Ami Bera, member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, once again with us tonight here on the Hill. Thanks for being with us. I hear the DHS Secretary say that these Alligator Alcatraz, the facility there, is at the highest levels of standards there. If that's the case, Congressman, if you take them at their word, at face value, would you be for more of those going forward?  Well, what I'd say is if that is the case, they ought to invite you in there, Blake, to take a look and see what the high standards are. I look forward to talking to my colleagues from Florida, getting a sense of what they saw when they were in there. My gut sense is that these are substandard conditions, that folks are just herded into really unsanitary conditions. Again, I haven't seen it for my own eyes, but I do want to talk to my colleagues and get a sense here.  You know, we saw the raids there in your home state in California last week. We carried those images live here on the Hill and on NewsNation. The government now says 350-plus undocumented workers, including 14 children, four people were picked up who had been convicted at one point in time of kidnapping, rape, or burglary. California safer now?  You know, I think California has always been pretty safe. And most crime statistics over the last four or five years are way down. So I think California is pretty safe. If he wants to go after criminals, folks with warrants and so forth, that's fine. I think he's going to find a lot of support amongst Democrats. But he's going after kids. He's going after farm workers, other folks, folks that have been in our communities for a long time. I think that's where he's going to lose public support. And if you look at those poll numbers, he is starting to lose some of that support.  So what's the balance here? Because I just read off what the government says occurred there in part last week. And I think anybody would acknowledge, at least when it comes to those kids and violent criminals, that you need to step in.  Yeah, I mean, so for violent criminals, that's fine. Again, he's not going to see any pushback. What we're starting to hear is that they're picking up families, they're approaching folks that look like they might have brown skin and so forth, they might have an accent.  I don't think that's what the public voted for. You know, you're hearing the farm workers afraid to go pick the crops. You're having construction workers being afraid to go to work. Those guys are not criminals. Those men and women are here helping support our economy. I think we ought to have an honest conversation about where we want to go with immigration at this point. You always have one. It's why I enjoy talking to you and having you on the show. Ami Barrett, Democrat there from California. We'll talk to you again soon.  Great. Thanks, Blake. Be well. You as well. Programming note, by the way, for this Wednesday, it is a big day for NewsNation and our partners over at The Hill. The first ever Hill Nation Summit featuring some of the most influential folks in this town and beyond, both sides of the aisle. Democrats and Republicans, you know it's what we do. And by the way, would you look at that? I will be interviewing Christy Noem.  DHS Secretary herself. My conversation with Kristi Noem, Wednesday afternoon. We'll play some of that for you here on The Hill, Wednesday evening, 6 o'clock Eastern, right here on News Nation. Still much more ahead tonight here on The Hill. Minerals, magnets, the military. China has been making calculated moves to bolster itself as a global superpower, but now the U.S. is fighting back and in a way,  that maybe you haven't thought of before. All the conversations about what's going on in the air, on the ground, and at sea. What about underground? I'll explain, other side of the break.  Welcome back here to The Hill on NewsNation. The threat from China is growing, and now America's top competitor is aggressively inserting itself, its navy rather, in the Pacific. Today's Wall Street Journal, for example, with this headline, how China's military is flexing its power in the Pacific. The Journal reports the U.S. is, quote, sounding the alarm as China ventures even closer to the shores of Western allies. It comes as the U.S. is aggressively trying to counter China's dominance below the ground.  The Defense Department announcing a first of its kind. We've never seen this before. A public-private partnership with MP Materials, a company that operated the only rare-earth mine in the United States until recently. And just on Friday in Wyoming, a ribbon-cutting ceremony with the Energy Secretary Christopher Wright for the second rare-earth mine in the U.S., the first one to open in 70 years.  that ribbon cutting with Christopher Wright out there. You can see some of the video from it. Scroll forward here a little bit if we can, because I want to show you what the problem is and the issue is. China mines almost 70 percent of the world's rare earth minerals, while the U.S., way behind at 12 percent. China also has about half  of the world's known reserves. The U.S. well back in seventh place. China showing no signs of slowing down either, doubling down on its exploration efforts. Here's a headline from the South China Morning Post reporting that China just discovered an additional 38 rare earth sites this year alone.  They also have a chokehold on the global supply chain. Now, in June, its rare earth exports surged to the highest level since 2009, an issue that the House will address directly in a hearing tomorrow. Now, the President stressed the importance of rare earth minerals, even leveraging mineral rights in peace talks all around the globe, particularly with Ukraine and the Congo."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 28, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1371.496, "text": " We're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earth and other things. We're getting for the United States a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 29, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1384.388, "text": " Now, U.S. Rare Earth is developing a manufacturing facility in Oklahoma as part of an effort to help make that state a leader in the production of rare earth magnets. With me now here on the Hill, Josh Ballard is the CEO of that company, USA Rare Earth. Thanks for being in. Nice to see you. Appreciate having me. So this story all of a sudden got really big because of the renewed trade war between the U.S. and China, and China basically is trying to put a hold on those rare earth magnets. What are they? Why are they so important? Yeah.  So rare-earth magnets, you have to imagine them as they're the technology that enables the electrification of the economy. So everywhere where you think about electricity being translated into motion, that's where these magnets are used. TVs are the obvious example, they can be used in drones, they can be used all through a car, cell phones, speakers, they're throughout the economy. Okay, so it's this phone, it's that camera, all this stuff here. Underpins modern technology.  How big of an issue is this? Because I just ripped off some of the stats there. China has 70% of the rare earth supplies. That's right. 70% of the rare earth supplies, over 90% of the processing, over 90% of the metal making, over 90% of the magnet production. And importantly, there's key rare earths that was on the China control list about two months ago that they control over 98% of, which are key for defense and some of the higher performance magnets that we need in these technologies.  What can we do about it? Like, is this solvable? This is the United States. We can solve anything, right? Is this one of those things? It's absolutely solvable. How? Of course we can. So there's two sides to it. I'm going to start from the easier, magnets and metal making. We can surge that here in the United States. We gave it up over the last four decades. We can certainly bring it back. We need some support from the government to lift up this entire industry. But of course, we can surge it and build it fairly quickly. The deposits, however, that's a harder nut to crack. This stuff is very hard to get out of the rock. It's not like digging coal and just taking it out and using it.  It's in the parts per millions within the rock. It takes a lot of science. It's going to take many years to do it. So you name check the government there. You're in town. Obviously, I presume there might be some sort of connection there. What can the government actually do? Because there's a real question here, like we saw the MP Materials deal, of if the government should be involved with a private American company. Yeah.  You also could make the argument that this is something that we have to win or we have to catch up on. That's right. We have to win it. We have to catch up. And the government's got to be super creative. We did it in 2008 when the auto manufacturing was suffering during the crisis. So that was a crisis. That's right. And this is a crisis. You believe this to be a crisis. Why?  These underpin our ability to create new defense technologies, right? They underpin a lot of modern technology today, and it's getting cut off. Ford was just saying just, what, a week or two ago that they were going to have to shut down production lines because they didn't have what? Magnets. And this is happening throughout. We have customers calling us every day, worried about their own magnet supply. So this could shut down specific industries. So it's a small industry in itself, a few billion, but it enables trillions of dollars of the economy.  So we already saw one company get into business with the government. Are you guys planning to do that? Do you want government investment in your company? We are looking for the government to support to build this industry. Absolutely. We need a moat from China. China gets a lot of subsidization, a lot of money from the government, tax kickbacks, and so forth. It's not a competitive environment that we can compete against, but it's an industry we have to build here. So there's going to have to be a moat built. So the creativity from the Trump administration has been welcome to the industry, frankly. Can China shut us off?  They absolutely can. Yeah, they more or less have. They're starting to let it eek out. But it's like anything else, right? Like, if they shut us off, it just, it escalates, and that gets dangerous for them, I would think. It does. I mean, there's a balance here, right? I mean, if they overplay their hand, then we're going to just do it much faster and drop them, right? Let me leave you with this. Where are we, say, in a decade?  In a decade, I think we're going to have a number of operating mines here in the U.S. We'll have a good amount of those rare earths being mined here. And I think we can build up our magnet and metal manufacturing within a decade to support U.S. industry. All right.

The auto pen is, you know, legal.  As you know, other presidents used it, including Trump. Now, Biden relayed the decisions were always his and that there were plenty of witnesses. They were discussed, documented, executed. But the Times also reporting something else. When it came to clemency, President Biden didn't approve every name that came across his desk. Obvious question there. So who did? Additionally, when it came to clemency, Biden only used his own hands.  rather than the auto pen once.

Scott Bolden, laughing at that one, NewsNation political contributor. Carla Sands, former ambassador to Denmark and Greenland. And Joe Cunningham with us for the first time, former Democratic congressman from the great state of South Carolina, well represented on this show, that state is. Hello to you all. Hello. Thanks for being here. Appreciate it. You satisfied with that response from Joe Biden?  I just want Joe Biden to go away like a former president. And why talk about the auto-pin when that plays directly into the Republicans' talking point? Here's what I was trying to figure out today. I could sit here and say, you know what, all Joe Biden has to do is come out and talk and say whatever he wants and it ends it, right? And so he came out and he talked, and it obviously doesn't end it, but I get to the question of why now? Why do you think he came out now for this?  Because I think that he is really concerned about the Republican narrative about his presidency and his competence. He should have been talking about the 2005 DOJ memorandum that said the auto pen is effective and constitutional to use it. Donald Trump's used it. Every other president's used it. And why not talk about that to put it to bed, this Republican narrative? Donald Trump doesn't know whether Biden was all there or not. He's just he just speaks in this hyperbole and his MAGA supporters just eat it up.  Then make it true. So, I found it fascinating, Joe, that the one clemency that he signed by hand was his son, Hunter. Yeah.  I mean, it's a loser of an issue for Biden to be talking about. Any time they roll him out to speak on this, it hearkens back to the lack of credibility the Democratic Party has right now. I'm in South Carolina, so we have every presidential contender or wannabe contender coming through our state. And when I see folks come through, not rip the Band-Aid off on President Biden and the fact that he should not have run for re-election in the first place, and it should have been an open process, a Democratic process, especially coming from a party that says, save democracy.  That's old history, though, so... But it all goes back to credibility, though. It may be old history, but, you know, you can talk about anything you want, but unless somebody is credible, and right now the Democratic Party doesn't have the credibility, it's because of those old issues, as you say. They need that to move forward. You give him any credit for coming to speak out on this? I mean, he had to answer the question at some point. Biden? Yeah. I want more Joe Biden interviews. The Republican Party, more, more, more every day. He needs to be out here with you tomorrow night, like, doing an interview. I'd love to talk to him. I mean...

The people were worse off at the end of their presidencies. And I think it's time for new blood. But they keep beating these same dead horses and taking the 20% issues on big issues. The 20%, well, we have the 80% on President Trump's team.  What about to Carla's point, Joe, of Barack Obama coming out and giving this advice? Again, I have a lot of respect for former President Obama. I think he lost a little bit of credibility when he did not call for an open process after Biden stepped aside. And again, that goes back to the ethos of the Democratic Party and basically repairing that credibility. Hold on, you're a Democrat and you're trashing your party right now. What gives you the hope? I'm being honest. That's trashing.  Listen, I would rather hurt them with the truth than comfort them with a lie.

And coming up on Elizabeth Vargas Reports, why one columnist says Zoran Mamdani is not the answer for New York City's working class. That's seven minutes out. My take on the other side of the break. Stay with us.  on the top stories here is what's trending right now on the hill dot com this is the big one in this town today the president announcing uh... can flip forward to it every other president announcing a big weapons deal for ukraine in its war against russia on those weapons going through nato the president says that the u s will be paid for those weapons this is the back-and-forth over the weekend between the vice president of the gala california governor jay uh... gavin newsome  The VP was over at Disneyland, and the two went back and forth at each other on social media. And I actually watched this live yesterday. Chelsea star Cole Palmer on Trump joining team for trophy ceremony. I was a bit confused. The players were up there getting their awards from the president after the big FIFA team event. And it was fascinating watching the players interact with the president of the United States. They obviously don't do that often.  To check out these stories and more, all you have to do is scan the QR code on your screen or head on over to thehill.com for the very latest. All right, time for my take now. And I talk about AI, artificial intelligence, a lot on this show, a lot more than you will see anywhere else on cable TV.  And just look at how this week is starting. Today, the Pentagon unveiled it's awarding a contract up to $200 million worth to Google, OpenAI, Elon Musk's Grok, and Anthropic. Now, the government says they want the best AI talent solving for military use cases.

There never has been a client list. A client list suggests that Jeffrey Epstein made a list of people to whom he trafficked women. What there is, is a redacted FBI affidavit  from accusers, there are several of them, from accusers that accuse Jeffrey, that accuse various people of having improper sex. And that has been redacted. The names of the people accused have been blacked out. Now, of course, because I was the lawyer and I did all the investigations, I know who all these people are. I could figure out, based on everything that  I saw who Mr. X is, Mr. Y is, and Mr. Z. I can tell you right now, none of them are public figures who are currently in office. Some of them were previously in office. Some of them are dead. But there is no client list.  And the redactions could be undone if you go to court. So, many of the things that are being suppressed are being suppressed by two judges in Manhattan. And they're doing it largely to protect the alleged accusers, who are, in the view of the judges, victims, even though we don't know what their actual status is, but the judges have  issued orders, which is why I can't disclose things I'd love to disclose, saying that you can't disclose this information. But Pam Bondi and the Justice Department and Donald Trump are not responsible for that. I don't know of any information that they could disclose that they haven't disclosed. Now, maybe there is some, but I'm simply not aware of it. And so I think it's important to place the blame where the blame deserves to be placed.  The vast majority of people who are in the files\u2014and I know them all. I've seen all the names. The vast, vast majority of them have already been disclosed. They're in articles all over the world. They're in books that have been written. So, if we got everything, everything, you would be shocked how few  Names are there that haven't already been disclosed. The media hasn't, by the way, done a good enough job in finding the people who have been disclosed in the public record. So that's that list. Then there's the videotapes. People say there must be sex tapes. I know the whole story there. There is a videotape, maybe several videotapes.  They came under the following circumstances. Before any of this happened, Epstein was robbed by one of his employees of money and of a licensed gun. And he called the Palm Beach police, and they installed video cameras, not in the bedrooms, but in the living room.  And those video cameras recorded some people, but there's no sexual allegations there. So, there's nothing to that. And then there's Tucker Carlson's absurd allegations about the Mossad. There, I know it from very, very personal experience. Why?  I was representing Jeffrey Epstein. I asked him about everything, including whether he had any contacts with intelligence agencies. If he had, he would have been dying to tell me that, because I could have used that to get him a better deal. If he had worked with the Mossad or the CIA, that would have been golden for me. But, of course, he said no. And then I checked it with my sources in Israel.  Let me clear. I once represented the Mossad. When five Israeli Mossad agents were captured in Cyprus, the head of the Mossad asked me to represent them. I did. I got them out. And the Mossad sent me a congratulatory note. I'm friendly with many of the people who have been heads of the Mossad. I'm not going to tell you who my sources are, but I can tell you with absolute certainty he had no connections to Mossad.  He only got connected to Israel very late in this when he met Ehud Barak and he made business dealings with him. But there was no connection to Mossad. The reason that story generated is because his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell's father, probably did have a connection to Mossad, Robert Maxwell, but it had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. And as far as the suicide is concerned,  Of course it was a suicide, but it was a suicide, I believe, assisted by jailers. It was not a suicide that he could have committed alone. I think the jailers had something to do with his cellmate being dismissed, with the cameras being turned off. So there are things that can be hidden. But there's no smoking gun here, and there's no fault on the part of this administration, as far as I can tell."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 297.065, "text": " Thank you for watching.

Six months into his administration, we are starting to see if he will be a transformational president. He faces two crises inside his own coalition, inside MAGA, Epstein and immigration.  Epstein is a crisis of confidence in the base. Immigration will test his willingness to defy the base for his legacy. As we've noted, the president has wins so far that are significant. Stock market highs, Iran strike success, tariffs now bringing in serious cash, a closed border. Establishment Washington said all of those things were impossible. But the Epstein case is unlike every other kerfuffle President Trump and his administration, Trump 2.0, have faced.  Because the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files is not a case of MAGA vs. the media, because then MAGA can fight back against the media. And there have been a lot of made-up scandals so far in the first six months. Where was MAGA vs. the media? And MAGA's won. Just think about Signalgate. Remember?

Welcome to Mad Money. Welcome to Kramerica. Other people are my friends. I'm just trying to make a little money. My job is not just to entertain, but to educate you. So call me at 1-800-743-CBC or tweet me at Jim Kramer. They don't start big.  But we're beginning to see deals, important ones, and they aren't getting enough attention from the market, or from the media for that matter. If anything, even the unofficial start to earnings season, they're being dismissed, and that's just plain stupid. I was on downgrade today of Goldman Sachs, the principal deal house, and I almost have to laugh about how wrongheaded that is. Sell, sell, sell.  Oh, and let's not forget, these mergers aren't just good news for the investment banks. They're good news for the entire stock market, which may be sensing something, because we started the day down big, and then rebounded with the Dow closing up 88 points. This will be advancing 0.14%, and then as a gaining 0.27%. You know what? It's actually a stupendous comeback, especially in light of some of the incredibly aggressive, some would say negative, tariff news from the president this weekend. Everywhere I went, people said, oh, boy, I guess the market's going to be down big on Monday. I said, no, not so fast.  Regular viewers know that I think we have two markets here. Big institutional investors, they've generally been selling, but individual investors have been buying stocks hand over fist. I don't think they seem to care about the tariffs. They know that everybody sold after the Liberation Day announcements, and anyone who did, it turned out to be a big mistake. They missed a big move.  But don't be so short-sighted. We're seeing the beginnings of an M&A boom here. Even as it may not feel like it, because often the deals seem, well, dowdy, or let's say, not clear yet, or in the future. I mean, you could have seen it on Kraft Times. It's reportedly breaking up soon. People are yawning. So what? They're saying big deal. I say, no, that is dead wrong.  Company said to be planning to keep its faster growing brands like maybe Heinz Ketchup, a lot of new derivatives there, Kraft Mac and Cheese, Pacific, I'm sorry, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, while separating the brands with the slowest growth like Oscar Mayer packaged foods, Velveeta Cheese. The deal putting Heinz and Kraft together sounded like a match made in heaven in 2015. How could it fail? Great name brands, orchestrated by Warren Buffett and the brilliant people from 3G Capital, the uber successful Brazilian private equity firm, felt like the center of the store blockbuster.  But then people stopped going to the center aisles of the supermarket, and that spelled trouble for Oscar Mayer, for Jell-O, for Miracle Whip, for Maxwell's, for Velveeta, which apparently can survive thermonuclear war, and Cheez Whiz of Whiz Whip fame if you go to Geno's in Philly, which remains my go-to place when I head to the city of Brooklyn.  Here's what's amazing. People now think these brands have no value. But you know what. That's what they said about W.K. Kellogg. The cereal business when it split with Kellogg Nova the fast growing part of the Kellogg family which of course got a bid until the cereal choir couldn't couldn't resist C.R.E.A.L. and S.E.R.I.A.L. cereal choir. Ferraro stepped up and paid three point one billion for the maker of Fruit Loops and Corn Flakes. That was some deal last week. It was amazing.  Sure it's supposed to be a nightmare in a world where human health and human services secretary RFK Jr. is on a crusade against food coloring. But it was a dream come true for Ferraro which has spent 13 billion dollars in 10 years to expand around the globe. They don't want to be just a small Italian company. My feeling is that if Giovanni Ferraro sees value in food loops he might see some value in some of the Kraft Heinz brands too. Or consider Kenview.  Two years ago this company was spun off by Johnson and Johnson which went to unload his fantastic consumer business. Think like Tylenol, Neutrogena, Listerine, Aveeno, Sudafed, Pepsin, Band-Aid, Zyrtec and so many others all under one roof. The company picked this fellow Thibaut Mangan. He's the leader. He was the leader of J&J's consumer health division to run it.  We learned today that he was sacked after activist pressure and Kirk Perry, a current director, was named interim CEO. Kenview also announced a strategic review of its brand stable. That's what we're hoping will happen at Kraft Heinz. Is this shocking? Was it amazing that Kenview already got rid of the CEO in two years? Well, yes, if you saw the numbers.  Can you reported minus 4 percent organic growth. And Walsh was expecting plus 2 to 4 percent. But I bring this up because more deals are coming in that space. Any one of the majors we thrilled to snap some of these brands because there's very little organic growth in the industry. The only way you can have any growth is by it.  All right, now how about this merger today between Beckman Dickinson, the Life Science and Diagnostics Division, which have been shopped extensively, and Waters, a really strong company. We've had them on. A dominant player in exactly those fields. The deal was done in a very confusing reverse Morris Trust way, which is one of those tax saving situations that the street almost always hates, but the CEOs think is so smart. And they hate it because they aren't easy. They're not clean.  The merger was greeted with horrors for waters which saw its stock plunge 13.5 percent. That's part of the greeting. It shouldn't have been down that much but people didn't understand it. Back in things since getting a thirty nine point two percent stake in the newly combined waters it enters tell you this morning its stock actually finished in the black.  seemed like a great deal to me, especially because the company got $4 billion in cash and assumed $4 billion in debt. Really good deal for Beckton Dickinson. But again, it's hard to get your head around, so it didn't bring out many buyers, at least not today. Believe me, that will change and people say that not everyone lost. Oh, by the way, big winners included Barclays, which represented Waters in Citi, worked with Beckton Dickinson in a $17 billion transaction. They made out like bandits.  Well, how about one of tonight's guests, Huntington Bank shares, which announced today it was buying Veritex. I thought it was a tech company. No, it's a Dallas-based bank for $1.9 billion. I know, not huge, but it puts Huntington in the queue to shed its regional status, become much more of a national bank, at least in the parts of the nation that are good for business. CEO Steve Steinauer says that Veritex will help his Ohio-based bank move into a number of cities in Texas, which is one of the great growth states in the union.  I think this is the kind of deal we'll start to see more and more of now that we have a new banking regulatory regimen and antitrust authorities that won't reflexively block acquisitions. We'll talk to Steve Steiner later in the show about how this acquisition fits into Huntington's aggressive long term plans. In the end what matters is that deals are getting done even if they're sometimes being done at prices that don't people don't like like the waters deal.  I'm extremely confident that someone will want some of Kenview, if not all of Kenview, because those brands grow slowly. But if you put a bunch of them together, you might have something that Wall Street is very excited about. And again, it's not just about the takeover targets. These M&A deals are incredibly lucrative for the banks that orchestrate them.  The results won't necessarily be seen this quarter, so I can see why Citizens JMP, a brokerage house, might take Goldman Sachs from buy to hold. Goldman reports Wednesday, and you won't see the bump in numbers from the deal market yet. However, these Heart of July deals are terrific for the fall. You don't usually get a lot of deals during the summer, and I don't think it makes sense to sell Goldman here and then try to get back in it later. Good luck.  Even if they miss the quarter on Wednesday, it's not going to stay down for long. I'm clearly not alone as the stock actually rallied more than eight bucks today despite this downgrade. Here's the bottom line. You don't get a wave of deals out of nowhere. You get a ripple and then ever bigger waves. Right now we're in the ripple stage. That's when it's best to do some buying.  By the way, even if you think brands like Maxwell Health and Visine and Corn Pops died years ago, don't worry about it. They may not be excited to you, but there are plenty of potential buyers who are excited about that. We'd be happy to snap them up, and the regulators are no longer blocking every M&A deal under the sun. As we head into the bank earnings tomorrow, don't think about the past with Washington leaning against every deal. Think about the future, where it looks like the government is encouraging deals and is in no mood to get in the way of capitalism, at least the way we used to know it. Let's go to Rick in Oklahoma.

Here's what's amazing. People now think these brands have no value, but you know what? That's what they said about W.K. Kellogg, the cereal business, when it split with Kellanova, the fast-growing part of the Kellogg family, which, of course, got a bid. Until the cereal choir couldn't resist, C-E-R-E-A-L-N-E-S-S-E-R-I-A-L, cereal choir Ferraro stepped up and paid $3.1 billion for the make of Froot Loops and Corn Flakes. That was some deal last week. It was amazing.  Sure, it's supposed to be a nightmare in a world where Health and Human Services Secretary RFK Jr. is on a crusade against food coloring, but it was a dream come true for Ferraro, which has spent $13 billion in 10 years to expand around the globe. They don't want to be just a small Italian company. My feeling is that if Giovanni Ferraro sees value in Fruit Loops, he might see some value in some of the Kraft Heinz brands, too. Or consider Kenview.  Two years ago, this company was spun off by Johnson & Johnson, which wanted to unload its fantastic consumer business. Think like Tylenol, Neutrogena, Listerine, Aveeno, Sudafed, Pepsi, Band-Aids, Zyrtec, and so many others all under one roof. The company picked this fellow Thibaut Mangan, he was the leader of J&J's consumer health division, to run it.  We learned today that he was sacked after activist pressure and Kirk Perry, a current director, was named interim CEO. Kenview also announced a strategic review of its brand stable. That's what we're hoping will happen at Kraft Heinz. Is this shocking? Was it amazing that Kenview already got rid of the CEO in two years? Well, yes, if you saw the numbers.  Canview reported minus 4 percent organic growth, and Wall Street was expecting plus 2 to 4 percent. But I bring this up because more deals are coming in that space. Any one of the majors would be thrilled to snap some of these brands because there's very little organic growth in the industry. The only way you can have any growth is buy it.  All right, now how about this merger today between Beck and Dickinson? This was the Life Science and Diagnostics Division, which had been shopped extensively, and Waters, a really strong company. We've had them on. A dominant player in exactly those fields. The deal was done in a very confusing reverse Morris Trust way, which is one of those tax saving situations that the street almost always hates, but the CEOs think is so smart. And they hate it because they aren't easy. They're not clean.  The merger was greeted with horrors for waters, which saw its stock plunge 13.5 percent. That's part of the greeting. It shouldn't have been down that much, but people didn't understand it. Beckton Davidson is getting a 39.2 percent stake in the newly combined waters, yet after selling off this morning, its stock actually finished in the black.  Seemed like a great deal to me, especially because the company got $4 billion in cash and assumed $4 billion in debt. Really good deal for Becton Dickinson. But again, it's hard to get your head around, so it didn't bring out many buyers, at least not today. Believe me, that will change and people say that not everyone lost. Oh, by the way, big winners included Barclays, which represented Waters in Citi, worked with Becton Dickinson in a $17 billion transaction. They made out like bandits.  Well, how about one of tonight's guests, Huntington Bank shares, which announced today it was buying Veritex. I thought it was a tech company. No, it's a Dallas-based bank for $1.9 billion. I know, not huge, but it puts Huntington in the queue to shed its regional status, become much more of a national bank, at least in the parts of the nation that are good for business. CEO Steve Steinhauer says that Veritex will help his Ohio-based bank move into a number of cities in Texas, which is one of the great growth states in the union.

As in P-A-R-C, your money in these four stocks to stop worrying about tariffs, China, the Fed, pretty much anything else. Just enjoy the magic carpet ride.  If you're a tape reader as I am, then you've noticed that you tend to see four stocks go by more than any others. Palantir, Applovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase. Park. They're the meme stocks of this era. Stocks that long ago kind of ceased to be stocks, at least in a traditional way. They now become chits in the great game that is the stock market. And they're moved up like the old GameStop through sheer force of buying from home gamers who refuse to sell. Except that unlike GameStop, these are all amazing growth companies.  It's exciting to see how the mean people have figured it out. Buy the stocks of companies that are doing well and don't worry about how much you pay for them if they have great growth. There will always be someone who will want to pay more for growth. And they are right, because growth is the only safety in this market. That's why today I said I wanted to find an acronym for them, not to ridicule them, but actually because I enjoy them. I'm thrilled for them. I got to see that they're getting it. I wanted a consensus.  around these four insanely strong stocks and how they just don't have any quit in them. So Park has been born. There were others that people, let's just say now many people in my Twitter file, chose to use a far less flattering anagram embracing the same four letters in reverse order, perhaps because they don't understand how this game works.  So let me tell you, first, all four of these companies are actually fabulous businesses, well run with dynamite financials, great leadership, even if their stocks have certainly rallied to gonzo levels. Palantir is among the fastest growing tech companies I can recall. It's got a projected annual growth rate of 18 to 25 percent out to 2030, with a market capitalization of $352 billion. May not sound that impressive. Two years ago, it was $35 billion.  What does Palantir do? I say, what doesn't it do? You bring Palantir in to look at patterns to figure out how to run your business better. I've never heard anyone say that they aren't terrific at what they do, making your company money almost the minute you bring them in. They're also trying to make the Pentagon more efficient, but that's a tall order. I hope they succeed. So should you.  Applovin is a hugely profitable way for companies to advertise through mobile video games, which are typically free as long as you watch the ads. This company's got software and AI solutions that make its model unassailable. They have no real competition. The revenue growth is stunning. It was a $10 billion company two years ago. Now it's $120 billion, as this is the company that can get your ad in front of everyone who plays games on their phone. I know it's richly valued. I don't care. When you have no competition, well, guess what?  You do pretty darn well. Do I have to describe Robinhood to you? It's an app. No, it's a bank. No, it's a repository of wealth for the millennials, whatever you want to call it. Robinhood has 25 million accounts and it offers ETFs, options, gold, and crypto. It came out of nowhere. This company was worth $11 billion two years ago. Now it's $88 billion. Again, incredibly profitable. Out of nowhere. It seems to have captured young people who would otherwise not bother to invest. You know what I say? Hallelujah.  Finally, Coinbase means crypto. 52 million Americans have kept their crypto there, part of 100 million users globally. It's the only crypto company in the S&P 500, so it's the perfect poster child for the group. Again, Coinbase, immensely profitable, and at 40 times earnings, it's actually the cheapest of the group. How can that be?  All right, there you got it. It's Park. Now, why did I think of this? Because on Friday, we held our CNBC Investing Club annual meeting. It was a joyous event. We really lit it up. One individual wanted to know if we'd ever recommend speculative stocks. I said, we run a charitable trust. And while I approve of speculation, most people don't, I didn't feel it was in keeping with our mission. But I thought about it all weekend. I realized that I should just give you the list of stocks where it seems like if you enter a sell order and it was found out, they'd tar and feather you.  Is there any valuation that would be too much to pay for park? I can tell you from where I stand, absolutely not. The money is parked in these names. The buyers are insatiable. They are for speculation about as great a gift as you could possibly have. At least for now and probably for some time to come. Just remember to ring the register for some of it on the way up. Try to take out your cost basis and then the ultimate thing you could do, play with the house's money. Oh, shh, I won't tell anyone that you sold it, I promise.

Angela Stend is senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. She's also the author of Putin's World, Russia Against the West and With the Rest. She's a former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council, also served in the Office of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State.

Probably a country like Turkey as well, which purchases a lot of Russian oil.  So they are threatening those countries. I believe that President Trump said 100 percent tariffs. There's a Senate bill which would impose 500 percent tariffs, secondary tariffs on these countries that purchased Russian hydrocarbons. So that's the real threat. Not so much to Russia. Angela, how meaningful would it be for these countries?  So, I mean, it would be meaningful because they are the largest purchases of Russian oil. But then we don't know how they might retaliate. India, of course, is a country that's been drawing closer to the United States.  So to have that kind of tariff on India would also, I think, affect other aspects of the US-Indian relationship. So I think they're kind of all waiting. I should say that saying that Russia has 50 days to end the war, you have to realize that Russia is now in the middle of a very brutal summer offensive.

So that enables President Trump to say to his base, well, we're not spending any more money on Ukraine.

I mean, Putin's not going to stop until he really believes that he's not going to win this.

President Trump reversed that order that apparently he hadn't heard about before. So yes, I think this is still a contentious issue within his base. Is that enough to help Ukraine? I mean, Ukraine just needs an enormous amount of these  Patriot batteries. If it gets 17 extra ones, that's terrific. Ukrainians themselves are manufacturing their own drones now. They're also making deals with European countries to co-produce them. But we really don't know whether that is enough, because the Russians are also stepping up their production of weapons.

So at the moment, things are very difficult for Ukraine. And I think only very significant numbers of weapons can help them push this back. And they also do have a mobilization problem. Russia has many more people that can mobilize. It's got North Koreans fighting for the Russians. The Ukrainians do face the shortage. And they are so far refusing to draft 18 to 25-year-olds.

The money behind Elon Musk's trillion dollar empire is increasingly flowing in one direction, and that's toward AI. Musk said on Sunday that he plans to hold a vote by Tesla shareholders on whether the company should invest in XAI, the cash burning AI startup that he founded two years ago. It comes shortly after SpaceX, his mammoth rocket launch company, agreed to invest about two billion dollars into the AI firm. This, according to people familiar with the matter.  Dana Hall and Ed Ludlow write about Elon turning to Tesla and SpaceX to fuel his ambitions. Dana Hall is Bloomberg News senior technology reporter. She's also a contributor to the Elon Inc. podcast. You can catch new episodes of that every single week wherever you get your podcast. She joins us from our San Francisco bureau.  Dana, Tesla is, I know it's not a car company, because we're told it's not a car company. I heard you chuckle there. We're told it's not a car company. They do Optimus, they do the self-driving stuff, but listen, what moves the company's stock? How many cars they delivered? Do they have any business, according to the folks you talked to, making an investment in this money-losing AI company?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 569.545, "text": " Yeah, so the money needs of XAI are enormous. I mean, billions of dollars are pouring into artificial intelligence. There's huge need for compute and data centers. And XAI is building out this big data center in Memphis called Colossus. And as we've seen so often with Elon Musk, he runs five companies, but they're not really separate. They have overlapping investors, engineers, management,  sometimes boards, and Musk often, I don't want to say robs Peter to pay Paul, but he will co-mingle his companies in a way that is very unlike any other corporate CEO that we've seen. And I think in his mind, AI is the future.  Tesla is also an AI company. If they can invest in XAI, they maybe get preferential access to Grok. We're already seeing that Tesla is now integrating Grok, the chat bot, into its cars. We know that Tesla has sold Megapax to XAI for that Memphis data center. So, they already are working together quite a bit.  And I think, you know, a lot of investors, particularly the retail investors, see this as a way to get in on XAI. I mean, so there probably is a fair amount of shareholder support for this idea, at least from the retail side."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 642.099, "text": "Yeah.

We know that Tesla is having a shareholder meeting on November 6th. We have not seen a proxy yet, but this idea is something that Musk has floated for over a year now. I mean, I think he first polled people on X, like should Tesla invest $5 billion in XAI like a year ago? And so it sounds like now it's likely to be in the proxy.  So, I mean, because it is a publicly traded company, shareholders have to weigh in. It would be a sizable investment for Tesla."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 693.148, "text": "I want to read a post that you link to in the piece that you and Ed wrote. It's from Grok on X. First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced. We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse.  This was on Friday, Dana, and it was about the horrific behavior. It was referred to itself as Mecca Hitler, and it had posts that praised Adolf Hitler and appeared to call the Holocaust, quote, effective. This is this is the chat bot for XAI. Is this thing ready? Like like if you're a Tesla investor,  Do you have pause about sending money from Tesla to a company that has made a mistake such as this in the AI race?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 747.772, "text": "I know, right?

You know, Tesla obviously joined the S&P 500 back in December 2020. And then there's this very rapid  retail shareholder base that is wildly enthusiastic, very on board with Elon, and they're really betting on Elon in the future. And if the future is not car sales, it's got to be something. And so I see that this is all part of Elon's big plan to really position himself  as a leader in AI. Remember that XAI was founded after OpenAI by his rival, Sam Altman, came out with ChatGPT, and so you're seeing Grok try to be a big player in this field. Yes, they have absolutely made mistakes. The whole Hitler thing from last week was horrible. I think it's notable that Grok apologized, or XAI apologized, and they seem to be sorting it out.  Yeah, I mean, the other question I have is like, do Tesla owners want Grok in their cars? I mean, I'm assuming there's a way to opt out or not, you know, enable that if you want, but I don't think that when people buy a Tesla, they necessarily signed up for Grok."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 822.08, "text": " So Musk has, of course, really stepped away from that whole political sphere that he was in for a little while, but...

His handling of an expensive renovation of the Federal Reserve's headquarters.  I think if Jerome Powell stepped down, it would be a great thing. I don't know that he's going to, but he should. Jerome Powell's been very bad for our country. We should have the lowest interest rate on Earth, and we don't. He just refuses to do it, and yet he's spending $2.5 billion rebuilding the Fed.  That was President Trump just yesterday in Maryland. This construction project offers the clearest example yet of how Trump and those in his orbit are looking for every opportunity to scrutinize Jerome Powell's leadership at the Central Bank, even beyond his economic stewardship. Bloomberg News Federal Reserve reporter Amara Omokwe joins us now from our Washington, D.C. bureau. A $2.5 billion  renovation, the topic of the renovation coming up when Jay Powell defended the renovations as necessary during his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee late last month. Some of those are just flatly misleading. The idea of elevators, you know, it's the same elevator. It's been there since the building was built. So that's a mischaracterization. And some of those are no longer in the plans. You know, that's earlier. The plans have continued to evolve.  I do want to bring in Amara Amokwe. She's been writing about this.

And so that's kind of the Fed's rationale for these renovations. They were approved by the Fed's board.  several years  And then also taking issue with what Fed Chair Jerome Powell said about some of the design features in the renovation when he was on the Hill last month talking about these renovations. And some of the administration officials are basically alleging that Powell was not truthful in that testimony.  And that seems to be what they're using to kind of lay the groundwork to say that perhaps President Trump has cause to remove Chair Powell from his position on the Fed's Board of Governors, because, of course, to remove someone from the Fed's Board of Governors, you have to meet a very high legal standard, which is cause something like malfeasance or neglect of duty. And so some administration officials seem to be trying to use this renovation issue to try and establish that cause.  Amara, as you mentioned, this is not new. This renovation has been going on for quite some time now. But is this the first time that the magnitude of the renovation is really being questioned? Yeah, I would say so. And what kind of set this off was media reports about some of the features in the renovation.

They're up right now 3.4%. It's a new all-time high for the company after they reported net sales for the second quarter that came in in line with estimates from analysts up 8.6% over the same period last year.  This is a $52 billion market cap company. They distribute construction and industrial supplies, nuts, bolts, screws, anchors, rivets, and other fasteners, as well as industrial, janitorial, and safety supplies, cutting tools as well. The company sells to builders, manufacturers, governments, and more.  Really, it's a great read on the entire industrial and manufacturing economy, specifically here in the U.S. We've got with us the CEO of Fastenal, Daniel Flornes. He joins us from Winona, Minnesota. Dan, welcome to Bloomberg Businessweek Daily. Shares up today. Shares up more than 25% so far this year. New all-time high. In the earnings release, though, you said that, quote, the market conditions remain sluggish. What conditions specifically?  You know, we sell to a wide range of customers and industries, as you mentioned, across North America and in 26 countries in total, but mostly in North America. Our customer base has been relatively subdued for the last several years. In the fall of 2022, we saw some indicators saying it was going to slide. And we felt that as we moved into the second and third quarters of 2023. And it's been really weak since then.  About 30% of our business is very production-centered business within manufacturing. So are there any signs that that part of the business is improving, that those customers are seeing sentiment improve? Are you hearing anything from them?  I think the biggest sign that we're seeing is the knife has stopped dropping. You know, we were trying to catch that falling knife for a two year period. When I talk to our district and regional leadership throughout the world, the feedback I hear is, you know, they're not talking about this $200,000 a month customer whose business is off 60, 70%. You have a much more stability. Now it might be stable at a lower level than it would have been two years ago,  but it's much more stable and so it allows our inherent growth to shine through. So we've really been in this prolonged downturn, especially in the industrial economy. Are you seeing any particular green shoots or signs of inflection? And if so, which markets are you most optimistic about?  Yeah, so we're seeing some green shoots. For us, we are seeing some impact in energy. However, I would say that's probably more us taking market share than it is a lift in the tide.  About 25% of our business is outside of the industrial. And within there, we're selling, we're doing quite well. I hear a lot of commentary from our folks with data center builds, with even warehousing customers. And we've made really good inroads over the last three years into the government sector. And that primarily was an offshoot of COVID.  During COVID, when supply chains blew apart, we stepped in to serve a lot of that market when they were not being served. And those folks have remembered that, and we've grown our business there. So we need to, of course, talk about tariffs. How have tariffs really changed your thinking about product sourcing, particularly for fast centers, which we know, of course, are primarily sourced in China, Asia? What other options are you evaluating to mitigate the tariff impact here?  You know, so back in 2018, we did some short term moves of our supply chain, but it was fairly limited because you just can't change. There's so much QC involved with vetting suppliers that you couldn't move it fast enough. What we had done quietly over the last five, six years is continue in that progress.  because the tariffs that were put in place in 2018 were sticking, and we expected more of it to happen. And we wanted to better diversify the supply chain for our customer. We did look at a lot of options. There aren't a lot of options within North America. We looked at some options of doing some manufacturing ourself. The problem is the economics still didn't work. So it was really for us more about diversifying supplier base in general.  Are the economics of that going to work now in this new tariff regime? I think during the first Trump administration, the goal was to move things out of China, but as many companies are learning right now, it doesn't matter if it's China, Vietnam, or India, if it's not in the United States, there is going to be a tariff on it. At least that's what it seems like is going to be the case. Yeah. Um, economics still do not work. And, uh, and, and, and part of the challenge there,  isn't just the economics, it's the amount of time. When we were researching it, um, very in depth, uh, two and a half years ago, one of the, one of the challenges is it's easy to find a site. It's relatively easy to get a building up and get a supply chain set up. When I say relatively easy, I mean, timeframe of what it takes to do it. The most challenging aspect was the production equipment of how many, how many months it would take to get that.  And so that aspect really pushed us to look more at geographic dispersion of supply chain sourcing, because the economics are still very challenging. So how much of what you sell right now is actually made in the US? If I look across what we're sourcing, what our branded suppliers are sourcing,  We've always estimated less than 50% is coming from the US. And is that going to stay stable in this new tariff regime? I suspect it will. Okay.  So I know Fastenal raised prices back in April, especially as a result of tariffs. Historically, I mean, the company has been able to pass on pricing costs. What's really been the feedback here from customers? Has there been much pushback in terms of the ability and appetite for customers, frankly, to take on additional pricing, especially as we head into the second half of the year? First off, we sell into a very competitive market. There is always pushback. The real challenge in the equation is communication.  And one thing that helps in our supply chain, we're directly sourcing from the manufacturer that's producing the product, more so than most of our competitors in the marketplace, just because of our scale. And so we have the ability to see into the future farther than a lot of our competitors. And it puts us in a position to communicate very well. It puts us in a position to take steps as the inventory is turning.  The one unfortunate part of that, it also can create fatigue for your customer. And I would say our customer is at the fatigue point right now of where it's become challenging, but it always is. And it's all about communication and trust.  We're speaking with Fastenal CEO Dan Flornes. The company reported earnings earlier. Shares are higher, reached a new record today. Shares up right now by about 3.7%. I want to talk a little bit about the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that became law on the 4th of July this year. In the press release for your earnings, you did mention it, but big picture, what does it mean for your customers and for your business?  You know, big picture what it means for our customers is if you look at some of the depreciation rules and the timing, it makes it very advantageous to make capital investment. And so that's the biggest piece that we see impacting our customers, because our customers have, especially on the manufacturing side, an incredible amount of infrastructure that they're investing in. And so anything that allows them to depreciate faster,  And to improve the return profile is advantageous for our marketplace. And that's a that's a key element that we talked about in the release. I know that you talked a little bit about to us manufacturing your own products in the U.S. and your suppliers doing it. But I'm wondering about your customers and the way that these so-called America first policies might help them reshore manufacturing back to the U.S. Are you seeing any evidence or hearing discussion of your customers beginning to move manufacturing back to the U.S. ?  You know, I would say it's fairly limited, but again, that's not something that happens in six months that you set up. We've had some customers set up assembly operations, which you can do in a much shorter timeframe as opposed to pure production where you're manufacturing components yourself, or you're changing your supply chain to more domestic type supply. But what we've seen is,  a lot more willingness of making investment even beyond the manufacturing capacity in the short term. Fastenal has refocused on growing with larger customers. What are the key drivers there and what additional investments do you need to make to enable growth with those customers? Yeah, so a position we've put ourselves in for a number of years is we very aggressively made investments. And this was starting back 15 plus years ago.  of slowly building an infrastructure to move the supply chain closer and closer to the point of use. And what that involved for us is investing in a tremendous amount of vending infrastructure. And in more recent years, a lot more RFID type infrastructure to measure product movement within a facility so that you don't have to, with human capital,  physically observe product being diminished, you can monitor it electronically and remotely. And so we've made extremely large investments over the last 10 plus years.  in vending technology, and I'm pleased to say that vending technology is all manufactured in the United States. Yeah, I was surprised when I went to your website earlier today, as I was preparing for this, to see those vending machines. It's not something that I've run into, certainly in my life, but it's pretty cool to see that. It's a snack machine. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. It's like,  It's a snack machine, but you can't eat what's in there. So exactly. OK. Hey, we just got about a minute left and I just want to talk numbers real quick. Gross profit up forty five points to forty five point three percent up from forty five point one percent over the second quarter of last year. You said it was partially offset by higher import duty costs and higher fleet and transport costs. Are those costs in your view going to stabilize? They they're going to continue to rise because  Because of the way our supply chain works, we carry a fair amount of inventory because we have such dispersion in our locations. So we carry quite a few months of inventory. So that's going to keep ratcheting up as we're on a FIFO basis inventory. So as that inventory continues to turn, that will continue to ratchet up a little bit as we move into the third and fourth quarters and into 2026. What really helped us during the quarter and what drove the improvement in our gross margin  set aside the tariffs for a second. We put in place a faster expansion starting last summer to widen our inventory. And that's really what drove our margin this quarter. Dan Flornes, CEO of Fastenal. Really appreciate you joining us.

We are trying to develop close ties with India. We see India as a strong potential partner vis-a-vis China. And we've also been reticent in some ways to go after a number of Chinese banks and other Chinese entities. So I think, you know, with this tariff play, we'll see. It could have real ramifications, I think, for Russia's oil sector.  But it would also have real implications for the United States bilateral relations. And the thing we have to remember is part of what the Biden administration was trying to do was to keep Russian oil on the global market. We wanted Russia to take a haircut in terms of how much profit it was getting in terms of sales. But we didn't really have a problem with Russia selling oil. We just wanted to sell it at a haircut.  because we wanted Russian oil on the market to keep global prices low. The Trump administration, I think, is taking a bit more of a blunt approach.

So, you know, China does recognize that its oil dependence, its dependence on Russia as well as the Middle East, represents a real strategic vulnerability.

And the Saudis, I don't think were willing to. But with Trump, maybe it's different. I think the bigger, broader question here, though,  is that Trump has not shown a lot of interest in trying to really stick it to the Russians, economically or militarily. He has not demonstrated in the past a lot of support for Ukraine. If that is shifting, the question is how far does that shift? I think what we've seen is a partial shift,  The US now looks like it's going to continue military supplies. But there's no indication Trump is going to go to Congress, try to ramp up our production for Ukraine. And then the economic question is, how much of an economic hit is the president willing to absorb to stick it to the Russians in support of Ukraine? There's limits to what the Biden administration would do.  So I do have some doubts about how far we are willing to go. And I think Russia may just try to call our bluff here. And it'll be really interesting when the 50 or 60 days expire, whether that prompts sort of a strong US reaction.

Now, what I hope happens in the next 50 days is that there's a ramp up on European efforts to support Ukraine militarily. I think that's happening. But then also that the U.S. begins to negotiate with India and perhaps even with China to reduce oil flows from Russia into India, and that maybe there is talks with the Saudis about offsetting any cuts to Russian supplies on the global market.

We were running at about 25% of the proper level of munitions order. In other words,  When we needed four, we ordered one. When you do that over 20 years, you really create a deficit.

Iran has built a Shaheed drone factory in  Russia, after giving them thousands of their own Shaheed drones or selling them, they now have a factory there producing it. That's what's hammering the Ukrainian cities every night. And the third thing is China has been backstopping the economy with increases in imports and exports, but equally importantly, providing the microelectronics that are used in Russian cruise and ballistic missiles.  So all three of these countries, this axis of authoritarians are supporting the fourth Russia in this fight. And that's who Ukraine's been going against.

They had talked about releasing the files, the Epstein files to the extent there are in client lists. And now they're in this moment where they're trying to walk that all back.  But they've created this sort of intensity with their base, and the MAGA movement that Trump created really wants answers on this. And the idea that the carpet has been pulled out from underneath them so abruptly really isn't sitting well with them. Trump has traditionally been very Teflon with his base, where he can have missteps, he can have things they might slightly disagree with, but they always come home. But I can tell you, in the convention center in Tampa this weekend,  It felt different. It felt like this is going to be a little more difficult.

Director Patel has since put out a tweet publicly saying that he is not leaving, he's going to stay with the administration. I think, again, that's sort of  the effort to try to move beyond this moment, even if that might be a little more difficult for the White House. So Bongino is a podcaster, had a large media following, and he is among the people who helped amplify the Epstein stuff.

And again because Trump built  some credibility with his base on this issue is a main talking point for a very long time.

This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariff on any country that helps Russia and props up Putin's war machine. He can dial it up or down. He can go to zero to 500. He has maximum flexibility. But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.  All together, this is a significant turn in President Trump's posture toward Ukraine, as he deals with the practical reality that Putin remains a significant impediment to a long-sought peace deal to end the war. Joining me now is our team of superb reporters, NBC News Senior White House Correspondent Garrett Haake,  NBC News Senior National Security Correspondent Courtney Kube and our double chief, Chief Washington and Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell joins me on set. Great to have you here. Let me begin with you, Garrett, if I may. What more did we hear from the president about how he views this different kind of deal regarding weapons for Ukraine?  Well, I think the president here is trying to sort of split the middle here and provide weapons to Ukraine without providing weapons to Ukraine. He had a campaign promise to end this war on day one that obviously went out the window some time ago. But another one that said the U.S. would no longer be funding Ukraine's defense."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 241.133, "text": "Now he's able to allow for Ukraine's defense.  without funding it directly."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 244.979, "text": "And this includes those Patriot missile air defense systems that have been number one on President Zelensky's wish list, if you will, which will be coming from other countries. This is the other kind of benefit for President Trump, who has long talked about the idea that Europe needs to do more for its own defense. Here he gets to say that it's Europe providing these weapons, other NATO countries buying them from the US, and he can tout the superiority of American military hardware, another favorite talking point. From the White House's perspective, this is all a win-win.  And it was notable today, Garrett, that the president talked about the importance of a strong Europe, something we don't always hear from him. And part of that is some of Europe has had its own relationships with Russia over the years. What more do we know about how this could affect energy prices? Certainly, China is a big consumer of that.  Yeah, take a look at Mark Rutte's hand, the NATO Secretary General here, who's been kind of a guide for Donald Trump in dealing with Europe and dealing with NATO. I think you could probably argue pretty successfully to get to this point. The nature of these tariffs as secondary tariffs, not on Russia, a country with which we do little business of any kind right now, but on the other countries that buy their oil and gas, is significant. It's the kind of thing that could potentially raise prices in those countries on these  products and could raise global prices given the global nature of the energy economy here. So if you're China or Iran or another major importer of Russian oil, it might also increase your willingness to lean on Russia to end this war. This is just not the kind of thing that's good for the economies of any of the places in the graphics on your screen, potentially including the United States, which could see prices rise as well, again, given the global nature of the oil markets.  So it ratchets up the pressure, if you will, on Vladimir Putin in a variety of ways to make a deal of some kind and soon.  Thank you so much, Garrett. Let me turn now to our colleague Courtney, and obviously you can give us the picture of what does this announcement mean for the real fighting that's taking place on the ground. So it's symbolic in that the fact that President Trump is providing these weapons to Ukraine, but the reality is there are very few number of actual weapons or systems. They're going to be a game changer on the ground in Ukraine, and patriots are definitely not them.  But they will have the ability once, if in fact there are going to be multiple Patriot batteries brought into Ukraine that will defend against what we have seen are a barrage of Russian attacks in recent weeks. We're talking hundreds of missiles and drones being fired in just a day or just one night, Kelly. These Patriots will have the ability to defend against those, to save Ukrainian civilian lives. And that in and of itself should be enough to help bolster some of the Ukrainian momentum  hopefully, including on the battlefield, is the goal here by NATO to help bolster the fighting there. But the reality is, on a day-to-day basis, it continues to be a war of inches in Ukraine. And defensive systems like this are not likely to be able to push Russian military back in any real way.  and that cadence from Russia has been just alarmingly increased. When you consider the NATO piece of this, do you have any sense of how that will work? Is NATO ready to embrace this fully? NATO absolutely has been embracing this already. And one way that they may look at this weapons, this change, and how the U.S. is going to provide weapons and systems to Ukraine is a U.S. military component there called SAG-U.  It stands for Special, I forgot what the A stands for, Group Ukraine Assistance. That's the A, Special Assistance Group Ukraine. It's a military component that's based in Wiesbaden, Germany, and that's where the U.S. coordinates all of the assistance that they are providing to Ukraine.  NATO already works closely with SAG-U. Kelly, I could see a scenario where they only increase their coordination and cooperation, maybe even NATO taking a leadership role with SAG-U, and that they would be the ones to essentially distribute or coordinate systems moving into Ukraine going forward.  You are always fluent in acronyms, Courtney, I have no doubt. Thank you so much. Let me turn to Andrea. Andrea, so good to have you here with us.

President Trump's threat of new tariffs on Russia's biggest trading partners comes as he announces new tariffs on the nations the U.S. relies on for major trading relations, including a 30 percent tariff on most imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1st, unless they make a deal. That weekend announcement coming just days after the president threatened 35 percent tariffs on certain Canadian goods, also effective August 1st.  In reaction, the EU is pausing its proposed retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. until August 1st as it looks to continue negotiations toward a trade deal. But at least some EU officials appear skeptical the president will actually make good on these latest threats."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "EU", "Unfair"], "line": 34, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1211.909, "text": " Could I just add that until now, our American friends have achieved one deal and 23 threats. So it makes a lot of sense that those of us who are threatened compare notes, as the commissioner said. And I think we shouldn't underestimate our power."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 35, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1229.611, "text": " They're keeping track. NBC News Senior Business Correspondent Christine Romans joins me now. Anne, help us to put this into everyday terms. When you hear 30 percent tariffs on EU and Mexican imports, what could that look like for American consumers?  I mean, it's a huge new cost in the supply chain for medicines, for pharmaceuticals, for important, you know, highly skilled manufacturing equipment that comes to the United States. You know, French wine and Spanish olive oil and Italian cheese. I mean, just think of all of the different things. This trading relationship is 30 percent of the entire globe's trade is those 27 nations in that block and the United States.  huge. So the worry is it could cause some companies, some industries to have, you know, huge new costs and company and factory closures. It could mean new costs for American consumers. And if there's that retaliation that you talked about that's now on the table, but that retaliation, if it happened, it would really hurt American farmers and brewers and Kentucky bourbon makers and a whole bunch of really important industries that export to the EU.  more of that uncertainty that you've been talking about and helping us understand for months. So when you look at the fact that the EU has, at least for now, delayed its retaliatory tariffs, what is more likely at this point, do you think? Is the EU willing to negotiate or are they expecting President Trump to simply back down?  I mean, they have to keep negotiating. And what we're hearing is that they are indeed still talking. But when you listen to the people close to the president, Kevin Hassett, who is one of his top advisers, saying that they've been working on these deals, but the president is the one in the end,  who can decide what he wants for the American people and who wants more from what some of these countries have been offering. In terms of the EU, it's an incredibly difficult, difficult negotiating bloc. You have the self-interest of 27 different countries, and then you have the trading interests of the bloc itself. So, I mean, it must be very, very interesting to try to be the person or the team negotiating with the U.S. on behalf of 27 different countries.  I suppose it's good they're still talking. One other way we look at this is how seriously are markets taking the latest iteration, the president's threats now? Anything you're seeing there? Taking it in stride, and this is something that we're told is actually bullying the president. The president can see that the markets have not reacted dramatically.  That said, it was the worst first six months for the dollar, I think, in 50 years. So in dollar markets and in bond markets, we have seen sort of the strain. You got Bitcoin at record highs. That's an alternate sort of store of value. So that could very well be all of this controversy and drama has pushed people into Bitcoin, although this administration and this president and his family have been very bullish about Bitcoin and actually in that business. So that could be part of it there. But the Nasdaq at a record high today. So you have  some people who are kind of cautiously looking at this snapback in markets from April, when the president made his first, you know, threats and then paused them, and who are saying maybe the market could be ahead of itself if the president really does come through with these very, very strong and steep tariffs.  Christine, thank you so much. Really appreciate that. I want to turn now to some news that has just been developing, and this comes out of the Supreme Court. We just learned that the high court is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its staffing cuts at the Department of Education. In May, a federal judge blocked the administration from making those drastic cuts to the workforce.  And now in a six to three, so that's the conservative to the liberal bloc ruling along those ideological lines, the court says they can go forward. The White House is looking to lay off more than 1,000 people as part of its effort to dismantle the Department of Education.  And up next, former President Biden speaks out, calling President Trump and other Republicans, quote, liars amid GOP investigations into his clemency decisions and his mental fitness while Mr. Biden was in office. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  Welcome back. President Trump is facing a brewing revolt from his MAGA base after his Justice Department shot down conspiracy theories tied to convicted sex offender, the late Jeffrey Epstein. Conspiracy theories, which the president and multiple top DOJ officials had previously amplified. In a recent memo, the Justice Department said it won't release any more evidence in the Epstein case and reaffirmed that Epstein was not murdered,  died by suicide, and that he did not maintain a client list. Now, that has prompted fury from Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, who has threatened to quit over Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of this matter, and that is according to a source who has spoken with Bongino. Bongino's anger at Bondi and skepticism of the DOJ's conclusions is being echoed by the president's loyal base.  And it was on full display by some of the MAGA's most influential media personalities at a gathering of young conservatives this weekend in Florida."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1552.336, "text": "How many of you are not satisfied with the results of the investigation?

The fact that the US government, the one that I voted for, refused to take my question seriously, and instead said, case closed, shut up conspiracy theorist,  was too much for me. And I don't think the rest of us should be satisfied with that.  President Trump is tamping down on any rift and standing by his attorney general, Pam Bondi, appearing with her this weekend and defending her as, quote, fantastic on social media. Joining me now is NBC News senior national politics reporter Matt Dixon, who's been covering this story for us. And, Matt, glad you are here to help us kind of put this all in perspective. When you look at this firestorm in MAGA World, is this really a creation of the president's own making?  But to some degree, I was at that conference in Tampa that you just played some clips from."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1640.099, "text": "And there really is sort of a Frankenstein's monster element to all of this sort of the scandal or the controversy that's been created really over a few years in the sense that the Trump campaign had promised its base transparency on the issue. They had talked about releasing the files, the Epstein files to the extent there are in client lists. And now they're in this moment where they're trying to walk that all back.  But they've created this sort of intensity with their base, and the MAGA movement that Trump created really wants answers on this. And the idea that the carpet has been pulled out from underneath them so abruptly really isn't sitting well with them. Trump has traditionally been very Teflon with his base, where he can have missteps, he can have things they might slightly disagree with, but they always come home. But I can tell you, in the convention center in Tampa this weekend,  It felt different. It felt like this is going to be a little more difficult. And to your point, part of that is, you know, because Trump himself promised so much on this issue and now appears to be walking it back."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 39, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1700.041, "text": "There was definitely a bubbling energy there where you were.

It feels like Bongino could be on the outs. And there was initial reporting that if he left, Patel would leave as well. And there was sort of a rift between those two and Attorney General Pam Bondi. Director Patel has since put out a tweet publicly saying that he is not leaving, he's going to stay with the administration. I think, again, that's sort of  the effort to try to move beyond this moment, even if that might be a little more difficult for the White House. So Bongino is a podcaster, had a large media following, and he is among the people who helped amplify the Epstein stuff. So I think there is some sense he wants to preserve here and wants to make sure that he still has credibility with Trump supporters in the MAGA base when and if he leaves the administration."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 41, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1765.038, "text": " So that credibility question leads me to my next thought. It's not the first time we've seen the president sort of annoy his base. That happened when he engaged in the bombings on Iran, those who didn't want him to be involved in foreign wars. Does this anger over the Epstein files feel different in some way? Does it have more staying power?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 42, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1783.465, "text": " It feels like it. It's always hard to tell because you don't want to sort of be captured by the moment necessarily where there's the most intense reaction and then it goes away. But being in that room in Tampa I've covered a lot of Trump events. I've covered a lot of conservative conventions. It certainly felt different. And again because Trump built  some credibility with his base on this issue is a main talking point for a very long time. So to the degree that you can put the toothpaste sort of back in the MAGA tube feels like it might be a little more difficult this time, because one, the allegations are terrible that the Epstein, and two, excuse me,  The idea that, you know, messing with children and doing things like this has become a main tenet of sort of Trump's messaging, of MAGA's messaging. So this hits home. This is sort of guttural for a lot of his supporters. So it does feel a little different than, say, a policy fight or an issue over foreign policy.

Option two is they're engaging in a cover-up. So is conspiracy something that Democrats really want to wade into? They often use that as a political weapon against Republicans and certainly MAGA conservatives. Is this a place where Democrats want to be?  You saw two things today. One thing you saw Mark Vesey, who has one of these districts in Texas that the Republicans are wanting to redistrict in a special session, who came to the floor and said, yes, let's make all of this public. Let's jump. And that's a Democrat running right into the middle of this saying, yes, let's just open this up so everybody can see everything, which is a good political move for him. But the second thing is we're moving into  off your election cycles. And you've covered this, and it's all about for everybody at home, off your elections. It's not elections where everybody votes. And we have a problem with turnout. So mobilization and excitement is a big thing. Democrats try to look, Republicans try to look of how we can get our base to actually get motivated.

And after the break, we're on the ground in Texas, where heavy rainfall and more flooding is threatening recovery efforts as the search for the missing enters its second week. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  We're glad you're back. More rain is hampering recovery efforts in central Texas. The Kerr County Sheriff's Office is ordering all volunteers to leave the river area and move to higher ground because of more threatening weather. That's after as much as 10 inches fell over the weekend, halting efforts to find the more than 100  60 people still unaccounted for after the July 4th flooding. And this all comes as the Trump administration is defending the federal response to the catastrophic floods following the president's visit to the area on Friday. Now, on Meet the Press yesterday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem denied reports that thousands of calls from flood victims to FEMA call centers went unanswered. She also acknowledged and defended a new policy that requires her direct sign-off  on contracts or grants that spend more than $100,000. And that has raised concerns about the pace of aid distribution."}, {"keywords": ["Export"], "line": 64, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2377.364, "text": " It's not extra red tape, it's making sure everything is getting to my level and that it's immediately responded to.

My colleague, NBC News correspondent Ryan Chandler joins me. And Ryan, what is the latest that you are hearing on the search for those from the July 4th flooding? You're on the ground. What are you hearing?  Well, it's more difficult news, Kelly. This is the last thing that Texas needed. This entire central Texas region battered by rain through yesterday and into today, which is stalling the search and rescue efforts here and causing the need for a lot more rescues in other parts. We just heard from Governor Abbott, who increased the total death count for the state. We now know statewide 131 people have died due to flooding, including  of course, most of the deaths here in Kerr County. In Travis County, where Austin is, nine people are dead and three are missing. So that speaks to the urgent need to try and find as many people as possible. We have seen the helicopters, the ground teams working again today after taking most of yesterday off. Kerr County gave the all clear to them to resume their efforts yesterday afternoon. But with more rain, it's been hard to get things in the air and people in the water  This is dangerous work as it is, and this weather is not making it any easier, Kelly. And exhausting and emotionally wrenching certainly work as well. Are you getting a sense that some of the additional changes in the forecast are having really practical impediments for what they're trying to accomplish?  Yeah, absolutely. I'll tell you, we were out with the dive teams a couple days ago watching how they do their work. And they said they're literally trying to look for bodies in muddy water that is far deeper than they are used to. And the problem is with the forecast, even if it's not raining on top of us right now, if it's raining upriver, that's going to come down in the hours ahead. So they are preemptively making sure that they're not in the water as it  rises. We were at the base camp for thousands of volunteers yesterday and it was empty. We saw it a couple days ago. There were people cooking food for first responders, donating trucks and equipment. It was buzzing. It was a little depressing to see it empty because as much as these people want to help, they just couldn't yesterday, Kelly.  You heard we played a clip of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem talking about the administration's response. Certainly the White House and she have been saying it has been an exemplary response. Are you hearing any questions on the ground? What is it that in the community where people are really personally affected by this, are they seeing the speed of the government response as she describes it? Or do they have a different perspective based on the conversations you've had?  I'll tell you, we have seen FEMA workers on the ground collaborating with local, state, and federal resources today. We've seen the FEMA office that has stood up to help anybody who needs to come to them for disaster assistance if maybe their home has been damaged.  To be honest, I've noticed a bit of a disconnect between the ground truth here and the narrative that FEMA has been ineffective. I've been talking to first responders, search and rescue teams, asking them if they are happy with FEMA's resources, and a lot of them tell me,  What are you talking about? We haven't noticed anything different. We have everything that we need, whether that is from FEMA or from neighbors coming out with a chainsaw offering to help. It has been an outpouring of support. I have not heard from anybody who says we don't have enough to do our jobs here.  That's very helpful to gather that kind of on-the-ground perspective. Ryan, thank you so much. Stay safe there. Stay cool if you can. And still to come, there are conflicting reports on the conditions of detainees at a controversial new immigration center that's been called Alligator Alcatraz. We will have reactions from the Democratic and Republican lawmakers who had a tour of that facility this weekend. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  We're glad you're back with us, and we are following a number of developments in connection with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, including a court ruling limiting who ICE agents can arrest in Los Angeles. A federal judge issued that temporary restraining order on Friday, ruling that federal agents have been arresting people based upon their race or their spoken language. The Justice Department says it is appealing the decision.  Also, we're watching that lawmakers are providing drastically different accounts of the conditions inside Florida's new immigration detention facility that's been called Alligator Alcatraz. After a tour of the facility this weekend, Democrats described it as dirty, crowded, and unsanitary, while Republicans describe it as well-run and no squalor.  It comes as NBC News has exclusive new reporting on the conditions inside other detention centers. Immigration advocates tell NBC News that immigrants being held in ICE detention centers in at least seven states are complaining of hunger, food shortages, and spoiled food. A DHS spokesperson said in a statement, quote, any claim that there is a lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.  NBC News Chief Capitol Hill Correspondent Ryan Nobles joins me now. And Ryan, when we talk about a tour of members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, how did that come about? Who are we talking about?  Well, this is a group of Florida, members of the Florida delegation, both Republicans and Democrats, but it was really Democrats that pushed to get access to what's being dubbed Alligator Alcatraz. This was after they were initially denied access to this facility. They ended up getting a tour. They said that it was a limited tour of the facility and what they described were inhumane conditions. They say that the people that are detained in this facility are  packed into cages, as they describe them, as many as 32 people per one of these cells that divide the detainees that are being brought in. They say that it is hot, it is uncomfortable, and it is not the way a federal immigration detention facility should be run.  Obviously, the administration feels very differently about this. They think that this is an appropriate use of taxpayer funds and an appropriate way to run this process as they carry out their mass deportation plans. But obviously, this is a controversy that is just beginning, and Democrats are going to try and highlight it as much as they possibly can going forward.  And their visit, Ryan, seems like it would be instructive because the Homeland Security Secretary said to Kristen Welker, our colleague over the weekend on Meet the Press, that the administration wants to build facilities similar to Alligator Alcatraz in other places. So might this be a fight that plays out from Capitol Hill this fall and in other states?  I mean  full of funding to help support the Trump mass deportation effort. So there's every reason to believe that if the administration wants to create more facilities like this, they're going to have the ability to do it. And there isn't much that Congress can do to stop it. And that there's even much of a will for members of Congress to stop it.  I think it really much more becomes a campaign issue, Kelly, as we head into the 2026 midterms. Democrats are going to point to this as being an example of how the Trump administration has run just roughshod over this immigration policy and that their mass deportation plan goes too far.  When you talk about campaigns, I want to bring up a new Gallup poll that shows that Americans' views on immigration are more favorable now than they were a year ago. A record 79% say immigration is a good thing for the country. That's up 15 points from a year ago. Just 30% say immigration should be decreased compared to 55% a year ago. So should this be a red flag for Republicans that views might be changing?  I mean, if it is, they're showing no signs in that direction, Kelly. Republicans have long believed that immigration is what they call an 80-20 issue for them. They believe that there's nuance in these numbers. And when presented with the way they're going about enforcing immigration, that that likely will be favorable to voters in the upcoming midterms. And we'll end it right there. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate it. We're back tomorrow with more Meet the Press Now. But the news continues with Hallie Jackson right now.

On the East Coast, flights and travel already affected from a storm on the way, with all eyes turning to the South, where a tropical system could slam the Gulf. We've got it all covered. Plus, the investigation into the deadly fire that killed nine people at a nursing home. Why firefighters say more lives could have been saved.  Plus, President Trump trying to tamp down the backlash from his own base, defending how his team has handled the Epstein case. But is it enough? And whose jobs are on the line? Then, the parents of one of the college students murdered by Brian Koberger sitting down exclusively with NBC News. What they're saying about the possibility of closure. And brought to you by the letters, WTF, the Elmo hack spotlighting Sesame Street ahead of a key vote that could gut funding for public broadcasting later in the show.  Hey there, I'm Hallie, and tonight we are on the ground with extreme storms and intense fires in a couple key spots, including the Grand Canyon, where crews are racing to get a handle on two wildfires right along the North Rim. Both of them right now, 0% contained. They are ripping through the woods near the iconic National Park. You can see the flames, you can see the smoke here.  It's exploded in size, one of them doubling from roughly 20,000 to 40,000 acres overnight. That's why you're seeing some of these evacuations. And the whole thing has thrown a wrench into peak tourist season, with some parts of the park now closing for now. Officials say as many as 80 buildings are already gone, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge, destroyed in one of the fires. Fortunately,  We're not seeing any reports of anybody hurt so far. At the same time, in Texas, you've got torrential rain slamming this already decimated state. People are just starting to pick up the pieces, of course, after that catastrophic flooding 11 days ago, 12 days ago now.  Up and down the East Coast, you've got bad thunderstorms causing ground stops, delays at some big airports. And the National Hurricane Center is now watching the Gulf Coast for potential tropical system developing. We're going to have more on that in just a bit with meteorologist Violetta Yaas and Morgan Chesky in Texas. But I want to start with Camila Bernal in California. So the containment on these Grand Canyon fires, what is the expectation and where does this go?  Hey Hallie, so firefighters are just working around the clock. You mentioned that containment is still at 0%, but we are hearing that there's at least some progress specifically because of the air attack. So what they're doing is dropping as much retardant as they can, and that's really been their biggest help because of the fact that these are areas that are extremely difficult to get to. It is complicated for firefighters who are battling these flames, and we're talking about two different fires.  First, there's the White Sage Fire, and then there's the Dragon Bravo Fire. That Dragon Bravo Fire is the one that destroyed parts of the North Rim at the Grand Canyon, and the one that destroyed that lodge that you see on your screen. It is iconic. It is something that a lot of people like to go back to every year. And look, this is an area that only about 10% of the people that actually go to the Grand  canyon go to. But it is a for a lot of people becau lodge. So if you want to is one place that you loo spent a lot of time in t were many people who had over the weekend. We're t  And we're also talking about the firefighters that had to be evacuated over the weekend because of the danger of this fire and how quickly it came. Although there are a lot of questions as to the response to this fire because it started on the 4th of July. This fire started from a storm. There was lightning and that's how the fire first broke out.  The governor, Katie Hobbs, asking questions about the federal response to this fire, saying that this is something that needs to be looked at and analyzed to see exactly what happened with this response and how the fire continued to grow and eventually reach the North Rim.  of the Grand Canyon, the area where people like to go to. So it's not just the lodge, it's the visitor center, a lot of the cabins and the areas where some of the employees lived in. So a lot of the people that worked and lived there saying it is somber, that it is devastating and heartbreaking because, of course,  This is an area that is extremely meaningful to them, and then to see it all in flames is just heartbreaking. But those firefighting efforts, they are going to continue because, as we mentioned, this is just the beginning of this firefight, and it is very hot in the western part of the U.S., Hallie.  Camila Bernal, Out West, thank you. Let's take you to Texas now, specifically the central part of that state where we are seeing more rain, road closures, water rescues, even today, about a week and a half after those deadly floods devastated that area.

I think that's going to make a big difference, because we didn't have communication with a bunch of the camps. So for many of these camps, the only way they have to communicate with authorities is cell service. And once that goes down, they're more or less cut off. Yeah.  I want to bring in Morgan Chesky, who is joining us now from Kirk County. Morgan, we're glad to have you bring us those interviews, those series of questions that you put to these state and local officials here. When you talk about the camps, there's been a lot of attention on those camps, given just the disaster, the nightmare that so many parents are living through now with the ones who sent their kids. Talk us through sort of where that goes. What else we're learning about what kind of calms these camps had.  Yeah, Hallie, as far as communications with the camps, that's still very much one of the big questions here that I think authorities are trying to figure out as well. That state representative told me that he has been in contact with multiple camps. And it appears, at least early on, that the only way they had to communicate with authorities as that storm moved in, as those floodwaters rose, were cell phones.  adding that unfortunately cell service was at least temporarily knocked out when that river surged down from the headwaters to Hunt and then to Kerrville. One of the things that we've been hearing as well is that when people were stranded by those floodwaters up and down the river, they weren't able to communicate.  And that is why, going forward, there is a lot of discussion already about how to improve that service, whether emergency comms such as satellite phones or anything of that nature can be fully explored here, Hallie. I think one of the frustrating parts is that there are still a lot of unknowns at this point in time that people are hoping to find out sooner than later, especially when that special session starts come soon. Hallie?  Morgan, I can see that it looks, if not sunny, at least it's not pouring rain behind you here. We know that there are more than 100 plus people whose bodies have still not been recovered in the state of Texas around the state after the July 4th flooding. Has the recovery been able to resume today? Have you seen crews out there actively? Is that happening?  Yeah, Hallie, we have seen crews, dive crews as well, going into the water. Although I should add that it is still high right now because we had a lot of rain overnight. We know that if not here in Kerrville, there have been flood watches issued across much of the hill country.  And so there is certainly a tension being felt right now. We're not anticipating the kind of rain that, of course, led to this disaster. But even a little bit, Hallie, that can get these crews out of the water is just slowing down this ongoing search for, as you mentioned, so many people still missing. Hallie.  Morgan Chesky live for us there in Kerrville. Morgan, thank you. We are watching, of course, the situation there in Central Texas, but we're also looking at what's to come along the mid-Atlantic coast. Dangerous flash floods potentially there, and the possibility of a tropical system to develop around the Gulf Coast. People in that area really bracing for it. WNBC's Violetta Yaas is joining us now. We're glad to have you with us, Violetta. Talk us through the track and what you're watching.  Hey, Hallie. Yeah, well, we're off to a very stormy start this week across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. You can see the radar lighting up like a Christmas tree with torrential downpours from Massachusetts all the way down through the Virginias. Each red box that you see, that's a flash flood warning. So flash flooding is either about to happen or already happening with these torrential downpours that are also very slow moving. Now, expanding the picture here, we can see our flood alerts  Our flood watch is in effect for this evening, with 46 million people impacted by this. And of course, this couldn't be more poorly timed. It's rush hour in one of the most densely populated areas of the country. So we're seeing those delays pile up at Philadelphia Airport, at Newark, at JFK and LaGuardia. So it's going to be a very stormy evening here across the Northeast.  In terms of rainfall totals, we're looking at a general at least up to an age, but in those heavier downpours we could be looking at 3 to 5 inches. So this certainly enough to cause flooding, especially when the downpours are very slow moving. So that's going to be an issue as well as we head into the evening. That very heavy rain along the I-95 corridor. And again, the big problem with this, not only the amount of rain happening, but the fact that these thunderstorms are taking their time. They're very slow moving, so there's just unfortunately a recipe.  for flash flooding in this part of the country. And this type of flooding has actually been ongoing across parts of New York State. We have some video in from Newark Valley bringing in the heavy rain, the sort of very difficult conditions there with the water levels are rising. We're seeing some creeks rising as well. So, Hallie, unfortunately, this is something that has been ongoing in some places since yesterday. And we're going to continue to see it at least for another couple of hours. And what is the worst of that tropical system aimed at the Gulf supposed to hit?  Yeah, so we're expecting conditions there to start to deteriorate over the course of the next day or two. We don't have the system just yet, but there is the potential for development as this crosses the state of Florida. Right now, we're looking at a 30% chance of development through the next seven days. This would be Dexter if it does develop here in the Gulf Coast. Now, regardless of that intensification,  This is going to bring a lot of moisture with it. So we're going to see the locally heavy downpours from Florida extending through parts of the Florida Panhandle here over the course of the next couple of days. Hallie? Violetta Yoss, thank you very much. Glad you're with us, tracking all of it. Very busy day for you.

What's the rationale from the White House, from the Trump administration behind that? They think it's going to jumpstart Putin to the negotiating table?  Yeah, I think you characterize it well, Hallie, as sort of a one-two punch. You've got, on the one hand, the president giving these Patriot missiles, something that Ukraine has been asking for. Despite these missiles being out there for decades, they are still one of the most sophisticated air defense systems to help protect Ukraine from this barrage of Russian missiles that have only been increasing in recent weeks. And yes, at the same time, you have  the threat of these sanctions. Now, the president, as you noted, giving this 50-day timeline, which is kind of a long time. It was a little bit more than experts were expecting. But if there is not a deal, the president saying that he would put the so-called secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil, and that oil revenue coming from countries like China and India have been helping fuel this Russian war effort.

So it's sort of ironic, over the weekend, lobbying these 30% tariffs on Europe, accusing the country of dragging its feet and ripping them off on trade deals. So on the one hand, some more comfortable vibe shift towards Europe. On the other hand, still a really hard stance when it comes to tariffs and economic policy.  Shannon petty piece thank you and to that point to a different kind of ceasefire now a Figurative one in the trade war between the u.s. And the European Union with EU officials backing down for now after both sides traded these threats of more punishing tariffs trade reps for Europe say they're willing to negotiate a deal before this August 1st deadline the president said and this could be important for what you pay for the stuff that you want because remember the u.s. Trades more with the EU than any other country or trading block look at that nearly a trillion dollars every year so  Next 18 days of negotiating. They're gonna be really important on both sides of the Atlantic. Still this constant, like, tariff, back and forth, will he, won't he, when the deadline, etc. It seems to be shaking the world's confidence in the dollar as the global currency. You see, the value of the dollar is down about 10% since President Trump took office. And you know what that's good for?  Crypto, if you're into it, with Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $120,000 per coin, as investors look for kind of an alternative. Christine Romans is breaking it down for us tonight.  Another tariff threat and a new deadline, August 1st for this EU threat from the president. I mean, look, back in April, so-called Liberation Day, very big tariffs were threatened and then the president put those on pause. And now here we are again with the president threatening very big tariffs against this really important trading partner, you know, this block of 27 nations, Hallie.  You know, this accounts for 30 percent of global trade with the U.S. and the E.U. trade together, so not insignificant. A huge trading partner. We're talking everything from medicines to pharmaceuticals to really high-tech equipment and machinery.  to say nothing of French wine and Spanish and Italian olive oil and all these kinds of things that consumers, of course, notice firsthand. So a really big, important relationship and a lot of pressure to get something done here. You know, EU negotiators, they have the ability to, you know, retaliate, and that could hurt American farmers and American bourbon makers and brewers.  and all sorts of important products that the U.S. sends overseas as well. So really kind of a high stakes moment here. And at the same time, you have record high for NASDAQ, record high for Bitcoin, really interesting split screen here. And that might very well be that there's so much drama on the trade front that a lot of the energy is in this alternative investment in Bitcoin, record highs there.  And then also the Nasdaq doing quite well. There's the feeling that artificial intelligence is a really big driver for earnings in the tech sector and that tech has had just an amazing recovery from its April lows. There's just a lot of risk, though, right, when you talk about a dollar weakening  stocks, some stocks at record highs, Bitcoin at record highs, and all this uncertainty on the trade front. So there are quite a few people who are starting to speculate, is Wall Street getting ahead of itself given the fact that there still is uncertainty about what happens next on the trade front, Hal?  Christine Romans, thank you very much. Coming up later this hour, much more to get to, including a farmer in Oklahoma killed by some of the livestock he just bought. Plus, apparently, even a defeat cannot keep former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo down for long. Well, we've just learned about what he says on staying in the race to lead New York City.  why NFL legend John Elway will not face charges after a golf cart accident killed his former agent. That's coming up in just a minute. But first, tonight, you've got some in the Trump administration discovering you cannot put your own conspiracy theory toothpaste back in the tube. With the White House trying hard to downplay a MAGA world revolt over how the administration has handled the Jeffrey Epstein case, saying that the Justice Department and the FBI are in lockstep over the whole thing. And if you have not been in the weeds on, you know, all things Epstein in the last 48 hours, here's the deal.  You've got some of the president's most loyal supporters now calling on the Attorney General to be fired after she released, her Department of Justice released a memo last week, two pages, not signed, that said there was no evidence Epstein was murdered in 2019. He died by suicide in prison and no existence of a so-called client list of high-profile men who trafficked underage girls. Now, that contradicts what people like the head of the FBI and his number two have suggested before.  allegations of a cover-up that took off inside the MAGA movement. So now that Dan Bongino and Kash Patel are at the FBI, and now that they acknowledge there was not a cover-up, those same Trump supporters aren't buying it. Watch.  Epstein is a key that picks the lock on so many things. I will not rest until we go full Jan 6 committee on the Jeffrey Epstein files. I don't think they're telling us the truth about Epstein. Who would you guys prefer, Bongino or Bonnie?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 37, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1691.303, "text": "They want Dan."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1691.724, "text": "7,000 to 0. They want Dan.  NBC has reported, per multiple sources, that Bongino, you heard him referred to there, Dan Bongino on your left, the deputy FBI director, considered resigning over this after a heated confrontation with Pam Bondi, the attorney general. She's on the right. But the president said late yesterday he thinks Bongino's now in good shape.  I want to bring in Sahil Kapoor from Capitol Hill. The president also seems to want this over with. He is aggressively trying to get people to move past all things Epstein. He says, Bondi's doing a fantastic job. It doesn't seem like her job is at risk right now. But what is the appetite where you are for something like a special committee to investigate this, or as some have called for, a special counsel appointed on this? That's some of what we're hearing from inside MAGA World.  Yeah, Hallie, among congressional Republicans, the appetite for that is somewhere between minimal and nonexistent. Most Republicans are content to stay out of this and are not weighing in at all. And the ones who are are doing what Republicans usually do, which is simply deferring to President Trump. That includes, in the last hour or so, Senator John Thune, the majority leader. He said he's standing by Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel on this. He is deferring to the DOJ and the FBI. And he alluded to Trump's own comments. Speaker Johnson was asked about this earlier.  Also, let's play what he said.  the  That party is at this moment. Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader, spoke to reporters a couple of hours ago, said the chickens are coming home to roost from the conspiracy theories that President Trump and MAGA had spread during the campaign. He said they should give Americans the truth. Option one, as Jeffries put it, they lied for years. Option two, they're engaging in a cover-up.  He's inviting them to point to a potential option three here, though he doesn't think there is one. Now, Trump, for his part, is, on Truth Social, encouraging his supporters to move on from this. He said, let's not waste time and energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about. He also says that the files now were written by predecessors, like President Obama, as well as, somehow, Hillary Clinton. His own supporters, Hallie, don't seem to be buying this. If you scroll through the comments that  Trump is getting on Truth Social, they're not good. It's a rare instance where Trump's own supporters are angry with him, not buying his explanations, and he's getting ratioed on his own social media platform.  I think that was like the first time that that has ever happened. So if the positioning of the White House tonight and the administration tonight is that, hey, one big happy family, is that the reality? In other words, did Dan Bongino show up to work today? Is he still on his job at the end of the week? Attorney General Pam Bondi seems like she will be based on the show of support from President Trump. What's your sense of that?  Yeah, Bondi and Trump are on the same page here. I think a lot of MAGA influencers are doing what they often do, which is trying to find a scapegoat to blame, suggesting that Trump was being wronged rather than the one making the decisions. But the fact that he's aligned with Bondi, that he's defending her, and that she seems to be doing what he wants to do, I think is the key here. Now, Dan Bongino  has no particular base of support necessarily on Capitol Hill the way Bondi does. Bondi was confirmed by every Senate Republican, but Bongino was not confirmed by the Senate. So I think the senators here on the Republican side have a greater attachment to Bondi.  Sahil Kapoor, thank you very much for that. Let's get you over to the five things our team thinks you should know about tonight. Number one, we're now learning the identity of the Kentucky gunman accused of killing two women, hurting several others in Lexington in the last 24 hours. Police say Guy House shot a state trooper after he was pulled over near an airport. He then fled to a church nearby where he shot four people and killed two of them. Police officers shot and killed him at the scene.  Number two, an Oklahoma farmer is dead tonight after his two water buffaloes attacked him just a day after he bought the pair at an auction. First responders say they couldn't even get to the farmer right when they got here because of how aggressive the animals were being. He was pronounced dead on the scene.  Number three, NFL Hall of Famer John Elway will not face charges in the golf cart accident that killed his former agent. Remember, Elway was driving his business partner around. When something happened, he fell out, he died. Investigators ruled it a tragic accident. Elway's lawyer tells NBC, we're quoting here, we always knew John had done nothing wrong, but that doesn't lessen the sadness associated with this situation.  Number four, some violent confrontations in Madrid between far-right groups and migrants after an older person was beat up there. Not clear what the motive was, but far-right groups say they want retribution against the city's large migrant population. Police have arrested at least eight people over the clashes so far.  Number five, Beyonce's choreographer and one of her dancers say somebody broke into their car in Atlanta and stole some of her unreleased music. They took some hard drives apparently, some future set lists as well for her Cowboy Carter tour, which she's on right now. That's why she's in Atlanta. Police put out a warrant for the person's arrest, but they have not caught the suspect yet. Reps for Beyonce did not immediately respond to our request for comment.  Still to come here on the show, Tesla on trial, facing a jury for the first time ever over a death connected to its self-driving cars. We've got the latest on how that went today. Plus, some pretty wild video of a paraglider crash. You're going to have to see it to believe it. Hang on.  For the first time ever, a jury is set to decide the fate of a case Tesla's involved in over a death connected to its self-driving car technology. Back in 2019, in the Florida Keys, a Tesla driving on autopilot hit and killed a young woman and badly hurt her boyfriend. A lot has happened since then. Tesla initially recalled its autopilot feature after the accident. You're seeing some of the footage from police there.  The company says it's had a ton of updates and improvements in the last few years. But this is still kind of a watershed moment because this trial could set the tone for whether car makers can be held responsible for crashes involving their self-driving cars. NBC's George Solis is tracking this one for us today. There is certainly potentially a ripple effect here because so far Tesla has been able to either settle or get dismissed. Other lawsuits like this one, this is the first time that they're actually facing a jury. So what's their main argument here?  Yeah, Hallie said this could be significant and landmark case. Essentially, Tesla's lawyers here arguing that the person behind the crash here was at fault simply because they were distracted. As you mentioned, this all goes back to that 2019 case. This driver saying that he was essentially turning on the autopilot and then went down to look for his phone. And before he knew it, he had slammed into an SUV. Unfortunately, that ripple effect of that SUV being hit  a woman killing her and her boyfriend was seriously injured. The family brought forth a lawsuit and some reporting that we have seen is that the driver of the Tesla actually settled with this family. So this is again at the center of all of this is whether or not this autopilot feature is to blame and Tesla's attorneys putting out a statement saying again this is all related to that driver being distracted and that they're  autonomous feature is meant for someone to actually have both hands on the wheel. It's not meant for someone to basically be distracted in their words. And so we saw a jury seated today, Hallie. Six women, three men in the opening arguments also concluding today or starting today, I should say.  Can you pull on the thread a little bit more of what this could mean for other companies as well? Because automated driving, I mean, this is, we've been talking about this technology. It is getting more and more widespread. Company, you know, there's other companies that are getting involved in this for cars that you can, you know, pull up on an app even if you don't own them. So there's a lot of eyeballs. There's a huge spotlight on what's happening in this trial today.  Yeah, that's right, Allie. And it's something we've talked about here on this show before. I mean, Tesla itself, of course, just unveiling its test market for those robo taxis in Austin, right? A case like this could obviously have some implications on how much further that blueprint could grow and for other companies that are trying to do the same. So it's certainly a case that's going to be worth watching. Allie?  George Solis, thank you very much for that.  Out of our Northeast Bureau, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is making it officially official. He's staying in the New York City mayor's race as an independent. That's after he lost the Democratic primary to Zora Mundani just last month. Cuomo, in a post online late today, says in his words, he's in it to win it. Out of our Midwest Bureau, take a look at this. The moment a paraglider crashed in North Dakota right into some power lines. Look at this.  Whoa! Oh no! Oh jeez!  Oh, geez. Yeah, you can see them. They fall right into the river. Fortunately, nothing actually caught on fire. Nobody was seriously hurt. Everybody walked away from that just fine. Thank goodness. Out of our Northeast Bureau, trash pickup is back on in Philly for the first time in two weeks, just about, as the City Workers Union is now voting on a new contract that would give them more money, a 9% raise over the next few years. We'll see the results from that vote this time next week. But in the meantime, as you can see, they are getting the trash off the streets.  Also tonight, a new report out today shows the number of kids getting sick from nicotine products skyrocketing. That includes the deaths of two children, boys under the age of two, who died after ingesting, after swallowing the liquid nicotine that people use in vapes. But it's nicotine pouches, like very popular Zin pouches, that are apparently driving this rise in accidental nicotine poisonings among little kids.  Erica Edwards is joining us now. Tell us more, Erica, about what this study found. Why is it so dangerous? Is it because it's sort of around in more households now?  Hey, Hallie. Yeah, you know, nicotine poisonings among little kids under age six have actually been growing since 2010, but it was really once the pandemic hit in 2020 when daycare schools were closed, there was lockdown, kids were more likely to be at home, that these nicotine poisonings really started to skyrocket. In fact, between 2020 and 2023, those poisonings rose by 763%. Now, nicotine is a toxin, right? It's a chemical.  And there's no safe amount known for young kids. In adults, it increases the heart rate and blood pressure. In extreme cases, it can lead to vomiting, even coma. That's in adults, Hallie. Think about what that can do to a tiny body. Now, the makers of Zyn, as you mentioned here in the intro, did give us a statement today saying that Zyn is the only nicotine pouch authorized by the FDA as appropriate to protect public health. In making that conclusion, the agency noted that Zyn's packaging  is designed to be child-resistant. However, experts say, listen, no matter what packaging it's in, keep those products up out of those little kids' hands. How would a parent know if their kid accidentally, if they weren't around, their kid somehow got their hands on something like this, how would they know that that is what their child is sick from?  So one of the most important signs of nicotine poisoning is trouble breathing and seizures. If you have one of these nicotine pouches in your purse, you've left it on the floor, you see that a child has gotten into it. The most important thing to do is to call the National Poison Control Center. That number is  1-800-222-1222. Now, Hallie, there's no reason to memorize this, right? Experts say save that number in your phone as one of your favorite contacts, right? So you can access it just as quickly as you can. Your spouse, your partner, your mom, your best friend. Have that saved in your contacts quickly so that you can access it if something like this happens. Hallie. Erica Edwards, glad to have you with us on that important story. Appreciate it. Coming up.  Our teams sit down with the family of one of the University of Idaho students killed in an attack that horrified the country. What they say about that shocking plea deal for Brian Kober. Next. It's not like he's gonna, they're gonna put him in the chair and have him testify about why. I don't believe that we will ever learn that.  Tonight, the parents of one of the four college students brutally murdered in 2022 tell NBC News taking their son's killer to trial would not have given them any more clarity than they already have. Here's their exclusive interview, the parents of Ethan Chapin with our Liz Kreutz. I mean, it's not like he's gonna, they're gonna put him in the chair and have him testify about why. I don't believe that we will ever learn that. And I don't need to know. It doesn't change the outcome.  Their son, Ethan, was one of the four students stabbed to death by Brian Koberger, along with Chapin's girlfriend, Zanna Kernodl, and her housemates, Madison Mogan and Kaley Gonsalves. There's been some pushback, including from the family of one of Koberger's other victims, after he agreed to a plea deal earlier this month that helped him avoid trial and a potential death sentence. That deal, that plea deal, was a shocker. He's now set to be sentenced for the murders next week.  Yasmin Vesugian is joining us now. And Yas, the Chapin's seemed pretty certain that they would not get the answers that they would have wanted either way. Here's a little bit more of Liz's conversation with them. It's a horrific event. We've gotten through it. I mean, as best as we can, as we continue to heal every single day. And yeah, it's just, no, it doesn't get any more time. It doesn't get any more time.  It sounds like closure was particularly important to them as far as they could get, you know, as close to it as they could get. Yeah. I mean, listen, Liz did an incredible job in that interview. And I think, you know, it shows just how painful, obviously, this entire time has been for that family and the victims' families.  throughout this situation after the murder of their children. But they talk about how, listen, Ethan Chapin was one of triplets, and they certainly didn't want their other children called to the stand who have now graduated from the University of Idaho. They didn't want the gruesome details to be brought up in court to relive, rehash,  all of the things they have already gone through in learning that their son was killed. They wanted to focus now on the family that they have and their relationship as well. And in order to do that, they wanted to move on from this trial, hence why they felt as if it was the best decision. They did not want to hear from Brian Koberger any further. Let's take a little bit more of a listen to both of them speaking with Liz, and then we'll talk, Hal, on the other side. It was actually Jim who was like, we just need to make a pact from this day forward.  Yeah, for our kids, for our relationship, you know. And whatever we have to endure, we'll endure it together."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 39, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2617.108, "text": "You know, because everything, honestly, everything we've ever done with our kids and stuff is positive. And we try to push that on them and live their life that way. So we just always just took the high road."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 40, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2629.375, "text": " And listen, since then, Hal, you've got to give these people a lot of credit, this family a lot of credit. I mean, imagine the nightmare they have already lived through. And they've set up this beautiful foundation, Ethan's Smile, in which they're providing educational funding to various kids that they feel as if  deserve it. They want to focus on the positive coming out of this thing versus the negative and the murder of their son. But you also mentioned, Hal, coming into this, that some families did not necessarily agree with the decision for Brian Kober to strike this plea deal for life sentences. And Steven Gonsalves is one of them, Kayleigh's father, in which he said Idaho has, quote unquote, failed. And so it is not kind of a unanimous  decision here and or reaction, but nonetheless certain families certainly are happy to move on from this. But we may hear all of that spectrum, Yaz, when the sentencing happens for Brian Koberger on July 23rd, because there may be an opportunity to hear from all these families, right?  Yeah, exactly. But Ethan Chapin's parents in that interview with Liz Creutz said they're not going to be there on the sentencing day for Brian Koberger because they want to be with their family, enjoying the day, looking ahead and not rehashing what has already come to be. But certainly this will be an opportunity for, as you said, closure, any sort of closure that you can actually have after the murder of your children at the sentencing on July 23rd for Brian Koberger.  Yasmin Vesugian, thank you very much for bringing us that reporting. Thanks to Liz, too, for that interview. Appreciate it. Still to come here on the show, much more, including what your favorite Sesame Street character is saying tonight after somebody hacked up a hateful store. It's tonight's Original Now with in-depth reporting on a topic we've been watching. And tonight, it's the unknown hacker who took over Elmo's account this weekend. Yes, that Elmo.  posting a series of hateful and anti-Semitic things which were deleted pretty quickly. All of it with public media already under the microscope this week now that the Senate is expected to vote on whether or not to claw back a big chunk of federal money. Our Mel Zinona has the story. Sesame Street scrambling to do damage control today.  after Elmo's ex got hacked this weekend. The account of America's favorite furry red monster shocking its half a million plus followers with a string of posts, not only making anti-Semitic and racist comments, but also a derogatory reference to President Trump in connection to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.  according to the Associated Press. NBC News did not independently review the post before they were deleted. Sesame Workshop, the non-profit behind Elmo and Sesame Street, confirming to NBC News the account was hacked, calling the post, quote, disgusting, and adding they're working to restore full control of the account. Needless to say, the post's not on brand for the friendly Muppet.  It's really important to respect everybody. Elmo going viral last year, inadvertently starting a mental health campaign when he tweeted, how's everybody doing? And Elmo's glad that he got to talk to a lot of people. Now, after the hack, Senator Mike Lee posting, I'm forever scarred by Elmo, words I never expected to utter. Democrat Representative Jared Moskowitz trying to turn attention to a different controversy facing public broadcaster, posting, see what happens when you defund PBS?  The Senate is expected to vote this week on whether to take back $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds both NPR and PBS. Trump demanding Republicans defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or risk losing his endorsement. The executive order pushing for the cuts said NPR and PBS provide biased and partisan news coverage.  The heads of those organizations pushing back with NPR's chief executive. Also emphasizing that people relying on independent local stations, especially in rural regions, will feel the impact immediately."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 41, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 2861.141, "text": "Good afternoon."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 42, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2862.163, "text": "Senate Minority Leader Schumer threatening a shutdown if Republicans quote cave to the president's demands."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 43, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 2868.133, "text": "It is not okay.

Well, Trump is really putting pressure on Congress to get this bill to his desk, even threatening political retribution for those who stand in his way. So we could start to see the first votes in this process kick off as soon as tomorrow, potentially Wednesday, still TBD. But there are still Republicans who have serious issues with these spending cuts. You have some Republicans, like Susan Collins, for example. She has issues with the cuts to foreign aid and critical anti-HIV-AIDS programs like PEPFAR.  And then you have other Republicans who, yes, are concerned about these cuts to PBS and NPR, which they say are critical for providing not only news but also things like weather alerts into rural areas, something that is obviously top of mind after those devastating floods in Texas last week. So the Senate could make some changes to this bill over the next few days. If they do that, though, Hallie, then they need to send it back to the House in order to send it to Trump's desk. So the time is ticking here, though, because they have to act  by July 19th in order to unlock this special process to avoid using Democratic votes in the Senate, Hallie. Melanie Zinona, plenty busy on your beat again this week. Thank you very much. That is a wrap for this hour. Thank you as always for watching. We've got a lot more coverage picking up right now.  We are coming on the air tonight with extreme weather, coast to coast to coast. A race against time to stop wildfires at the Grand Canyon and the fight against rising rivers in rain-soaked Texas. Out east, flights and travel already affected as all eyes turn to the Gulf Coast, where a tropical system could slam the South. We've got it all covered.  And the investigation into the deadly fire that killed nine people at a nursing home. My firefighters say more lives could have been saved. Plus, President Trump trying to tamp down the backlash from his own base, defending his team's handling of the Epstein case. But is it enough? And whose jobs are on the line? Plus, a new study shows nicotine poisoning is on the rise for little kids. What you need to watch for to keep your family safe.  Then Tesla facing a jury trial for the first time ever over a deadly autopilot crash. The threat to Tesla's reputation and the potential ripple effect on the car industry writ large a little bit later in the show.  Hey, I'm Hallie, and tonight we are on the ground with extreme storms and intense fires in some key spots, including the iconic Grand Canyon National Park, where crews are racing to get a handle on two wildfires right along the North Rim. Neither of them are contained. They're both at 0% even tonight. And look at this. You can see they're ripping through the forests near the Grand Canyon. You see the flames. You see the smoke. They've exploded in size, or one of them has, doubling from 20,000 to 40,000 acres overnight.  People have had to be evacuated with this whole thing, throwing a wrench into tourist season. Some parts of the park are closed for now. If there is good news, it is that so far we have no reports of anybody getting hurt, but a lot of buildings have been damaged, including the iconic, historic Grand Canyon Lodge. Down in Central Texas, meantime, you've got torrential rain hitting an already decimated part of the state, where you've got first responders out today still looking for the bodies of the more than 100-plus people still reported to be missing.  It comes as new tonight, we're hearing more of these devastating stories out of Camp Mystic. With one mother telling People Magazine she received a letter from her eight-year-old daughter that arrived even after the family learned the little girl had died in the flooding. Telling her camp was amazing.  Up and down the East Coast, you've got severe thunderstorms causing ground stops and delays at multiple big airports. And the National Hurricane Center is watching the Gulf right now for a potential tropical system. We've got a lot to get to. We'll have more with meteorologist Violet Ayas and Morgan Chesky in just a second. But I want to start with Steve Patterson, who has made his way to Grand Canyon National Park.

Yeah, Hallie, as far as communications with the camps, that's still very much one of the big questions here that I think authorities are trying to figure out as well. That state representative told me that he has been in contact with multiple camps and it appears, at least early on, that the only way they had to communicate with authorities as that storm moved in, as those floodwaters rose, were cell phones."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 75, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 3646.516, "text": " adding that, unfortunately, cell service was at least temporarily knocked out when that river surged down from the headwaters to Hunt and then to Kerrville."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 76, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 3657.791, "text": "One of the things that we've been hearing as well is that when people were stranded by those floodwaters up and down the river, they weren't able to communicate. And that is why, going forward, there is a lot of discussion already about  how to improve that service, whether emergency comms, such as satellite phones, or anything of that nature can be fully explored here, Hallie. I think one of the frustrating parts is that there are still a lot of unknowns at this point in time that people are hoping to find out sooner than later, especially when that special session starts come soon. Hallie.  Morgan, I can see that it looks, if not sunny, at least it's not pouring rain behind you here. We know that there are more than 100 plus people whose bodies have still not been recovered in the state of Texas around the state after the July 4th flooding. Has the recovery been able to resume today? Have you seen crews out there actively? Is that happening?  Yeah, Hallie, we have seen crews, dive crews as well, going into the water. Although I should add that it is still high right now because we had a lot of rain overnight. We know that if not here in Kerrville, there have been flood watches issued across much of the hill country.  And so there is certainly a tension being felt right now. We're not anticipating the kind of rain that, of course, led to this disaster. But even a little bit, Hallie, that can get these crews out of the water is just slowing down this ongoing search for, as you mentioned, so many people still missing. Hallie. Morgan Chesky, live for us there in Kerrville. Morgan, thank you.  And while we are watching, of course, the aftermath of those devastating Texas floods, we're also keeping an eye on the system developing in the Gulf and the storms out east with some big cities dealing with some dangerous flash flood potential tonight, all as this system is making its way toward the southeast. I want to bring in WNBC's Violetta Yaz, who's joining us now. Good to see you. Talk us through this double whammy for both the Mid-Atlantic and the Gulf Coast here.  Hey Hallie, yeah, conditions are deteriorating pretty quickly. Unfortunately, across the Northeast, we've got torrential slow moving downpours right now impacting really especially Pennsylvania, New Jersey and parts of New York State. You can see we've got numerous flash flood warnings in effect. We're already seeing.  reports of some road closures of cars being stuck in certain locations. And unfortunately, this is just the beginning of it, as we still have sort of the back end of this slug of rain that's going to push to the north and east. So that's why our flood alerts remain in effect through this evening, with 46 million people impacted. I think the timing of this makes it especially dangerous, right? We've got plenty of people on the roads during rush hour.  this moving into the I-95 corridor. So we're expecting very, unfortunately, dangerous conditions here with flooding expected through this evening, along with those very heavy downpours. Again, we've got airport delays happening all along that I-95 corridor from Washington and Baltimore through Philadelphia and up to the New York City area. And that's gonna be sort of the bullseye of our flash flood risk as we head into this evening, right around D.C., up through the New York City area as well. The rainfall forecast through tomorrow  a general inch or so with locally higher amounts of anywhere from 3 to 5 inches in those heavier downpours. So we're talking very dangerous conditions as we head into this evening. If you don't need to be on the roads, you definitely don't want to head out right now. And as you mentioned, we're keeping an eye on potential tropical development through the next couple of days. If this does develop, it would be Dexter at least through the next seven days. Hallie.  Violetta Yaz, thank you very much for that. Appreciate it.

Well, to your point, this investigation still in the very early stages, but investigators revealing tonight that they do not believe the cause of this fire that swept through the senior living facility behind me was suspicious in nature.

President Trump back here in Washington putting Vladimir Putin on notice tonight, threatening tough tariffs if the Kremlin doesn't get to a deal to end its war in Ukraine in the next 50 days. So that's like an end of summer timeline. And that's part one of a one-two punch, as the president's also announcing a deal to get defensive weapons to Ukraine, weapons they really need.

So setting aside sort of the interesting factoid that the President shared there, that the First Lady is in some ways keeping him abreast of what's going on, of course, in Ukraine after the invasion of Russia there, the Patriot missile system, important to Ukraine. Worth noting, it is a defensive weapon system, not offensive, and that matters. And then there's this 50-day timeline. How realistic is it?  Well, I mean, on those Patriot missiles, this is something Ukraine has been asking for over and over again, more air defense to protect its cities, its infrastructure from this increasing onslaught of Russian missiles and drones that have been coming in. So a crucial thing that Ukraine has been seeking. On the sanctions, those would really go after, at least the intention is to go after Russia's oil exports.  exports, which have been helping fuel this war and helping finance it. Oil is obviously a huge part of the revenue source for Russia. And a lot of the buyers of that oil are China and India. So they would be directly hit by these sanctions being put in place. So a double strategy here. Of course, I'll note this is not the first president to try and use sanctions economically as a way to leverage  countries, oftentimes with real little results at the end of the day. There are a number of economic sanctions already on Russia, and yet this war has continued on.  Shannon, the other piece of this, too, is the way that the president is talking about Vladimir Putin and a very notable shift here. We're both old enough to remember, I remember being on, I think, foreign trips with you at one point in the first term. The president spoke very, very favorably about Vladimir Putin.

Shannon Pettypiece, outside what appears to be a rainy White House tonight. Shannon, thank you very much.  Now to a different kind of ceasefire, a figurative one in the trade war between the US and the European Union, with the EU backing down for now after both sides traded threats of more punishing tariffs. Trade reps for Europe say they're willing to negotiate a deal before the president's August 1st deadline. That's what's in place. And, look, this could be important for the stuff that you pay.  that you need, because the US trades more with the EU than any other trading bloc or country. You see it here in nearly a trillion dollars. So the next 18 days are going to be critical. This constant tariff back and forth, however, the constant questions around it, shifting timelines, et cetera, seems to be shaking the world's confidence in the dollar as the global currency. You see the value of the dollar is down about 10% since President Trump took office. So who wins in that situation?  Crypto? Bitcoin? Look, hitting an all-time high of $120,000 a coin as investors look to find some kind of an alternative. Christine Romans is breaking it down for us tonight.  Another tariff threat and a new deadline, August 1st for this EU threat from the President. I mean, look, back in April, so-called Liberation Day, very big tariffs were threatened and then the President put those on pause. And now here we are again with the President threatening very big tariffs against this really important trading partner, you know, this block of 27 nations, Hallie.  You know, this accounts for 30 percent of global trade with the U.S. and the E.U. trade together, so not insignificant. A huge trading partner. We're talking everything from medicines to pharmaceuticals to really high-tech equipment and machinery.  to say nothing of French wine and Spanish and Italian olive oil and all these kinds of things that consumers, of course, notice firsthand. So a really big, important relationship and a lot of pressure to get something done here. You know, EU negotiators, they have the ability to, you know, retaliate. And that could hurt American farmers and American bourbon makers and brewers and all  all sorts of important products that the US sends overseas as well. So really kind of a high stakes moment here. And at the same time, you have record high for NASDAQ, record high for Bitcoin, really interesting split screen here. And that might very well be that there's so much drama on the trade front that a lot of the energy is in this alternative investment in Bitcoin, record highs there.  And then also the Nasdaq doing quite well. There's the feeling that artificial intelligence is a really big driver for earnings in the tech sector and that tech has had just an amazing recovery from its April lows. There's just a lot of risk, though, right, when you talk about a dollar weakening.  some stocks at record highs, Bitcoin at record highs, and all this uncertainty on the trade front. So there are quite a few people who are starting to speculate, hmm, is Wall Street getting ahead of itself given the fact that there still is uncertainty about what happens next on the trade front, Hal?  Christine Romans, thank you very much. Much more to get to here on the show, including what some thieves took from Queen Bee's team during Beyonce's Cowboy Carter tour stop. Plus, the historic mission wrapping up in space. We'll tell you when a group of astronauts are going to land back Earth side next.  Let's get you over to the five things our team thinks you should know about tonight. Number one, four people are dead after a small plane crashed while taking off from a London airport. It went down not long after takeoff, bursting into flames. British investigators are still looking into this. Number two, the head of the healthcare facility where an oxygen chamber exploded and killed a five-year-old, in court today. A fire started inside that hyperbaric chamber while the boy was getting treatment inside. The judge is now granting the owner's request to return to the facility to help oversee its sale.  The CEO is charged in the little boy's death. Three other workers are also facing charges, all pleading not guilty. Number three, 24 states and D.C. are now suing the White House for freezing $7 billion in money meant for education just a day before schools were supposed to get the money. Now, Congress already allocated this funding for stuff like teacher trainings, after-school programs. The Trump administration says it's reviewing all of it to make sure the spending aligns with the president's priorities.  Number four, apparently some new unreleased Beyonce music has been stolen. Her choreographer and one of her dancers say thieves broke into their car in Atlanta and took hard drives with some of the music on it. The hard drives also had future set lists for Beyonce's tour. She's on this Cowboy Carter tour. That's why she's in Atlanta. Police have a warrant out for this suspect's arrest, but they haven't caught him yet. Reps for Beyonce did not immediately respond to our request for comment.  Number five, astronauts from India, Poland, Hungary are all coming back down to Earth after wrapping up a private mission to the International Space Station. These astronauts were the first from their home countries to visit the ISS, marking the first time in more than 40 years that these countries sent one of their own rockets into orbit. They're expected to splash down in California tomorrow morning.  So, tonight, you've got some in the Trump administration learning it's pretty tricky to put your own conspiracy theory toothpaste back in the tube, with the White House trying hard to downplay a nag-a-world revolt over how the administration's handled the Jeffrey Epstein case, saying the Justice Department, the FBI are in lockstep over the whole thing.  all as Democrats try to take advantage of the moment. Now, listen, if you haven't been in the weeds over all this, over, like, all things Epstein in the last two days, here's the deal. Some of the president's most loyal supporters now want the attorney general to be fired after the DOJ put out a memo last week that said there was no evidence that Epstein was murdered in 2019, he died by suicide in prison, and no existence of a so-called client list of men who trafficked underage girls.  Now, that seems to contradict what people like the head of the FBI and his number two have suggested before. Allegations of a cover-up that took off inside the MAGA movement. But now that Dan Bongino and Kash Patel are at the FBI, and now that they acknowledge there was not a cover-up, that's done, right? That's put to bed? Not so much. You've got the same Trump supporters who were part of this whole discussion who aren't buying the new line.  Epstein is a key that picks the lock on so many things. I will not rest until we go full Jan 6 committee on the Jeffrey Epstein files. I don't think they're telling us the truth about Epstein.

He is aggressively trying to get people to move past all things Epstein. He says, Bondi's doing a fantastic job. It doesn't seem like her job is at risk right now. But what is the appetite where you are for something like a special committee to investigate this, or as some have called for, a special counsel appointed on this? That's some of what we're hearing from inside MAGA World.  Yeah, Hallie, among congressional Republicans, the appetite for that is somewhere between minimal and non-existent. Most Republicans are content to stay out of this and are not weighing in at all. And the ones who are, are doing what Republicans usually do, which is simply deferring to President Trump. That includes, in the last hour or so, Senator John Thune, the majority leader. He said he's standing by Bondi and FBI Director Cash Patel on this.  He is deferring to the DOJ and the FBI, and he alluded to Trump's own comments. Speaker Johnson was asked about this earlier."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 94, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 4782.281, "text": "Also, let's play what he said."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 95, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 4798.032, "text": " How many  That party is at this moment. Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader, spoke to reporters a couple of hours ago, said the chickens are coming home to roost from the conspiracy theories that President Trump and MAGA had spread during the campaign. He said they should give Americans the truth. Option one, as Jeffries put it, they lied for years. Option two, they're engaging in a cover-up. He's inviting them to, you know, to point to a potential option three here, though he doesn't think there is one. Now, Trump, for his part, is  on Truth Social, encouraging his supporters to move on from this. He said, let's not waste time and energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about. He also says that the files now were written by predecessors like President Obama, as well as somehow Hillary Clinton. His own supporters, Hallie, don't seem to be buying this. If you scroll through the comments that  Trump is getting on truth social. They're not good. It's a rare instance where Trump's own supporters are angry with him not buying his explanations And he's getting ratioed on his own social media platform  I think that was like the first time that that has ever happened. So if the positioning of the White House tonight and the administration is that, hey, one big happy family, is that the reality? In other words, did Dan Bongino show up to work today? Is he still on his job at the end of the week? Attorney General Pam Bondi seems like she will be based on the show of support from President Trump. What's your sense of that?  Yeah, Bondi and Trump are on the same page here. I think a lot of MAGA influencers are doing what they often do, which is trying to find a scapegoat to blame, suggesting that Trump was being wronged rather than the one making the decisions. But the fact that he's aligned with Bondi, that he's defending her, and that she seems to be doing what he wants to do, I think is the key here.  has no particular, you know, base of support necessarily on Capitol Hill the way Bondi does. Bondi was confirmed by every Senate Republican, but Bongino was not confirmed by the Senate. So I think the senators here on the Republican side have a better, a greater attachment to Bondi.  Sahil Kapoor, thank you very much for that.  For the first time ever, a jury is set to decide the fate of a case Tesla's involved in over a death connected to its self-driving car technology. Back in 2019 in the Florida Keys, a Tesla driving on autopilot hit and killed a young woman and badly hurt her boyfriend. A lot has happened since then. Tesla initially recalled its autopilot feature after the accident. You're seeing some of the footage from police there.  The company says it's had a ton of updates and improvements in the last few years. But this is still kind of a watershed moment because this trial could set the tone for whether car makers can be held responsible for crashes involving their self-driving cars. NBC's George Solis is tracking this one for us today. There is certainly potentially a ripple effect here because so far Tesla has been able to either settle or get dismissed. Other lawsuits like this one, this is the first time that they're actually facing a jury. So what's their main argument here?  Yeah, Hallie said this could be a significant and landmark case. Essentially, Tesla's lawyers here arguing that the person behind the crash here was at fault simply because they were distracted. As you mentioned, this all goes back to that 2019 case, this driver saying that he was essentially turning on the autopilot and then went down to look for his phone. And before he knew it, he had slammed into an SUV. Unfortunately, that ripple effect of that SUV being hit  a woman killing her and her boyfriend was seriously injured. The family brought forth a lawsuit and some reporting that we have seen is that the driver of the Tesla actually settled with this family. So this is again at the center of all of this is whether or not this autopilot feature is to blame and Tesla's attorneys putting out a statement saying again this is all  related to that driver being distracted and that their autonomous feature is meant for someone to actually have both hands on the wheel. It's not meant for someone to basically be distracted in their words. And so we saw a jury seated today, Hallie. Six women, three men in the opening arguments also concluding today or starting today, I should say.  Can you pull on the thread a little bit more of what this could mean for other companies as well? Because automated driving, I mean, this is, we've been talking about this technology. It is getting more and more widespread. Company, you know, there's other companies that are getting involved in this for cars that you can, you know, pull up on an app even if you don't own them. So there's a lot of eyeballs. There's a huge spotlight on what's happening in this trial today.  Yeah, that's right, Hallie. And it's something we've talked about here on this show before. I mean, Tesla itself, of course, just unveiling its test market for those robo taxis in Austin, right? A case like this could obviously have some implications on how much further that blueprint could grow and for other companies that are trying to do the same. So it's certainly a case that's going to be worth watching. Hallie.  George Solis, thank you very much for that.  Out of our Northeast Bureau, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is making it officially official. He's staying in the New York City mayor's race as an independent. That's after he lost the Democratic primary to Zora Mandani just last month. Cuomo, in a post online late today, says in his words, he's in it to win it. Out of our Midwest Bureau, take a look at this. The moment a paraglider crashed in North Dakota right into some power lines. Look at this.  Whoa! Oh no! Oh jeez!  Oh, geez. Yeah, you can see them. They fall right into the river. Fortunately, nothing actually caught on fire. Nobody was seriously hurt. Everybody walked away from that just fine. Thank goodness. At our Northeast Bureau, trash pickup is back on in Philly for the first time in two weeks, just about, as the City Workers Union is now voting on a new contract that would give them more money, a 9% raise over the next few years. We'll see the results from that vote this time next week. But in the meantime, as you can see, they are getting the trash off the streets.  Also tonight, a new report out today shows the number of kids getting sick from nicotine products skyrocketing. That includes the deaths of two children, boys under the age of two, who died after ingesting, after swallowing the liquid nicotine that people use in vapes. But it's nicotine pouches, like very popular Zin pouches, that are apparently driving this rise in accidental nicotine poisonings among little kids.  Erica Edwards is joining us now. Tell us more, Erica, about what this study found. Why is it so dangerous? Is it because it's sort of around in more households now?  Hey, Hallie. Yeah, you know, nicotine poisonings among little kids under age six have actually been growing since 2010, but it was really once the pandemic hit in 2020, when daycare schools were closed, there was lockdown, kids were more likely to be at home, that these nicotine poisonings really started to skyrocket. In fact, between 2020 and 2023, those poisonings rose by 763%. Now, nicotine is a toxin, right? It's a chemical.  And there's no safe amount known for young kids. In adults, it increases the heart rate and blood pressure. In extreme cases, it can lead to vomiting, even coma. That's in adults, Hallie. Think about what that can do to a tiny body. Now, the makers of Zyn, as you mentioned here in the intro, did give us a statement today saying that Zyn is the only nicotine pouch authorized by the FDA as appropriate to protect public health. In making that conclusion, the agency noted that Zyn's packaging  is designed to be child-resistant. However, experts say, listen, no matter what packaging it's in, keep those products up out of those little kids' hands. How would a parent know if their kid accidentally, if they weren't around, their kid somehow got their hands on something like this, how would they know that that is what their child is sick from?  So one of the most important signs of nicotine poisoning is trouble breathing and seizures. If you have one of these nicotine pouches in your purse, you've left it on the floor, you see that a child has gotten into it, the most important thing to do is to call the National Poison Control Center. That number is 1-800-222-1800.  Now, Hallie, there's no reason to memorize this, right? Experts say save that number in your phone as one of your favorite contacts, right? So you can access it just as quickly as you can. Your spouse, your partner, your mom, your best friend. Have that saved in your contacts quickly so that you can access it if something like this happens. Hallie. Erica Edwards, glad to have you with us on that important story. Appreciate it.  Coming up, our teams sit down with the family of one of the University of Idaho students killed in an attack that horrified the country. What they say about that shocking plea deal for Brian Koberger, next. It's not like he's going to, they're going to put him in the chair and have him testify about why. I don't believe that we will ever learn that.  Tonight, the parents of one of the four college students brutally murdered in 2022 tell NBC News taking their son's killer to trial would not have given them any more clarity than they already have. Here's their exclusive interview, the parents of Ethan Chapin with our Liz Kreutz. I mean, it's not like he's gonna, they're gonna put him in the chair and have him testify about why. I don't believe that we will ever learn that. And I don't need to know. It doesn't change the outcome.  Their son, Ethan, was one of the four students stabbed to death by Brian Koberger, along with Chapin's girlfriend, Zana Kernodle, and her housemates, Madison Mogan and Kaylee Gonsalves. There's been some pushback, including from the family of one of Koberger's other victims, after he agreed to a plea deal earlier this month that helped him avoid trial and a potential death sentence. That deal, that plea deal, was a shocker. He's now set to be sentenced for the murders next week.  Yasmin Vesugian is joining us now. And Yas, you know, the Chapin's seemed pretty certain that they would not get the answers that they would have wanted either way. Here's a little bit more of Liz's conversation with them. It's a horrific event. We've gotten through it. I mean, as best as we can, as we continue to heal every single day. And yeah, it's just, no, he doesn't, it doesn't get any more time. He doesn't get any more time.  It sounds like closure was particularly important to them as far as they could get, you know, as close to it as they could get. Yeah. I mean, listen, Liz did an incredible job in that interview. And I think, you know, it shows just how painful, obviously, this entire time has been for that family and the victims' families throughout this situation after the murder of their children.  But they talk about how, listen, Ethan Chapin was one of triplets and they certainly didn't want their other children called to the stand who have now graduated from the University of Idaho. They didn't want the gruesome details to be brought up in court to relive, rehash.  all of the things they have already gone through in learning that their son was killed. They wanted to focus now on the family that they have and their relationship as well. And in order to do that, they wanted to move on from this trial, hence why they felt as if it was the best decision. They did not want to hear from Brian Koberger any further. Let's take a little bit more of a listen to both of them speaking with Liz, and then we'll talk, Hal, on the other side. It was actually Jim who was like, we just need to make a pact from this day forward.  Yeah, for our kids, for our relationship, you know. And whatever we have to endure, we'll endure it together."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 96, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 5534.804, "text": "You know, because everything, honestly, everything we've ever done with our kids and stuff is positive.

So we just, we just always just took the high road."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 97, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 5548.092, "text": " And listen, since then, Hal, you've got to give these people a lot of credit, this family a lot of credit. I mean, imagine the nightmare they have already lived through. And they've set up this beautiful foundation, Ethan's Smile, in which they're providing educational funding to various kids that they feel as if  deserve it. They want to focus on the positive coming out of this thing versus the negative and the murder of their son. But you also mentioned how, coming into this, that some families did not necessarily agree with the decision for Brian Koberger to strike this plea deal for life sentences. And Steven Gonsalves is one of them, Kayleigh's father, in which he said Idaho has, quote-unquote, failed. And so it is not kind of a unanimous  decision here and or reaction but nonetheless certain families certainly are happy to move on from this. But we may hear all of that spectrum Yaz when the sentencing happens for Brian Koberger on July 23rd because there may be an opportunity to hear from all these families right?  Yeah, exactly. But Ethan Chapin's parents in that interview with Liz Creutz said they're not going to be there on the sentencing day for Brian Koberger because they want to be with their family, enjoying the day, looking ahead and not rehashing what has already come to be. But certainly this will be an opportunity for, as you said, closure, any sort of closure that you can actually have after the murder of your children at the sentencing on July 23rd for Brian Koberger.  Yasmin Vasugian, thank you very much for bringing us that reporting. Thanks to Liz, too, for that interview. Appreciate it. Still to come here on the show, much more, including what your favorite Sesame Street character is saying tonight after somebody hacked up a hateful store. It's tonight's Original Now with in-depth reporting on a topic we've been watching. And tonight, it's the unknown hacker who took over Elmo's account this weekend. Yes, that Elmo.  posting a series of hateful and anti-Semitic things which were deleted pretty quickly. All of it with public media already under the microscope this week now that the Senate is expected to vote on whether or not to claw back a big chunk of federal money. Our Mel Zinona has the story.  Sesame Street scrambling to do damage control today after Elmo's ex got hacked this weekend. The account of America's favorite furry red monster shocking its half a million plus followers with a string of posts, not only making anti-semitic and racist comments, but also a derogatory reference to President Trump in connection to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, according to the Associated Press. NBC News did not independently review the posts before they were deleted.  Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind Elmo and Sesame Street, confirming to NBC News the account was hacked, calling the post, quote, disgusting, and adding they're working to restore full control of the account. Needless to say, the post's not on brand for the friendly Muppet. It's really important to respect everybody. Elmo going viral last year, inadvertently starting a mental health campaign when he tweeted, how's everybody doing? And Elmo's glad that he got to talk to a lot of people.  Now, after the hack, Senator Mike Lee posting, I'm forever scarred by Elmo. Words I never expected to utter. Democrat Representative Jared Moskowitz trying to turn attention to a different controversy facing public broadcaster, posting, see what happens when you defund PBS?  The Senate is expected to vote this week on whether to take back $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds both NPR and PBS. Trump demanding Republicans defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or risk losing his endorsement. The executive order pushing for the cuts said NPR and PBS provide biased and partisan news coverage.  The heads of those organizations pushing back with NPR's chief executive, also emphasizing that people relying on independent local stations, especially in rural regions, will feel the impact immediately."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 98, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 5780.328, "text": "Good afternoon."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 99, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 5781.35, "text": "Senate Minority Leader Schumer threatening a shutdown if Republicans, quote, cave to the president's demands."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 100, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 5787.322, "text": "It is not OK.

But there are still Republicans who have serious issues with these spending cuts. You have some Republicans, like Susan Collins, for example. She has issues with the cuts to foreign aid and critical anti-HIV AIDS programs like PEPFAR.  And then you have other Republicans who, yes, are concerned about these cuts to PBS and NPR, which they say are critical for providing not only news, but also things like weather alerts into rural areas, something that is obviously top of mind after those devastating floods in Texas last week.  The Senate could make some changes to this bill over the next few days. If they do that, though, Hallie, then they need to send it back to the House in order to send it to Trump's desk. So the time is ticking here, though, because they have to act by July 19th in order to unlock this special process to avoid using Democratic votes in the Senate, Hallie.

My amendment would have penalized states from giving Medicaid benefits to illegal immigrants who were charged or convicted of serious crimes like murder, human trafficking, child abuse, or child pornography. Forty-three Democrats  voted against that. Turning it the other way around, that means 43 Democrats were for providing government benefits to illegal immigrants who were charged or convicted of very serious crimes. You really can't make this stuff up. It's stranger than fiction.  Our colleagues across the aisle showed their true colors by voting for taxpayers to continue paying for government hands out to folks who shouldn't even be in this country in the first place, but for the open border policies of the Biden administration. One accusation I find particularly ironic from our friends across the aisle has been this idea that we have somehow added red tape  to Medicaid by requiring recipients to verify their eligibility for the program two times a year. Well, people come in and out of the Medicaid program based on that means testing, based on their earnings threshold. So checking periodically to make sure that people still qualify strikes me as making good sense. But when Republicans talk about cutting red tape, we're talking about ways we can get government out of the way.  of our small businesses, our entrepreneurs, so that our economy can grow and so that people can create wealth for themselves and their families and their benefits and their beneficiaries. We're talking about reducing the government's footprint so that the magic of American innovation can take place unstifled by unnecessary regulations.  This bill will allow America to return to being the land of opportunity where hard-working men and women who have a dream for a better life can build a business to support themselves and their families and have something to pass on to the next generation, and at the same time to provide jobs  for people who want to work and provide for their families. So eligibility verification for those receiving means-tested government benefits is not simply red tape. It's a perfectly reasonable requirement when somebody is receiving a government benefit to prove that you actually are eligible according to the law.  This will also help us safeguard our safety net for those who are truly among the most vulnerable and root out waste, fraud, and abuse. There's no evidence that anything  that the bill did or will do will reduce things like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather forecasting. Yet we hear Democrats claiming that somehow this bill was responsible for things like the terrible flooding that occurred in Texas on July the 4th.  There's simply no evidence of that, yet that doesn't stop them and some of the press from parroting these false claims that some of the provisions of the bill, which were just signed on July the 4th, somehow had that effect. No, our Democratic colleagues are simply unreconciled to the fact that last November, voters gave Republicans a mandate  President Trump won the electoral vote, the popular vote, and every single swing state. And Republicans won the majorities in both houses, in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. And passing the big, beautiful bill was an important step in keeping our promises to the American people and advancing President Trump's legislative agenda. But there's more.  In addition to extending President Trump's tax cuts, a critical part of his campaign was to restore security to the US-Mexico border and to end the rampage of criminal activity that went unchecked during the Biden administration. So in addition to spending reforms and tax cuts, the big beautiful bill made good on his promise and my promise and the promise of many of us  to take steps to secure our southern border and to protect and to support once again law enforcement rather than to make it impossible for them to do their job.  In Texas, Governor Abbott and the state spent billions of dollars in something called Operation Lone Star, which is a fill the gap program that the state implemented because the Biden administration refused to secure the border, which is a federal government responsibility. And the federal government should have funded that effort, but did not.  The big beautiful bill includes provisions to reimburse states like Texas for their efforts to do the federal government's job, but one that the federal government simply refused to do under the Biden-Harris administration. I think reimbursement of that funding is only fair, and I'm glad the Senate and the House have now made that a provision of this legislation.  This legislation will also fulfill President Trump's pledge to make our cities and streets safe again through provisions that bolster our nation's border security and law enforcement efforts. Over at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the big, beautiful bill will provide additional funding to hire, retain, and train personnel who will carry out the President's immigration agenda, something that he was elected on  and people repudiated the position of the Biden-Harris administration, which essentially was one of no controls. The hardworking men and women in law enforcement at ICE will receive performance and signing bonuses, as well as recruitment, hiring, and onboarding costs for those personnel. The bill provides resources for ICE and federal law enforcement training  upgrades, as well as fleet modernization. These are important elements of actually enforcing our immigration laws. And it will support enforcement and removal operations so that criminal aliens who've entered the country during the Biden administration can be removed. In addition to the criminals, there are roughly one and a half million people who have pursued some relief  from in the form of asylum who've been denied any sort of relief from the immigration laws and who've been ordered removed from the country but simply stayed in the United States and defied being repatriated. Well, that is now going to change under the Trump administration.  Our bill also allocates funding to the Department of Justice to combat drug trafficking and illegal drug use, as well as to investigate and prosecute crimes related to illegal immigration. These provisions will help keep America safer by shoring up law enforcement across the board to right the wrongs of the previous administration.  During the last four years, Texas, because of our 1,200 mile common border with Mexico, has particularly suffered under President Biden and DHS Secretary Mayorkas' reckless open border policies. This legislation is an important step in correcting the previous administration's costly, and in some cases deadly, errors.  Last November, the voters voted to turn the page on the failed policies of the Biden administration, and passing this bill was a critical step in reversing those policies. This bill will put more money in taxpayers' pockets and allow us to avoid the largest tax increase in American history. It will strengthen our border and support law enforcement.  I was disheartened, disappointed, but not surprised, frankly, that our Democratic colleagues voted to block the bill, preferring instead, I assume, since they offered no viable alternative, to foist that large tax increase on the American people, which would have amounted to a $2.6 trillion tax hike on households earning less than $400,000 a year.  I'm glad they did not prevail, and I'm sure those taxpayers agree. And next April, when tax season rolls around, I'm confident taxpayers will agree and will be thanking the Grand Ole Party for this one big, beautiful bill."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker outlines the main points of the Republican bill, emphasising its focus on eligibility verification for Medicaid, border security, and tax cuts.

So there are separate cases too that are challenging the unlawful actions of this administration to cut resources, especially when it comes to the human capital that school districts need.  And as we all know, we have a mental health epidemic, not just here in Massachusetts, but across the country, that will only be exacerbated if we're not able to continue to fund our school districts, relying not only on state resources, but federal resources.

In May, the President announced Ms. Herman Darfur was the very first judicial nominee of his second term. And now she is the President's first judicial nominee to come to the floor of the Senate. The President has been clear that his primary concern is not about his judicial nominee's experience,  competence, or integrity. This president is not focused on temperament, independence, or respect for the rule of law. He's focused on a nominee's perceived loyalty to him and his agenda, and a willingness to rule in favor of him and his administration. When we consider the president's priorities and Ms. Hermendorfer's record, it's easy to understand why the president nominated her to serve  on the Sixth Circuit. At the office of Tennessee Attorney General, Ms. Hermandorfer leads the Strategic Litigation Unit. Why is that significant? She's not just defending state laws in Tennessee. She's turned the Attorney General's office into an advocacy arm for the Trump agenda. She's argued in support of President Trump's unconstitutional executive order that purports to end birthright citizenship.  This executive order has been blocked by every judge who's considered it. One judge, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, I might add, said, and I quote, I've been on the bench for over four decades. I can't remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order, end of quote. And yet, Ms. Hermandarfer signed amicus briefs in support of that.  and supported the president's unlawful efforts to fire inspectors general and heads of independent agencies. Her record makes it clear that if confirmed, she will continue to enable rather than check an administration that has repeatedly exceeded its authority. Ms. Hermandarfer also refuses to acknowledge that President Trump lost the 2020 election. Let me repeat that. This nominee who seeks a lifetime appointment to the federal bench  when asked the basic question as to whether Donald Trump won or lost the 2020 election, gave the stock answer. She refuses to acknowledge that Donald Trump lost. In response to this simple question, did President Trump lose the 2020 election? All she could say was, quote, President Biden was certified as the winner of the 2020 presidential election and served as the 46th president of the United States, end of quote.  This is the standard response from this administration's nominees seeking positions on the federal bench. It is an embarrassing genuflection before the big lie. The question of who won the 2020 election is not a matter of political opinion. It's a matter of historical fact. The overwhelming majority of my Republican colleagues have correctly recognized that reality.  And we have a right to expect nominees to acknowledge such historic realities as well. Both President Trump's nominees, including Ms. Hermendorfer, have been afraid to admit he lost the 2020 election. Why are they afraid of it? It's a fact. They're afraid because it'll make him angry. He may dump their nominations because of the answer to that question. The fact that she's willing to condone President Trump's false claims further demonstrates a level of partisanship and deference  to this president that is unacceptable for someone seeking a lifetime position on the federal bench. And just in case her political leanings aren't clear enough from her record, Ms. Hermendorfer also has strong ties to a range of right-wing organizations. They include the fabled Federalist Society and the Tinio Network. Tinio Network is a new conservative group funded by Leonard Leo.  and his affiliated organizations. You may have heard the name Leonard Leo recently when President Trump called Mr. Leo a sleazebag, and I quote, membership in such organizations has been a litmus test for years for Republican nominees. It's the secret handshake, my friends. If you belong to the Federalist Society or now this Tenio network, you're in.  It means that a nominee will use the Republican playbook for deciding important federal cases. How does it work? You claim to be neutral. But in fact, you contort history and overturn precedents to reach the Republican preferred outcome. Ms. Herman Darfur has followed this playbook to a T in the Tennessee Attorney General's office. She's opposed LGBTQ rights and reproductive rights, as well as environmental and anti-discriminatory  discrimination policies that protect the most vulnerable in America. I believe we need judges on the bench who will follow the law and the Constitution, not politicians in robes who rule in favor of the president and wealthy special interests. Finally, I'd like to note that Ms. Hermandarter's academic record, though impressive, and her legal record, though extreme, is short. She graduated from law school in 2015.  has fewer than 10 years legal experience. And outside of her clerkships, she's only practiced law for six years, and she's seeking a lifetime appointment to a circuit court, one of the highest in the land. She's never served as sole or chief counsel in any case, any case, tried to verdict, judgment, or final decision. That is a shocking lack of experience for someone nominated for a lifetime position. She'll be watching trials for the first time  As a judge, unfortunately this kind of experience is common among President Trump's judicial nominees. Make no mistake, experience is still important. Robust litigation experience ensures that judicial nominees will be equipped to fulfill their duties. As an appellate judge, she's going to be standing in judgment of many trial courts. She has limited experience in that field.  Ms. Hermendorfer is the first judicial nominee we've considered this Congress. She won't be the last. In every instance, we must carefully examine the nominee's record as we consider them for a lifetime appointment. After carefully reviewing her record, I have serious concerns. I think my colleagues, if they look at her honestly, will as well. I urge them to join me in opposing her nomination."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker argues that Whitney Herman Darfur is unfit for a lifetime appointment on the federal bench due to her loyalty to President Trump, her advocacy for his unconstitutional policies, and her lack of experience.

I think two things. First, I think slightly different about the conditions. We have an amendment to our constitution which speaks to cruel and unusual punishment, but really speaks to fines and the kinds of hurdles you can make it for everyday people to be able to appeal decisions. And then there's a part of it that speaks to the wanton treatment that, or careless treatment that some may,  impose on those in detention or prisons. I don't know the case. I listen to the congressman. We'll have to see. If someone brings a case, the court will make that determination. For me, the issue still remains, because I support what Mr. Homan is doing as it relates to the worst and first. Those cases, those examples you gave, Jessie, I agree with, and I think I'm with the 70% of Americans who say that you got to take those guys out first, men and women, assuming that they're mostly men.  But then you get to the part about the hierarchy of deportations and the people that are in our communities, people who run businesses, who work in businesses that many of us consider central to our daily lives. I'm sensitive to what Greg talked about in terms of, and you've talked about it too, the inflation of wages and how we are, all this deflationary pressure because we're hiring people and we're not paying them what we might pay a citizen. I contend that there are a lot of people working in the economy who we are paying,  normal wages. I contend there are a lot of people who just are not citizens, who have become part of our culture and part of our society. I read this story over the weekend in one of the national papers about a fellow out of Arkansas who was against illegal immigration and wants strong border security. He met a woman online. She happened to be illegal. She lived in another state.  She ran her own business, then worked in a restaurant. He drove to get her, brought her back to Arkansas. You know what he's doing? He's so committed there, he's leaving the country. He's gonna go to El Salvador with her so she can get in line. That's more than true love. I admire what that guy's doing, but he also makes a point in the article that we need to have a better system of how people become citizens, particularly people who are following the rules. I think that's where the country, as you look at the polling data on President Trump, it's moving a little bit, saying they don't,  fully approve of all that's happening right now. They want the worst first out, but they're not clear on some of the other things.

I'd like to dedicate my segment to Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her comments. So during the Biden administration, during those years, they were sued over the conditions that the minors, the illegal immigrant minors were in, right? They were eating bloody chicken. They were urinating in plastic bags. They were on suicide watch.  cutting themselves with their ID cards, and she was radio silent the entire time. In fact, what I heard from her in March of 2023 was saying to the world that fentanyl was actually being trafficked through legal ports of entry by Americans, and then she went on  to criticize Governor DeSantis' legislation proposed that would impose stricter penalties on human traffickers because, she said, in the typical racist tropes of the Democrat Party, she said, you're going to have vegetables rotting in the fields. You're going to have construction sites that will lie dormant. Tourism and the restaurant industry in particular rely on these workers, to Greg's point, instead of lifting up  those workers and say, look, cheap labor should not be part and parcel to the fabric of our society. In fact, it's morally wrong. And here, let me propose legislation to get these guys actually accurate pay and all the things. None of that. So now she says, you brush your teeth where you go to the bathroom. Same thing. I don't know one. I mean, I don't know. I've never been to a billionaire's house that has separate from that. So welcome to the USA. And it reminds me of a case I worked on in California.  where an inmate who liked to have sex with babies, which was why he was incarcerated, complained about his hip and wanted special accommodations for the hip pain. And here's all the things that I need. And all of us sitting there listening to him essentially said, you know what? I can't muster up even one care right now. And if I did, that care would be reserved for  homeless veterans, or military service people who are living in moldy conditions, or maybe the victims of these illegal immigrants who didn't even get a shot at life. So save it, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, because I think there's a lot more cares that Americans have before they start caring about her talking about brushing your teeth or they poop right now.

Or, you know, go after Fetterman. Go after somebody. The media will gobble that up. Or you go after some foreign leader. Take an axe to chi or go after the cartels or something.

He should imagine the Democratic Party showing up in Shark Tank, you know, hello sharks, I want 100% investment.

So he gives a message that's like any of us could say, yeah, toughen up. It's not really great advice. It reminds me of when Biden and Harris told Putin not to invade Ukraine. They said don't.  They said, if you're thinking of crossing the border illegally, don't. And none of that mattered. The other messages that the Democrats have received lately are not only just get tough, curse more, make a stupid video, or get shot. That was the advice last week.

In 2021, the first year of Joe Biden's administration, President Trump's popularity rating took a little bit of a hit because of some things that happened in the beginning of the year, and he reemerged. So I don't, I understand where we're going, but I look at it this way. I take Mark Cuban at his word. We do need new ideas, you're right. He should approach it the way he does on that show. We did innovation in our approaches.  plans for the future, actionable plans for the future. We should be willing, as we spell out these ideas, to give Trump credit where credit is due. What he's done on the border has shown us that had we changed our mind and been able to change Ms. Harris's mind or Mr. Biden's mind about what they should have been doing, we might have had a different outcome. The same is true with what we did in Iran.  helping to eliminate or obliterate or set back their nuclear program was a good thing. But Democrats, get out and point to Mr. Trump. You said that over the last four years, DEI had ruined our military. For 24 years, they've been planning, figuring out ways to go after those mountains, and they did it, even with DEI.  Say to the president, you are right. We welcome you in wanting to send arms and munitions to continue the things that Dems and Republicans have done for Mr. Zelensky. But say, why wait 50 days? There's no need to wait 50 days to let Russia come around. Put the hammer down on him even sooner. I'd invite the housing secretary to my district if I were in Congress, saying, you know what? I've identified three areas that the federal government owns and the city owns and the state owns. We can do affordable housing here. Let's figure out how we reduce the regulations to make that happen.  I'd say to those who the President wants to make no taxes on tips, if you're a teacher or a nurse and you earn $85,000 a year and there's someone in your area that earns $85,000 a year mainly on tips, why should they get the tax break and you don't? Democrats introduced legislation to cure that. That's what  what Cuban should be saying, I think what he's trying to say, but I don't disagree with you about what President Obama said. Saying that in the confines of a billionaire's home is very different than getting out and saying where people live, who are working every day to raise their kids, keep their neighborhoods safe, et cetera.

Basically, we're sending the weapons and the Europeans are going to pay for them. Ukraine will be rearmed in a significant way, and perhaps that will finally bring Putin to the negotiating table. Putin made a big mistake trying to play Donald Trump. He can't do it.  After three or four ceasefire-related phone calls, or who knows how many, Putin then goes back and starts bombing Ukraine's civilians. That's an absolute no-go for Mr. Trump.

Anyway, Trump made it absolutely clear that he wants the war to stop and that he inherited Joe Biden's war. Trump believes, and I'm sure he's right, that Putin just waited for Biden to come into office and then he invaded Ukraine.  Certainly Biden's decision to flee from Afghanistan had a lot to do with Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. And we can all remember how pathetic Biden's response was as hundreds of thousands of Russian troops amassed on the eastern border of Ukraine when Biden then said, and I'm going to quote, don't end quote, don't.  which, as one wag put it, is what you say to your dog who's pulling a sock away. Don't didn't stop Putin, and nothing else Biden did stop Putin. And Biden's appeasement with Iran didn't stop Putin, nor his appeasement with China.  Trump is really the first president since Ronald Reagan with an effort to check Russia and its grandiose empire ambitions. Mr. Trump also announced a 100% secondary tariff on Russia, but not for 50 days. Personally, I think it should be a much shorter period.  Also impressive was NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, a former conservative prime minister of the Netherlands and a Trump friend and ally. But even more than that, the NATO countries agreed with President Trump to seek defense spending of 5% of GDP, which will send a strong, tough message to Vladimir Putin's phony ambitions. More than any time I can remember, the US is now working in tandem with Europe.  Now there will always be differences, of course. But interestingly, in response to a question on tariffs, Mr. Trump reiterated his 30% EU tariff proposal, but clearly suggested that it was a work in progress and trade negotiations are continuing. By the by, both the stock market and the dollar rallied over the course of the Trump-Ruta press conference.  More than anything, Mr. Trump wants peace, not war. He tried to negotiate with Putin, but it didn't work out. He has inherited a war that would never have happened if Joe Biden were any kind of a strong president. But Biden was a weakling, an appeaser. And Trump has to pick up the pieces and end this Russian problem.  If the United States and the NATO countries of Europe do act in concert, new weapons and all, it will mark the first major show of strength against the dictator Vladimir Putin.

And that was that no longer is the American taxpayer going to foot the bill for traditional security and defense of Europe.  You know, for 76 years, American presidents have been talking about that. Donald Trump delivered it last month. And now the next step is to make Europe pay for the defense and the support of Ukraine, which Joe Biden and, you know, some members of Congress decided that the U.S. taxpayer and the hardworking Americans should be paying for that.  Obviously, America makes the best weapons, and everyone wants them. And Ukraine, to defend themselves, President Trump's been clear, they should get access to U.S. weapons. And so Europe has come through the NATO structure and said, we'll put up the money, we'll buy these American weapons, and we'll send them to Ukraine to defend themselves.  Now, there is already a lot of support for Ukraine happening, and weapons are constantly moving, and that's anything from Patriot missiles, which you mentioned, to things like just ammunition and other types of armaments. But this idea that President Trump has put together and brokered, I think really is a big win for Ukraine.  Ukraine to defend itself, but it's also a big win for the American taxpayer.

Also in the Senate, Republicans are focused on their bill to take back more than $9 billion in federal funds  including for public broadcasting and foreign aid. This is the same House Republican bill that passed last month in the House and the Senate has until Friday to approve it, but it's facing opposition from a handful of Republican holdouts over those foreign aid cuts and also from Democrats who say any rescissions would hurt future bipartisan government funding talks.

That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you were planning to do in 50 days at this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin.

Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who's on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, posted on social media today, quote, I'm heartened that Trump is realizing that Putin is the only obstacle to peace in Ukraine. Today's announcement should help ensure that Ukrainians fighting for freedom have the weapons they need to defend themselves so they can be better positioned to secure a lasting peace.  And we heard that question about the Senate sanctions package. That bill would allow the president to levy a 500 percent tariff on imports from countries that purchase Russian uranium, gas and oil. Here are the bill's lead sponsors, Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal and South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, who talked about it yesterday on CBS News Face the Nation. Here's Senator Blumenthal.  This has to be a critical moment for these sanctions and bringing down this sledgehammer at this moment was emphasized by all of the European allies who were at the meeting that Senator Graham and I attended.  in Europe, they are absolutely in solidarity, one after another, in that closed-door setting, express the view that these sanctions have to be tough and rigorous to change behavior. And so the waiver language that we will have in this bill is very much alike the  provisions that have existed in past similar measures that give the president the ability to act in the national security but also provide congressional oversight and I think that kind of assurance to my democratic colleagues is very important but  What is most important, I think, at this moment is our unity. Senator Graham and I, Republican and Democrat coming together, the European leaders with diverse views, also in unity. And we want to make use of the seized assets, again, in a unified way. I think a multifaceted approach here is the only way to bring Putin to the table, because he's a thug. He understands only force.  And here's Senator Graham.

We'll be ready to go. That from Senator Thune.  Now to the Republican funding cuts bill in the Senate this week. As we said, they have until Friday to pass this bill. It's the same bill that passed the House last month by two votes. In total, it cuts $9.4 billion in federal funding. And according to the AP, that includes $1.1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, two thirds of which that money helps fund local public radio and TV stations for their operations.  It also includes $8.3 billion in foreign aid programs. Among them, $900 million to combat HIV, AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water, and sanitation in war-ravaged countries.  $4.15 billion for two economic, civil, and institutional development programs in developing and strategically important countries, and $496 million for food, water, and health aid in countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts.  Other cuts are aimed at the global HIV AIDS program known as PEPFAR, which is credited with saving 26 million lives around the world and has broad bipartisan support in Congress. Republicans who have voiced concern about this bill include Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mike Rounds of South Dakota. In his Leader Time remarks this afternoon, Republican Leader John Thune talked about the 2026 agriculture bill.  Mr. President, the appropriations process is officially underway here in the Senate. Last week, the Appropriations Committee held its first mark of appropriations bills for fiscal year 2026. And I'm pleased to report that the committee referred two bills to the floor with bipartisan support.  And today I want to talk about one of the bills that came out of last week's markup, and that's the Agriculture Appropriations Bill. Mr. President, agriculture is the lifeblood of our country. And in places like my home state of South Dakota, farming and ranching are a big part of our way of life. I know how hard American farmers and ranchers work to deliver food, fuel, and fiber to America and to the world. And I know this work can be challenging, and at times, unforgiving.  In recent years, farmers and ranchers across the country have faced some pretty fierce headwinds. Higher input costs and depressed commodity prices strained their budgets, and higher interest rates made financing more difficult. Then there were the supply chain disruptions, natural disasters and drought, and things like bird flu, African swine fever, and the new world screw worm that threatened livestock.  Mr. President, just two weeks ago, Republicans passed a reconciliation bill that addresses many of the challenges head-on by bolstering programs that farmers and ranchers depend on.  But as I said then, farmers and ranchers' priorities are going to continue to be a priority here in the Senate. And the Agricultural Appropriations Bill is an example of that. Mr. President, our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee have reported a bill that provides robust funding to support America's farmers and ranchers. It provides important funding to the Farm Service Agency, including support for $10.5 billion in capital access for farmers and ranchers.  And it supports efforts to track foreign-owned land to prevent our adversaries, like China, from buying up America's farmland. It also makes investment in rural development programs at USDA. In South Dakota, that money goes far in supporting water programs, electricity, and broadband programs in rural areas.  This bill also invests in conservation programs, and it advances efforts to help farmers and ranchers get their products to the market. I'm glad to see support for processing capacity for meat, poultry, and egg products. And I'm pleased that this bill also promotes programs that help state-inspected plants operate across state lines, which provides producers with more options for their products and supports smaller processors.  The bill also includes funding for the Agriculture Marketing Service to help facilitate greater access to international markets for American agriculture products. And the updated market data that will result from investments in this bill will help farmers and ranchers make better decisions about their businesses. Part of Senate Republican Leader John Thune's Leader Time remarks. Now, the Republicans' rescissions package was on the mind of Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.  The so-called rescissions package continues the destructive Republican pattern. Cut now, ask questions later. The same thing that's happening with FEMA and the National Weather Service is happening right here. Again, use that chainsaw. Cut, cut, cut. Don't look at what you're cutting, what its effect will be, whether it's waste or whether it's sinew and bone. And then later say, oh, maybe we shouldn't have done that.  And you know what, Mr. President? Our Republican senators, most of them, know this is wrong, but they're so afraid of Donald Trump. Yesterday, he threatened any of them who voted against the full rescissions package that we have before us would face his wrath. What is going on here? Does anyone stand up to these horrible, horrible cuts that hurt the American people?  Republicans in real time are cutting health care. They're cutting education. They're cutting aid for our veterans. Veterans are not getting, they ask them. The veterans know they're not getting the health care they used to. And making things even worse, Donald Trump's tariffs are coming in at the worst possible time. And in a few short months, they're going to raise the cost of groceries. They're going to hurt small businesses and do untold damage to our economy.  And now this package suffocates public broadcast. Well, did they even know when they said they wanted to cut it? You know, Donald Trump doesn't seem to like it. How much it helps our rural communities? It's the only place they can rely on for local news, for weather reports? That farmers across rural America depend on public broadcast to get weather reports? Because there's no other way?  Did they know that it cuts international aid that ensures America's national security? Did they even think of the consequences? Just because Donald Trump says he wants it cut and everyone knows he doesn't know the details of any of this stuff.  The rescissions package is certainly troubling, but the pattern behind it is even worse. It sets the stage for even more party-line devastating cuts in the future, to health care, to education, anything Republicans decide they don't like. All on a party-line vote, all because of obeisance and fear of Donald Trump, not a conviction that he's doing the right thing. This is a dark omen moving forward.  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Politico Congress reporter Jordan Carney reporting Missouri Republican Senator Eric Schmidt, who is spearheading the rescissions package in the Senate, was at the White House this afternoon to meet with President Trump on the funding clawback per person familiar with per person familiar with what happened there.  White House Budget Director Russell Vought is also coming to the Hill tomorrow, according to Jordan Carney. And she's also reporting the Senate wants to take first votes on this bill on Tuesday. Now, you can see the Senate's consideration of this bill live all week on C-SPAN, too.  C-SPAN.org and the free C-SPAN Now mobile app. The House is also back to work this week on their agenda, several cybersecurity bills, including legislation requiring the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications Agency to examine the cybersecurity of wireless networks, and a bill directing the Consumer Product Safety Commission to create a pilot program to study the use of AI.  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke to reporters today. One of the issues on his mind, today's White House Russia announcement. Vladimir Putin has spent the entire year punking Donald Trump and the Trump administration. Donald Trump promised many things to the American people and continues to betray the American people and break promise after promise after promise in a whole lot of areas.  including Donald Trump's promise that there would be peace in Ukraine on day one of his presidency. How is that working out? Donald Trump has spent the first six months of his presidency playing footsie with Vladimir Putin.  And the response from Vladimir Putin, a sworn enemy of the United States of America, has been to unleash terror on Ukrainian children, communities, and civilians. Donald Trump has zero credibility in this area. Is he just now figuring out that Ukraine is a friend to the United States of America and Russia is an enemy? Is he just now figuring out  that the United States should always stand on the side of democracy, freedom, and truth, which is standing with Ukraine, as opposed to standing on the side of authoritarianism, tyranny, and propaganda, which is what he's been doing by standing with Russia and Vladimir Putin? Is he just now figuring this out? Congress has to act independently in this area, and we should sanction Russia and continue to keep the pressure on.  Vladimir Putin, and Russia, a sworn enemy of this country, until the Ukrainian people are able to achieve victory for themselves, our NATO allies in Europe, and the free world.  And from USA Today, Texas Democratic Representative Mark Veazey has introduced a resolution calling for the release of all unclassified files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Representative Veazey posted on social media yesterday, quote, either Trump and his acolytes fueled the rumors of the significance of these Epstein files to help his campaign or something is there. Put up or shut up.  USA Today noting that candidate Donald Trump said last year that he would support releasing additional details about the Epstein case, but a memo by the Justice Department and FBI that came out July 7th reported no evidence of a client list or that Epstein had been murdered while in custody.  This comes after President Trump posted on social media over the weekend his support for Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel's handling of the case, writing, quote, Let's not waste time and energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about. But Leader Jeffrey's was asked about it this afternoon. The American people deserve to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as it relates to this whole sorted Jeffrey Epstein matter.  Democrats didn't put the Jeffrey Epstein thing into the public domain. This was a conspiracy that Donald Trump, Pam Bondi, and these MAGA extremists have been fanning the flames of for the last several years. And now the chickens are coming home to roost. The American people deserve to know the truth. What, if anything, is the Trump administration and the Department of Justice hiding?  What are you hiding? If you're not hiding anything, prove that to the American people. And if you are trying to hide something, as many of Donald Trump's MAGA supporters apparently believe, then the Congress should actually work hard to try to uncover the truth for the American people. There are only two things that are possible here. Option one,  Donald Trump, Pam Bondi, and the MAGA extremists intentionally lied to the American people for years about the Jeffrey Epstein situation. That's option one. Option two is that, in fact, there's reason for the American people to be concerned as it relates to what  information has not been released that could be damaging to the Trump administration and the friends and family of the Trump administration and their billionaire corrupt supporters. And so they're actively engaging in a cover-up. Option one, they lied for years. Option two, they're engaging in a cover-up. At this point, it seems reasonable that it can only be one of the two things.  And so it's Congress's responsibility in a bipartisan way to ask the questions and try to get answers on behalf of the American people."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1560.547, "text": " all the files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

Obviously, President Trump has been vocal over the weekend in that social media post, basically saying it was time to put the Epstein files behind his MAGA base. But I talked to one MAGA strategist who is close to the White House, who basically said that  The president's base is unmoved by that post, telling people to move on, but also telling people to kind of lay off attorney general Pam Bondi, who has basically faced the brunt of the attacks when it comes to how this administration has handled the Epstein files. So folks in that base are unmoved and they're going to continue asking questions.  I think that the onus is now on president Trump to see how he continues to respond. If he basically ignores his base, something that folks have been vocal about saying that for really the first time in this first six months, they view it as Trump misjudging the moment or misjudging where his base is at. We know that president Trump is somebody who likes to check in on his base and who likes to be up to date on how they're feeling and how they're reacting to the post. So there's going to be a question about how president Trump handles this.  but also a president, a question about how deputy FBI chief Dan, Dan Bergino handles this. Obviously we know that he did not show up for work on Friday. A notice was able to confirm because he was so upset at Pam Bondi over her handling of the Epstein case. So there's going to be a question of whether or not he shows up today. He shows up the rest of the week and how long he does stay with the administration. But obviously there are some major questions that they're going to have to decide on in that building behind me.  about how they go forward because we know that President Trump likes to be very loyal to his base because he feels as though they are very loyal to him. But in this case, they're having a real issue."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 25, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1689.487, "text": "Jasmine Wright, White House reporter for Notice on this morning's Washington Journal on the White House handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. You're listening to Washington Today.  In a nation divided, a rare moment of unity, this fall, C-SPAN presents C-SPIRE, where the shouting stops and the conversation begins in a town where partisan fighting prevails. One table, two leaders, one goal, to find common ground. This fall, C-SPIRE, on the network that doesn't take sides, only on C-SPAN.  Welcome back to Washington Today from Politico. Late this afternoon, a divided Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Education Department to fire almost 40 percent of its workforce, four months after President Trump ordered his administration to begin closing down the department. The justices, by an apparent 6-3 vote, lifted an injunction.  from a federal judge in Boston that was granted back in May against the firing. That judge found that the staff cuts were so drastic they would prevent the department from carrying out duties mandated by Congress. The judge also said the mass firings appear to be part of Trump's plan to eliminate the education department entirely despite a lack of congressional authorization to do so. That from Politico late this afternoon.  Yesterday was the one year anniversary of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. And today, a group of Republican study committee members introduced a resolution marking the anniversary. Here's Pennsylvania Republican Mike Kelly, whose hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania, was where the attack occurred. Yesterday, I returned to the Butler Farm Showgrounds, where I was with the president a year ago. I met with the Comptore family during a celebration of Corey's life.  They are incredibly strong, and I know all of us on stage continue to send our thoughts and prayers to them as we seek more answers about what actually happened that day. Now, we're here today to highlight new Resolution HR 571, which formally recognized the events of 2014 and July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. The resolution also condemns the rise in political violence we have seen across our nation over the last year.  from the assassination attempts against President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida, to the attacks against Governor Josh Shapiro in April, and to the deadly attacks on the Minnesota state lawmakers just last month. Let's be clear.  We must stand up together to oppose violence against our nation's leaders all across each party. And I want to thank my co-lead on the resolution, RSC Chairman August Fluger from Texas. When we talk about this, though, we can have as many resolutions as we want to bring it forward. And I've heard person after person, politician after politician, get up and say, I am absolutely appalled by the violence that's taking place in this country today.  And we've got to stop using that type of language. And with 24 hours, they're out talking again about who should not be sitting in certain offices. So it's one thing to have a resolution. It's one thing to be resolved the fact we're not going to keep talking like this. What I'm asking all our Congress, everybody that's in the Congress, everybody that's in elected office, please watch what you say. Don't start off saying we should never do this.  and then within 24 hours go out and make statements again that incite people? That's a false lead. It's a false premise. Our resolution is an attempt to get people to speak the way they should speak. In America, the way we settle things is by votes.  Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Mike Kelly, and in an article on city and state PA dot com, Representative Kelly said he still wonders why federal law enforcement agencies allowed Donald Trump to go on stage that day, saying, quote, they knew there was a suspicious person on the grounds for an hour and a half before the president came out on the stage. After everything was said and done, I still ask, why did they let President Trump come out on the stage when they knew the site was not secure? That will forever be my question.  Also from today, from CBS12.com in Palm Beach, Florida, what was meant to be a surprise inspection turned into a tightly managed tour. But what Florida lawmakers saw inside Alligator Alcatraz left them horrified. On Saturday afternoon, four Florida representatives, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Darren Soto, Maxwell Frost, and Jared Moskowitz were given what they call a sanitized tour of Alligator Alcatraz.  from officials at Florida's Division of Emergency Management and also federal officials. The members stated that despite the alleged limited access and sanitation of the tour, the conditions were, quote, horrific. They reported seeing people held in cages, unsanitary eating conditions, people begging for freedom, a man who said he had been hospitalized for days, among other concerning conditions. Representative Frost talked about what he saw in a town hall on Saturday."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 26, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2034.245, "text": " These are very nuts and bolts questions.

Their goal is to get to 4000 capacity, 4000 beds by August. I'm going to a couple of weeks here. They're going to be adding an additional 1000 beds to it within the next week or so. And we saw that those new cages that they were working on the demographic. This facility.  It is a mix of people. There are a lot of people there who just have a civil offense or just something very low that they were picked up for all the way up to people who have done violent crimes and all in between.  There is a wristband system when they arrive that they put on them to determine what kind of offense they had, most of them being civil offenses and small offenses, and they do not have them segregated. It's just a big hodgepodge of people all put together. And I asked a few questions.  on mental health issues and how people can seek mental health help. If I ask the company, there's a third-party company that's doing all the medical work. I'm looking through my notes to try to find a name for you guys. It's a third-party company that's doing all the medical work. I asked them, how often are you asked by the  People running the facility who might not be able to be put in the general population because of a health condition because of this and that they weren't able to answer the question. Then it looks like there's not a ton of communication on that front either. This leads me to another thing that I forgot to mention that I think is really important. This facility, when we 1st pulled up.  It was mainly third party security companies that were running the parking and the security and all of this. Then we get into the facility. And when we were at that, at the tent where all the cages are, the people holding us back and the people in there dealing with the detainees were from a third party security company. We barely saw any federal agents  A few people from the National Guard, a few people who are trained law enforcement officers, but it was mainly essentially cops for hire. Not any different than the people who want you, you know, if you were to go into a concert or go to a sports game. And these are a lot of the folks who are dealing with the detainees, transporting them around the facility and are essentially running the whole thing. So this is also a huge source of taxpayer money just going to corporations, but also  What worries me too is these people do not have the training you need to run a facility like this. Florida Democratic Representative Maxwell Frost on a town hall on Saturday talking about what he saw at the immigrant detention facility known as Alligator Alcatraz.  CBS12.com also reporting that Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis defended the management of that detention facility, saying, quote, it's not the Four Seasons. It's a professional processing center to effectuate the deportation of illegal aliens. That's what it's for. It's professionally run. It's going to be value added.  And from CNBC.com, dozens of U.S. ice cream producers say they are planning to remove artificial colors from their products by 2028. CNBC writes the producers, which represent more than 90 percent of ice cream sold in the U.S., are the latest food companies to take voluntary steps to remove dyes since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said back in April that the U.S. aimed to phase out many synthetic dyes from the country's food supply.  Secretary Kennedy talked about it at an event today that included Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and officials from the International Dairy Foods Association. I'm particularly happy to be here today because this is relevant to my favorite food, which is ice cream.  Since we came in about five and a half months ago and started talking about eliminating dyes and other bad chemicals from our food, we've had this extraordinary response from the industry. And Brooke just rattled off this inventory, this extraordinary inventory of national corporate food producers have all made commitments  to remove food dyes from their food. And with this addition today of the dairymen and the dairy food producers, we now have about 35% of American food industry that has made commitments. And that's an addition between 35% and 40%.  And that is in addition to the 35% of the food industry that was already organic and healthy and chemical free.  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. CNBC notes several major food manufacturers, including General Mills, Kraft Heinz, James Smucker, Hershey and Nestle USA, have previously announced their plans to phase out synthetic food coloring. The IDFA said artificial dyes are safe, but that ice cream makers are taking this step in part to avoid disruption to sales from state efforts.  to phase out dyes from school foods and also West Virginia's recent food dye ban.

And so we're encouraged by some of the conversations that this administration's have on addressing some of these urgent needs. But the reality is a lot of consumers across the country just don't purchase a flood insurance policy, partially because they don't realize they need to have it.

It's really hard to compete in the private market when you've got an NFIP.  and even have those conversations with Congress about how do we reauthorize this program, make sure it doesn't go bankrupt and these type of pieces. It's really confusing for consumers anytime we're talking about insurance, but then when you need to go layer it on another layer, another protection policy that you need to have, it makes it a challenge.

Thank you, Mr. President. I am so pleased that we're going to move forward today on the rescission package that has come over to us from the House. As I talk to Tennesseans, one of the number one things they talk about is the debt. What are we doing to stop the out-of-control spending and to get this national debt under control?  And after you look at what happened with COVID and with the Joe Biden years, we are sitting at $37 trillion in debt. So last November, the American people voted to make a change on how this country is running. One of the things they wanted to see changed was out of control, reckless spending.  Now, if you look at this debt and where it stands right now, and you say, how much am I, as an American citizen, responsible for, each and every citizen in this country would be holding $108,000 in debt. Think about that. All of our citizens, each and every one of us,  Whether you're the dad, the mom, the children, each and every citizen bears the burden of $108,000 in our nation's debt.  One of the things that came up this weekend when I was at home and somebody was asking about the rescission package and when we were going to get this done and start making some of the cuts, start making the DOJ cuts, and this was a veteran, and they pointed out that they were aware that we are spending more money to pay  the interest on our debt than we are spending to fund the U.S. military. Think about that.  Think about what that message is that goes to other countries as they are looking at what we're spending on national defense compared to what we're spending on our debt. What does that say about the priorities that we have as a nation?  So, Tennesseans know that the path we're on with this spending is not sustainable. We can't continue this. When you look at where we were  with our debt when George Bush was president, and you were at about $10.5 trillion when he left the Oval Office and Barack Obama and Joe Biden come in, and they doubled that number. You had President Trump's first term and COVID hit, and then the out-of-control spending  by the Biden White House, that is how you end up at $37 trillion, and it should concern everyone. And, Mr. President, I guess we're learning the auto pen was signing a lot of those sales receipts over at the White House.  The point is, we have this debt. Now, the good thing is that when the American people voted to get this spending under control last November, they sent President Donald Trump back to the White House, back to the Oval Office, and yes, indeed,  He has gotten busy looking at how we spend the taxpayer money. He has spent time looking at the resources that we have and how we utilize those resources. And indeed, they have targeted $190 billion in this year's budget documents for waste, fraud, and abuse.  and for removing those programs to yield that savings to the American people. And I think the American people see this as a victory for them and for their pocketbook. Hardworking taxpayers want to keep more of their money. They don't want to be sending it to D.C. for programs that have outlived their usefulness, programs they've never heard of, programs  that they don't want. So we have the opportunity now  to go in and claw back some of that money, draw a red line right through the middle of those programs in that budget document, and make these savings permanent. Should we do that? Absolutely, we should be doing that. And that is why you are seeing Republicans here in the Senate choose to move forward  on the rescission package that will save $9 billion out of this year's budget. And you know, as you think about it,  Budgets are 10-year windows, so you're not going to see those items next year or the next or the next. So you're going to compound those savings. $9 billion each year in that 10-year budget. Those savings mount up.  And it is what the American people are wanting to see us do to get rid of some of this reckless spending. Now, Mr. President, there are some good examples of programs that we are going to draw that red line through those programs.  and eliminate them from this budget document. There's $1.1 billion for the Corporation of Public Broadcasting. Now, this is an organization that funds NPR and PBS. And what we know, think about NPR. They have been pushing a left-wing ideology using the taxpayers' money  for years. And my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Kennedy, talked some about Catherine Mayer, who is NPR's CEO, and the things that she has had to say about President Trump. And she has called him all sorts of names.  Now, she is not somebody that's neutral, and she is not somebody that wants to give you a point and a counterpoint. She has an opinion, and she is using your tax dollars to spread her opinion far and wide. One of the things that they did ahead of the 2020 election  NPR refused to cover the revelations about Hunter Biden's laptop and his overseas business deals. And, Mr. President, at that time, NPR's leadership had this to say, and I quote them, we don't want to waste the listeners' and readers' time on stories that are just pure distractions, end quote.  Now, that was their opinion. They're entitled to that opinion. But they are not entitled to take the taxpayers' hard-earned money and spend it to push their opinion. As we now know, they were wrong. They were wrong.  Now, the rescissions package that is coming before us also cuts billions of dollars in foreign aid spending that really does nothing to promote American values and interests around the globe.  Here's a few of these things. There is a $4 million item for sedentary migrants in Colombia.  That is their term. That is the line item. $4 million for sedentary migrants in Colombia. There's $3 million for an Iraqi version of Sesame Street. There's $1 million for voter ID efforts in Haiti.  $500,000 for electric buses in Rwanda, $6 million for net zero cities. That means no carbon emissions. Net zero cities in Mexico.  and $2.1 million for climate resilience in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. I could stand here for hours and go through some of the ridiculous, absurd items that are listed. And the amounts of your money that you have earned and you've sent to Washington, D.C.  to be spent on God knows what. So it is important, Mr. President, that we look at this and, yes, we're going to make reductions in spending in the appropriations process. But you know what? Doing these cuts  helps to push this forward. You know, there is also some money in this rescission package that is going to be removed from some of these international organizations  that work against our interests. Now, all during COVID, we heard about the World Health Organization and how the World Health Organization was covering up for China, and they were going to be certain that they covered for China, and we would not know the truth about what happened with COVID.  So in this document, we are going to remove $135 million from the World Health Organization and from the UN Human Rights Council, $8 million. The reason to do this, they support dictators, they support repressive regimes, and they are demonizing our ally, Israel.  These are wise decisions to be made about how we spend their money. And you know what? It is common sense. As I've had Tennesseans say to me, it is about time that we start to make these reductions. We know that Tennesseans support these cuts. The American people support these cuts. This is about fiscal responsibility. It is about  thinking about our kids and our grandkids, and what kind of country are they going to inherit? What are we going to leave for them? You know, running up this kind of debt  I think it's so important to remember what Admiral Mullen, who was then Chief of Staff over at the Pentagon, said in July of 2010. And, Mr. President, he was asked, what keeps you up at night? What do you think is the biggest threat? His reply to that reporter, significant.  He said, the greatest threat to our nation, to our freedom, is our nation's debt. It is time for us to stop the out-of-control spending. It is time for us to begin to turn this around and reduce what the federal government spends. Mr. Chairman, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker advocates for the rescission package as a means to control the $37 trillion national debt.

Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you so much to our witnesses for being here. Unfortunately, we are witnessing today yet another political stunt, plain and simple.  Republicans are here drawing a clear line in the sand. They will stop at nothing to advance Donald Trump's agenda and the dangerous blueprint laid out in Project 2025. Even if it means targeting the very groups that are working to protect our communities and support  law enforcement agencies. Let's be clear, my colleagues across the aisle have shown little to no interest in working with Democrats on real solutions for the American people. Instead of addressing pressing civil rights issues constituents actually care about, like wrongful deportations of US citizens, ongoing efforts to undermine voting rights, or the serious flaws in our criminal justice system, this committee is spending its time holding a hearing on  with a title that sounds like it was ripped from a conspiracy blog. This hearing, how leftist nonprofit networks exploit federal tax dollars to advance a radical agenda. Really?  I mean, when I listened to you, Mr. Chairman, who I do respect, I heard you say things about why is it that we're giving money in other places? And I wanna make sure that I answer that question because to put America first looks like we are going to keep American citizens safe. There is a such thing as soft power and that is exactly what we were trying to do when we engaged in things such as USAID. When you start to talk about whether or not  Sesame Street or anything else that's on NPR or PBS ends up in other places. This is so that there is not this warped thought process about the Western world or about the United States. We're talking about making sure that we don't end up allowing people to be radicalized against us because they have  a terrible vision of us because they may be in a government that actually puts out bad, terrible propaganda about us. So for pennies on the dollar, we are able to educate those around the world on who we really are in America and keep Americans safe. Soft power is real power and it minimizes how much money we have to spend, say, on dropping bombs in countries at a random time without, say, congressional authority, but I digress.  This kind of rhetoric, whether directed at nonprofits, their leaders, or elected officials, is not only reckless, it is beneath the dignity of this institution. And sadly, this isn't the first time this has happened. Over the past six months, we've seen hearing after hearing do nothing but attack nonprofits, as well as those who are just generally on a mission to serve, protect, and uplift vulnerable communities.  In just my own committees, this has got to be the second or third time I've had to sit through the same tired narrative. If my Republican colleagues are truly concerned about taxpayer dollars being misused for political agendas, I'd encourage them to take a long, hard look in the mirror. But since we're here again spending more of the American people's money and time on political theater, let's at least stick to the facts.  Fact, under the Trump administration, the Department of Justice stripped hundreds of millions of dollars from the Office of Justice Programs, money that funded essential community safety initiatives like victim services, gang prevention, and reentry support. Fact, Trump and Republicans slashed grants to organizations like the National Organization for Victim Assistance, which trains advocates who staff domestic violence shelters, hotlines, and rape crisis centers.  Fact, they cut over 10 million dollars in funding to the National Policing Institute, a non-profit helping rural police departments reduce violent crime. Fact, this week Republicans are trying to gut PEPFAR, a life-saving program  that partners with nonprofits around the world and has saved more than 26 million lives. And let's not forget many of these cuts were laid out in Project 2025, a radical far-right playbook drafted by hyper-conservative nonprofits for the express purpose of dismantling the very government institutions and systems that serve the public good. Ironically, we even have one of the authors of Project 2025 here with us today.  So let's not pretend this is about non-profit accountability, because if it were, this committee would also be investigating the Conservative Partnership Institute, which has pushed anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ+, and anti-vaccine propaganda, and hosted efforts to challenge the 2020 election. Mind you, as we have these organizations that are pushing anti-vaccine propaganda, we know that measles has reached a 30-year high when measles had actually  been over and done with. But now that we don't believe in vaccines, now children are our targets, unfortunately. And yes, they are dying. The New Century Foundation, a white nationalist organization that somehow maintains its 501c3 status to launder hate speech,  through the language of intellectual inquiry. Or they would investigate Turning Point USA, which has been linked to organizers of the January 6th insurrection. But Republicans aren't talking about those groups because this isn't about accountability. It's about silencing organizations that challenge Republican power.  It's about targeting nonprofits that protect the very people this Trump-aligned movement continues to harm. These organizations are defending victims of unlawful actions. They're helping to combat global pandemics. They're supporting police departments when this very committee won't. They're working to build safer, healthier communities while Trump and his allies defund them to hand out tax breaks to billionaires. And maybe that's the real threat here. They're effective.  They get people off the streets, out of prison, and into opportunity. They educate people about injustice, and that apparently scares some folks more than any so-called radical agenda. Because the only thing truly radical about these nonprofits is their belief that human beings deserve dignity, opportunity, and equal protection under the law, values my Republican colleagues seem to have forgotten, along with love thy neighbor.  So instead of demonizing the groups trying to do right by our communities, maybe we should be asking how to support them, how to ensure taxpayer dollars reach the people who need them most, because this hearing should be about public safety, not political vendettas. Until that happens, these hearings are doing more harm than good.

Your testimony could be my testimony, and that demonstrates the bipartisan nature of  creating redundant supplies of critical minerals and rare earth elements, weaning ourselves off of the chokehold that China currently has, where we've watched them use their current export restrictions on rare earths in retaliation to some of the trade negotiations that President Trump's leading. We can't be dependent on that. And again, so with that, certainly thank you for this important hearing.  Creating and building a diversified, resilient, secure critical mineral supply chain is crucial to our national security. That's why landmark legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, in which Senator Manchin played a key role, led to historic investments to support domestic critical mineral supply chains and started to diversify us away from foreign entities of concern.  Unfortunately, in the big, beautiful bill, some of these demand incentives with regards to electric vehicles, battery manufacturing, et cetera, potentially are going to be undermined. And that's something that, you know, certainly as we look at implementation of this bill, I think we ought to correct to continue to build those demand signals. Also, while domestic production of critical minerals is crucial for the United States security, we can't do it alone if we want to shift away from reliance with China.  That's why our subcommittee is going to play an important role to make sure the State Department, the Development Finance Corporation, and other national security agencies have the tools they need to build resilient global supply chains. I've, you know, in the prior administration worked closely with the State Department, worked closely with Undersecretary Fernandez.  to build those strong international partnerships on supply chain resilience, both bilaterally and through multilaterally initiatives, including the Mineral Security Partnership. The MSP brings together 14 partner countries, including Australia, India, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.  as well as the European Union to strengthen critical mineral supply chains. The MSP Finance Network convenes development finance institutions like the DFC and its equivalents in the MSP partner nations to leverage private sector investment for critical mineral projects, focusing on minerals that are most relevant for advanced technologies, defense, energy, and industrial processes. It's a positive sign that our ally, South Korea,  has now succeeded the United States as chair of the MSP. That said, we've got to continue to work with the State Department and continue its robust leadership in the MSP to ensure that MSP projects are meeting our national security goals. That's why today I've introduced the Bipartisan Mineral Security Partnership Authorization Act with my colleague Chairwoman Kim and Representative Moylan to authorize the State Department to lead the U.S. participation in the MSP.  As our committee works to pass bills, including reauthorizations of the Development Finance Corporation and State Department, it's critical that we work in a bipartisan nature to ensure that we have clear international strategy for securing critical mineral supply chains. The MSP is central to the State Department's role in this strategy, and I look forward to hearing our witnesses' suggestions on how we can strengthen the MSP to be more expansive. With that, I look forward to hearing the testimony from the witnesses, and I'll yield back."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker highlights the bipartisan nature of the issue and the need to create redundant supplies of critical minerals and rare earth elements.

And we're going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build. And then we're going to make it a very high tariff because  We gotta move them in.

Mr. Walz, as you know, the United Nations has become a hotbed of anti-Semitism.  a hotbed of anti-Israeli sentiment. U.N. employees participated in the October 7th attacks, and Israeli hostages were held at U.N. facilities for months.

There's indications that the World Health Organization and its hospitals, they knew that tunnels were being built underneath and knew that these hospitals were being used. I, and I have some of our veterans with you, have literally been shot at by terrorists hiding behind women and hiding behind children and for Hamas to literally line the walls  of its hideouts with hostages to protect its leadership is atrocious and it should be called out at every turn. Yet, we just had to veto a resolution in the Security Council that went after Israel in what is absolutely a horrific war and didn't even mention Hamas.  and certainly didn't mention the fact that its leaders deliberately sacrifice, as a matter of strategy and tactics, deliberately sacrifice their own people.  in order to turn world opinion against Israel. So I think probably the easiest way to answer your question is sunlight is often the best disinfectant, and to continue to spotlight it and use not only the platform that is this position, but I think one of the best communicators in the world, which is President Trump, Secretary Rubio, and the leadership in this administration to continue to call it out."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 196.304, "text": " Mr. Walls, thank you, and I'm grateful that you have moral clarity on this important issue.

Much of those resources are untapped, and the region could be a valuable new partner for energy exports to Europe. The UN, unfortunately, has pushed Central Asian countries to only adopt really a radical green agenda instead of more a balanced approach of all the above energy  these radical green development goals could hinder the growth and success of developing countries like we see in Central Asia.
