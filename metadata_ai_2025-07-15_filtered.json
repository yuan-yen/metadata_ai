You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes, then it's easier to stop them. And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language. I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. I know Putin very well from the days when I was prime minister. And then once you have to test him, and you did this, and you really gave him a chance to be serious, to get to the table.  Well, as we told you at the top of the program, President Trump is sending additional weapons to NATO countries for distribution to Ukraine. It's part of his effort to try to end the war with Russia. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was on hand for that announcement, as you saw in the Oval Office. He joins us on set tonight. Mr. Secretary General, thanks for being here. Good to be on the program. What's your takeaway from your meeting today and that announcement and how significant it is?  This is really significant. So last Thursday, I got a call from President Trump. He said, hey, Mark, we really want to ramp up the support for Ukraine when it comes to weapons. And then this morning, I was in the White House preparing for the meeting with him. And he said, when it comes to the sanctions, clearly, we have to take the next step now. And he can only dialogue once. So he has to take this step by step. I totally understand that.  But he was really, I think, irritated with his last phone call with Putin, who is not serious, it seems, about getting into peace negotiations. So now there's a 50-day deadline. Essentially, the president put that on the table today. And you think that the sanctions on other countries doing deals with Russia will create additional pressure, exponential?  Absolutely. This is significant. So today if you are in Beijing or in Delhi or you're in Brazil and you know that this is coming to you, you might want to call Vladimir or Vladimir Putin and say, hey friend, we are still buying stuff from you, but you have got to get serious when it comes to these negotiations on a ceasefire or a peace deal, or otherwise we get hit by these secondary sanctions. There will be also an effect directly on Russia, of course.  But this is really significant. And it is smartly designed by the president. What about the weapons themselves? Why not the U.S. directly to Kiev? Why through European countries? Well, there are two sides to this. One is the logistics. And NATO is good at logistics. So get the weapons into Ukraine in a way that they can make maximum use of them. So packaged in packages which are really useful. And for them to be maximum effective. And then, of course, is the issue of who is paying for it. And the president  And I totally understand this. He said, hey, listen, Mark, we want to deliver these weapons into Ukraine, making sure that they can sustain in the fight, that they somehow are able to defend themselves against the Russians. But you guys in Europe have to pay for it. And I think that's fair. We had the NATO summit, which was a huge foreign policy success for President Trump. Europeans stepping up. And here again, the Europeans are stepping up, taking responsibility to pay for these weapons.  You know, Vladimir Putin has shown no indication he's going to stop this. And obviously, you've talked to the president about how much these phone calls have irritated him. We have this chart that shows the number of attacks, drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, sometimes right after these phone calls going up. So what is it going to take? How much more support for Ukraine to get to the table?  negotiating table to push Russia to that point.  Putin now hears from the American President and from the Europeans is that we will do whatever it takes for Ukraine to be as strong as possible when peace deal is taking place or peace negotiations will start to be in the best possible place at that moment. And then on top of that,  the threat of sanctions in 50 days on those who are still buying, like Brazil, India and China, from Russia. So if I was in the Kremlin today, I would not be too happy. Because this is a clear signal that President Trump is serious. He wants peace. He hates the fact that so many people lose their lives in Ukraine.  You mentioned the NATO political success for President Trump. The New York Times writes it this way. Since his first term, Mr. Trump has been pressing for the Allies to spend more on their own defense. After one day meeting in the Netherlands, they agreed to raise their spending on the military to 5% of their national income by 2035. The amount consists of 3.5% on traditional military needs, like troops, weapons, shells, and missiles, up sharply from the current target  of 2%. I mean, describe that for the layperson in America, how big a deal that is, that shift. It really started in the first term with President Trump, but now in this moment. The direct impact, if I was living in America, is more jobs for the middle class. Because this will mean more production lines, more shifts in the great defense industrial base here in the US. Of course, the same in Europe, because we need the defense industrial base across the alliance, from Turkey up to and including California. Well, it will mean more jobs for the middle class in the US.  President Trump was pushing Europeans to get to this famous 2% which was the old target at the beginning of this year. Seven, eight countries were still not on that 2% and they all came in before the summit in The Hague. Spain was not there. Also Spain committed to the 2%.  But now 5% is a little too much for them. They are saying we can get there on a lower percentage. Absolutely not true. They will not be able to do that. They will need to spend the 5%. But OK, we said you show us you can do it for a smaller amount of money, but you will never be able to do that. That's clear. But all 32% have committed to this 5% and to their target.  I think one of the biggest foreign policy successes of President Trump. And it also means that NATO is reinvigorated because it is fairer, we spend the same as the Americans are spending on the European side, and we need it to keep ourselves safe from Russia, which is investing in its defence at a staggering rate.  You said that the US is not secure if the Atlantic, Europe, and the Arctic are not secured. There's an increasing realization, and let's not be naive about it, if Xi Jinping would attack Taiwan, he would first make sure that he makes a call to his very junior partner in all of this, Vladimir Putin, residing in Moscow, and telling him, hey, I'm going to do this, and I need you to keep them busy in Europe by attacking NATO territory. So you see this all linked.  together. And most policy experts see this all linked. Because there was always the thinking the Chinese might attack Taiwan as a sort of isolated incident, which is, by the way, of course, big enough by itself. But it is clear that China is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine together with North Korea and Iran. So this is North Korea, China, Iran working together with the Russians.  And China is doing that for a reason. It gives them leverage over, indeed, their very junior partner, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. And clearly, if they would move on Taiwan, they will force Putin to move on Europe. And for the U.S., NATO is there because, of course, you want Europe to be safe, but in the first place, also, because the U.S. has to stay safe. And therefore, you need a safe and secure Atlantic, Arctic, and Europe. How is President Trump seen around the world by world leaders you deal with?  I think he is very well respected. And I saw in The Hague, at the summit, 31 leaders. So the 32nd, of course, is the US. In itself, by the way, bigger than all the other 31 combined. That is how powerful this country is and this nation is in your military. But the other 31 leaders really recognizing, hey, this is somebody who is absolutely clear what he wants to achieve, is committed to NATO, but he is extremely frustrated about the fact that we are not paying up. And now we are paying up. And therefore, this commitment to NATO is ironclad.  You raised some eyebrows when you used the term daddy."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 467.99, "text": "Yeah."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 468.11, "text": "I probably should have said father or the grown-up in the room. But you know, this is the fun part about President Trump. He came back to the White House, and immediately there was this video released, Daddy is Home. And you see the t-shirt with daddy on it. So he laughed about it. He laughs about it. And that is why I like him so much, because he has that humor and that light touch. And he's a great man. Mr. Secretary General, thanks for the time. Thank you so much. Good to be in the show.  We just watched major, major policy shift from President Trump, who spoke live from the Oval Office, joined by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The president announced he will be allowing Ukraine to purchase more American weapons, including Patriot defense missiles.  And the president tore into Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said, quote, he's very unhappy with Putin and threatened 100% tariffs on Russia if the peace deal is not agreed upon within 50 days. When asked 50 days, why that long? He said, it's really not a long time. I mean, think about it. 100% tariffs could be coming.  They could not sustain that with that economy. This is Outnumbered. I'm Harris Faulkner, here with my co-host, Emily Campagno. Also joining us today, Lisa Booth, Fox News political analyst, Alicia Acuna from the West Coast, Fox News senior correspondent, and Paul Morrow, Fox News contributor, attorney, and retired NYPD inspector and attorney. All right, so Alicia, we look at the situation. We've been covering this for 1,220 days.  So the idea of Ukraine getting crushed and needing more is not specifically new, but President Trump ran in part on saying he would end this. It's 157 days. It's not that long into his presidency, and he's given an ultimatum to a man he once described as having a good relationship with.  Yes, absolutely. And I also find it interesting, and Jackie Heinrich hit on this, that he said it didn't matter to him that the Senate, while it's doing its job and it's doing a good job considering the 500% tariffs on countries that do deals with Russia, right? He's got his own deal going on as well, with 100% tariffs on the table in 50 days. He made it very clear, we're going to hit them and we're going to hit them hard. Some of it's going to come from me, some of it could come from the Senate. But either way, you are dealing with me now.  And he also made it incredibly clear that you are no longer dealing with President Biden. Right. I think it's also important, Paul, that we not pay for this. And that seems to be critical because the president hit that point hard. Let's watch. I am with Russia, but we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with him and we're going to be  doing very severe tariffs. If we don't have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100 percent. You'd call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine. And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it.  And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin, because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago. But it doesn't seem to get there. Paul, $350 billion the U.S. has already spent on this war. And so he's saying no. You guys ponied up for your percentages at the G7 summit recently. That's how they'll get paid for."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 689.594, "text": " This is where Donald Trump's straight-talking rail politic really hits the ground, and it's something he doesn't get a lot of credit for, because the foreign policy intelligentsia, this is all ironed out on the campuses and among the academics, all the think tanks, and they see Donald Trump as some sort of unwashed, uneducated character or something because he doesn't speak their language. Why? Because he speaks plainly and he goes right to the truth. Trump is the first guy that we've seen relative to the Soviet Union, which is what Putin wants to reconstitute.  He's the first guy who's taken NATO back to first principles, which is, we're all in this together, guys. And we're not going to pony up all the money for all of the defense. We've created in Europe a series of defense junkies. And they're all sitting around. I've been over there. Wow.  They're sitting around saying, don't worry about it, guys. It's OK. Because you know what? America will send the 82nd Airborne, and we'll get out of this. Take the money and put it into whatever. And very clearly, that's gone away. And you have to say to yourself, where were our NATO ambassadors all of this time? Did nobody come back?  from Europe come back from The Hague and say, Mr. President, I've got to tell you something. They're all deadbeats. They won't even put up the 2% that they're supposed to put up. You mean with the last administration? Going back even further, the German politicians literally laughed at Donald Trump first time around when he said, you're going to all be beholden to Russian  oil. As far as the tariffs go, one thing I would just say we have to be cautious about. Russia loves to say we can survive anything with self-sufficient. They'll sacrifice a whole generation over there. And they are, right now, a wartime economy. A lot of people fear that if this gets resolved, he'll start another war just to keep his economy going. So right now, the Georgians, the people in the Baltics, they're all very concerned about the fact that if you end this one, we may have another one."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 795.029, "text": " So that's really interesting, Emily, because he doesn't share a border with Germany, but he's across the Baltic Sea from Germany. And the president just said, the country that is talking so strongly about what would happen if Russia doesn't come to a deal and back down is Germany. He said, I won't tell you what we would do, but they're very bold about what they would do. And I wonder if it's not that Baltic proximity that has Germany going, we're also the ones with the most weaponry.  weaponry, rather, so on and so forth. What's your take? Yeah, I think that's why we sort of saw today the signal of this, like, hard-lined renaissance happening in the approach, and the whole point is that this is going to test the allied cohesion, indeed, absolutely that, and then the real impact of economic pressure.  To that point, will it actually work, or will Putin just spin out and start other wars? I thought what was interesting is that as we tip into this next phase, so we have military support for Ukraine. It's structured around financial accountability, and then the stick is sanctions. But the whole point is we're going to see the barriers along the way, the challenges. Do the allies have budgets? Germany has said, we are going to spend a lot.  At a certain point, there's obviously a finite end. Will the tariff timeline hold? Diplomacy with Russia may falter under inflexibility, obviously, because look at what Trump mentioned. We talk on the phone, everything's cool, and then he goes ahead and bombs everyone. So there's not a lot of predictability with that model.  predict with any type of confidence what the other person's going to do. And then I think there might be domestic criticism in just that it might undermine global diplomacy, the argument goes, and then obviously with China weighing in. So I think this is a test, but I know I have my money on the president because he won't falter.  The wild card is Putin. So the politics of this, you know, I mean, what Emily's talking about is true. It's what's going on at home and potentially what kind of pressure that can put on a deal or the president. So we know the United Senate and House can put on their 500 percent tariffs on the countries that do business with Russia. And the president said, well, Senator John Thune's coming over and we're going to talk about that. Now, I assume he means to the White House.  coming over to his house right the people's house but on top of that he says I can do my own deal so that's what you were talking about Alicia and he said and I could put that up to a hundred percent so if if people can't afford to do business with them and they can't afford to do business with us where are they gonna get their stuff  Well, I also think it's smart politically for President Trump to remove us slightly from saying, look, NATO's going to buy these weapons and then distribute them. We're not doing it. And that's also where you see President Trump not just the commander in chief, but the business guy, right? He's always looking out for the bottom line of Americans, with they're going to buy these weapons, getting Ukraine to sign a minerals deal, getting NATO to pay more, increase their spending by 5%.  So we see the business guy in President Trump. Look, I have concerns similar to what Paul expressed about, is this war never ending with Russia and Ukraine? Will it ever end? Russia has a larger military. They have more people to sacrifice at the altar of this war. However, I think President Trump deserves our deference. He's always right. When has he been wrong about foreign policy? His naysayers are the ones. Everyone said there was going to be a World War III.  after, you know, sending those bombs to Iran and taking out some of their nuclear facilities, or at least badly damaging them, that didn't come to fruition, right? So he's repeatedly been... Or, you know, moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Everyone was worried about that, right? So everyone has been wrong. He's always been right. So he deserves our deference. And then also, this is a guy who's really interested in peace, as he pointed out, ending that 30-year war between Congo and Rwanda, which he doesn't get any credit for. So, you know, look, I'm gonna wait and see on this, but I think he has earned our respect.  And he's earned our deference, because he has repeatedly been right, and his naysayers are wrong. Well, look, in India and Pakistan, that we're ready to have a hot war. He ended that in a weekend. Look, real quickly, because I think this is worth knowing. Patriot missiles in certain countries as of 2022. So who else has these, right? So some of them are in NATO, some of them are not. The US, obviously, the Netherlands, which for 14 years, Ruda was their prime minister, so we know that.  We can get a good count on them there. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been going around and calculating where all these things are. Germany has them, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Bahrain, and Switzerland. Just to give an idea of where there are other Patriot missile systems, because that comes into play some of those countries in NATO. Your last quick thought."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1072.066, "text": " I'm heartened to see Poland there. Look, when I talk about Europe in terms of defense spending and defense posture, I don't mean Eastern Europe, because their proximity to Russia means that they can't afford to be overly idealistic and burn their money on green new deals and stuff like that. There are some very tough characters over there. They got it at the end of World War II. That's not that long ago in geopolitical time.  And we have to essentially return to a 19, whatever it would be, 1950 posture or so, in the era when you had Khrushchev banging his shoe on the table saying, we will bury you.

John, let's bring in Dan Hoffman now, Fox News contributor and former CIA station chief in Moscow. Thank you very much for being here, Dan. First up, I mean, how concerned are you about this new and seems to be growing assassination threat from Iran against President Trump?"}, {"keywords": [], "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1128.884, "text": " Well, I think you definitely have to be concerned. Iran has threatened former National Security Advisor John Bolton, as well as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as President Trump. But I also believe that the timing of this alleged crowdfunding and overt threat against the president is deliberate. The United States, with our kinetic strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, re-established escalation dominance.  And Iran, I think, is seeking to gain some leverage to demonstrate that they could potentially hurt us in anticipation of nuclear discussions with us, negotiations over the future of their nuclear program. They don't have any other leverage. We've eliminated that. Israel has destroyed Iran's proxy terrorist network, as well as their air defenses. And we have the upper hand. And I think that's why we're seeing this threat.  I expect President Trump to be working closely with law enforcement as well as the intelligence community just to learn more details about how serious this threat is. But again, we have to be very, very vigilant."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1190.36, "text": " It sounds like that is the case. U.S. Secret Service did pass along a statement to Fox, and it reads, in part, quote, we operate in a heightened and very dynamic threat environment, and the safety and security of the president and all of our protectees remains our highest priority. To preserve operational integrity, we can't comment on specific protective intelligence matters.  However, our teams work around the clock with international, federal, state, and local partners to ensure the highest levels of protection. But to your point, Dan, this was a senior State Department official, an official statement from the State Department on this as well, saying a senior State Department official is telling the Washington Free Beacon that the Trump administration is aware of these threats and committed to, quote, holding bad actors accountable. This means using  every tool at our disposal, including sanctions, to implement the president's maximum pressure strategy. We're learning about this blood covenant, Dan, obviously at the same time that President Trump says he's hopeful of a ceasefire in these talks between Israel and Hamas potentially happening this week. How hopeful are you?"}, {"keywords": [], "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1258.383, "text": " So first of all, just to reiterate something that you highlighted in the previous segment with Tom Holman, you shouldn't be just playing defense. You've got to go on offense. So it doesn't mean that the United States won't seek to disrupt these threats. And I'm sure that we're mounting a full court press to do just that. When it comes to an Israel deal with Hamas, it's possible. But Hamas wants Israel out of the Gaza Strip, and they want a permanent ceasefire. Israel's not willing to do that.  We also don't know what the Gaza Strip is going to look like, what the day after looks like. Israel wants to ensure that there could be no future terrorist threat emanating from Gaza against Israel. And so what I expect is it's possible, through very intense diplomacy from the Trump administration, that we may arrive at some middle ground where we have a short-term ceasefire for 30 or 60 days.  a prisoner exchange where Israel releases perhaps as many as 1,000 Palestinians in return for some of the hostages who are still alive."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1320.1, "text": "This also, before I let you go, as the administration seems to be cranking up pressure on Russia, teasing this major statement or announcement, Dan, today as these drone strikes hit Ukraine, I just want to roll this on President Trump earlier on how he will respond if Putin escalates.

That's important because  Some of those countries who import Russian uranium and gas and oil, that would be China, for example, and India may be in a position to influence Vladimir Putin's decision-making over the next 50 days.

Thank you so much, Dan. Let's bring in now the United States Ambassador to NATO, Matt Whitaker. Thank you very much, Matt, for being here. This was President Trump, more from him, Satwan guys, on this deal. This was in the Oval Office. You were there on this weapons deal to Ukraine. More details, listen.  We've made a deal today where we're going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. The United States will not be having any payment made. We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it and they're going to be paying for it. So what do you want people to know about this deal?  Well, I think it's very important to know, first of all, the days of the United States sending unlimited taxpayer dollars to defend Ukraine are over. President Trump has made a very smart decision, an agreement with NATO, which says  Europe and Canada will pay for the weapons. The United States will manufacture them. Obviously, we make the best weapons systems in the world, and everyone wants them. And we're going to prioritize those going to Ukraine. And what this says also to Vladimir Putin, I think, is very loud and clear, which is, you know, we've given you a chance for peace. President Trump is a peacemaker. But if you want war, we will arm Ukraine, and Europe will pay for it.  It's actually, I think, a great step in ultimately bringing this war to a conclusion, to an end. In the last 18 months, Russia has gained about 1% of Ukrainian land. I mean, they're making no success. They're losing thousands of soldiers every single day. And way too many private citizens in Ukraine and the big cities are being injured. So I think this is a great next step  and finally ending this war. But again, if Vladimir Putin wants to continue to fight on the battlefields of Ukraine, the United States of America will sell Europe armaments so that they can be used by Ukraine to defend themselves. Matt, like his predecessor, Jens Stoltenberg, Mark Rutte appears to be a big fan of the president. Here's what he said after the announcement.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia. But you don't want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit.  I mean, this changes the status quo quite dramatically. It used to be that the Europeans would like to have Ukraine have weapons, but they were very happy to have the United States pay for it. Now they're ponying up for it. So that's different. But how also do you think Putin's going to react to this?  Well obviously he's going to react to not only the United States weapons being readily available to the Ukrainians at Europe's expense. He's also going to respond obviously to this tariff and especially as the people that are enabling of China India and others that are buying his oil. But you know this is a natural progression of what we did in the Hague at the NATO summit too. You know we obviously we  We move the burden off the American taxpayer for European defense and on to European taxpayers, where it should be. And the traditional defense of Europe is now going to be borne by the European population. And at the same time, we're doing the same thing with the Ukrainian war. You know, President Trump said today $350 billion of American taxpayers' money has gone to support Ukraine. No longer. But at the same time, we're not cutting them off from weapons, and we're also  also not making the United States of America less secure. We're going to make sure that strategically we have enough that we need and then anything else that we can make, manufacture and sell to our European allies and give to Ukraine I think is a perfect and elegant solution for this.  And now there's this idea of secondary tariffs, 50-day deadline. This may be the leverage that President Trump thinks he has with Vladimir Putin in Russia. And to John's point about this relationship with the NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, President Trump has spoken very highly of their relationship in the past. Here's just more of a sampling from the Oval Office, an exchange on this war, and it just keeps going on and on. Listen.  I felt, I don't know about you, Mark, but I felt that we had a deal about four times. And here we are, still talking about it. And he didn't send serious people to the negotiations. We thought, and I thought, we should have had a deal done a long time ago. But it just keeps going on and on.  Feel free to weigh in on that, Matt, but also having been in that Oval Office when all of this was going down, how important is it that they really seem to have developed a very strong relationship, the two of them?  Yeah, and obviously, Secretary, General Secretary Rutte is a very good politician. He was 14 years as the Dutch prime minister, and he knows how European politics works, and he can obviously bring people to the table in Europe. Obviously, President Trump is the master dealmaker, and I think he saw an opportunity here to not only, you know, bring jobs to middle America through making weapons systems. You know, I've seen some of those manufacturing  the U.S.  And I look, you know, every day that I work with him is enjoyable because he's such a professional and he is equally working hard to make NATO strong and make, most importantly, Europe strong. Because President Trump said it today when we were talking to him. And that is, is that a Europe, a strong Europe, a Europe that can deter Russia, frees up the United States to address all of our strategic concerns across the globe. And that's a good thing for everyone.  I mean, it is so interesting to see opponents of the president whining about him, insisting that NATO nations pony up and do their share. But the people who seem to like it are the people who are running NATO. Matt, great to catch up with you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Matt. Thank you. Meantime, senior White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich was at today's event in the Oval Office. She starts us off inside the White House briefing room. Good evening, Jackie.  Good evening, Brett. The president, who sharply criticized past assistance to Ukraine, often calling Zelensky a salesman, insulated himself from criticism over this policy shift, emphasizing that he's authorizing the sale of U.S. weapons to NATO allies, whose leaders he also praised after they stepped up their defense commitments. We had a deal about four times.  President Trump is stepping up Ukraine's defenses with billions of dollars worth of US weapons bought and distributed by NATO allies. Trump now fed up with Putin's games. My conversations with him are always very pleasant. When I tell the first lady, you know, I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation. She said, oh, really?  Another city was just hit. So it's like, look, he's, I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. Trump also giving Putin 50 days to reach a deal or face 100% secondary sanctions on any country doing business with Russia, a hefty consequence for major purchasers of Russian oil like China and India. The package is separate from the 500% secondary sanctions leaders in the Senate and House have been withholding for Trump's green light.  I'm not sure we need it, but it's certainly good that they're doing it. And I think they've actually crafted a pretty good piece of legislation that's probably going to pass very easily, and that includes Democrats. The president said Ukraine should begin receiving Patriot missile systems within days, replacements now heading to NATO countries as soon as this afternoon, a major development after the Pentagon briefly paused arms deliveries for a stockpile review early this month, an apparent surprise to the president. So who ordered the pause last week?  I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Trump indicated today this impending deal played a role. I knew what Pete was doing was evaluation because we knew this was going to happen. Obviously, that has a big impact on, you know, when you say a pause. Obviously, you're not going to be doing things if you don't know what's going to happen here. But we were pretty sure this was going to happen, so we did a little bit of a pause.  A White House official tells Fox the president ordered a review of U.S. stockpiles following the Iran strikes, and Pentagon officials believed that they were adhering to the president's wishes when they paused those arms deliveries for the purposes of that review, but there was no broader policy decision to pause military aid to Ukraine. Brett.  Jack Hanrak, live in the White House Briefing Room. Jackie, thank you. You think that the sanctions on other countries doing deals with Russia will create additional pressure, exponential? Absolutely. This is significant. So today, if you are in Beijing, or in Delhi, or you're in Brazil, and you know that this is coming to you, you might want to call Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and say, hey, friend, we are still buying stuff from you. But you have got to get serious when it comes to these negotiations on a ceasefire or a peace deal. Or otherwise, we get hit.  by the secondary sanctions.  President Trump stepping up the pressure there. You see the NATO Secretary General on set. Axios writes it this way, Trump to supply missiles to Ukraine gives Russia a 50-day ultimatum. This is a seismic policy shift from President Trump, who originally refused to side with Ukraine and until very recently insisted he would only supply defensive weapons so as not to escalate the war. Trump also said he was giving Russia 50 days to make a deal or else face 100% secondary tariffs, seemingly referring to a plan to impose tariffs on countries like China and India.  that by Russian oil, that would have a major impact on global oil markets. With that, let's bring in our panel, Fox News contributor Mary Catherine Hamm, Dasha Burns, White House Bureau Chief for Politico, and Guy Benson, also a Fox News contributor. All right, Mary Catherine, seems like it is a big turning point and may make a big difference.  Yeah, I went back to 2018 actually to reflect on how we got here when Trump first went to NATO and five countries were committing 2% at that point. And now you've got this big shift that the Secretary General noted with everybody but Spain saying we can get to 5%. And I think that's interesting because I was a person who back then thought, was worried about his rhetoric on NATO and who still worries about his rhetoric on Ukraine and Russia. But he has created a situation where he can do this deal that puts pressure on  Putin, because I think he feels like he's been worked over a little bit in that area. And he can do it in a way that is politically fine for him to do, even with his base, because Europe is paying for it, and strategically helpful to Ukraine, which is what I'm looking for. Yeah. Dasha, it is a change for this White House in positioning. And the question is, what happens after the 50 days? Does he agree to this Lindsey Graham bipartisan bill to put the pressure on, or does he do it himself?  Well, I just spoke to a senior White House official about just that, Brett. And the point here is I asked whether the shift was due to something. Did Putin say something? Did something happen? And they said, no, look, it's just time. And Russia at this point is now committing some of the worst atrocities against civilians of this entire war. And Trump feels like he's been tapped along by Putin. At the same time, Trump does feel like  Putin is the bigger fish with the upper hand here, and so he doesn't want to go full blunt force trauma against Russia right away, which is why we've really seen him hedge on this idea of sanctions. What I know is behind the scenes, the White House is very much in contact with Lindsey Graham about this, but they want the language change to give Trump the ultimate say, to give him the maximum optionality so that it's on the table, he can threaten Putin with it, but if Putin comes to the negotiating table in full good faith, then maybe it's a different story.  You know, the NATO Secretary General said the president gave Putin chances on multiple phone calls, but then noticed the attacks that came right after those phone calls as an affront to him and to the thought that he's going to get to the table. And he, frankly, was angry about it."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2156.283, "text": "Yeah. I think the NATO chief, to make this point, is very good. He's very smooth and not in a smarmy way.

Especially when you think about elitists in Europe, right? The default setting has been vis-a-vis President Trump. Smug, condescension, sneering. And the NATO chief, the Secretary General, has completely rejected that, and wouldn't you  Wouldn't you guess it?

There's a MAGA rebellion over the Epstein outcry. The split over Epstein represents one of the biggest rifts within the Trump supporters since the president took office for a second term. On one side are MAGA supporters who push claims that Epstein was murdered in his jail cell and that the disgraced financier had kept a list of high-profile clients. But Trump's DOJ and FBI have concluded that there's no evidence for either. Mary Catherine.  Yeah, I think there's a couple things going on here. Many, many, many people look at this and go, on its face, it looks like it was handled at least incompetently, if not corruptly, from day one, regardless of leadership. And they want answers because there are real victims who we will probably never know much about because they signed NDAs and because very powerful people were involved.  And also, there was an easy answer for the Trump administration here, which was, Ghislaine Maxwell is appealing. We cannot release anything while that is ongoing, right? I think that would have been the clean answer. Now they're in this situation where a bunch of people are deeply invested in this particular story, which there may be plenty more to, as a decoder ring for all that is corrupt in government. And if they don't get answers on that, they'll be very mad. Here's the other thing, though. There's a large portion of that portion of the base that will listen to Trump when they give him, when he gives them an answer on this.  And the question is, how politically salient is that? And does he have the benefit of the doubt?  Here's the tension. The White House wants to move on from this. One senior official tells me that they understand it's important to the base, and that doesn't mean they're going to ignore it, but they want to move past it. They also feel like this is very much an online kind of outrage, not that the issue is not important to the base, but that the outcry and the rage factor is very much an online thing led by these influencers. But the reality of it is that the people in Middle America that voted for Trump  are not as invested in this as they are in the economy and health care. The other piece of it is, the more that this administration doesn't want to talk about this, the more that online group wants to talk about it and shout about it and feels like there's more of a there there.

Russia is, to use the late Senator John McCain's expression, is basically a big gas station. They are a petrostate.  And they are running out of places they can sell their oil.

And something that's very interesting is that Biden's use of the auto pen stems far back into the early days of his presidency, whenever he was signing proclamations at first. It really wasn't until, I believe, the first year of his presidency, I believe on a trip to Israel where he used the auto pen  kind of as it is usually intended for, which is to sign legislation while you're away from the office. But as it turns out, we began to see later into Biden's presidency, there were days whenever he was even at the White House,  where he was having the auto pen being signed. That's according to information that's been obtained and released from the Oversight Project, formerly part of the Heritage Foundation, but they uncovered on at least seven different occasions. There were times whenever Biden was working at the Oval Office, but he still had things signed with auto pen. Therein lies where Republicans start to get suspicious because they think to themselves, kind of like we were just mentioning before, if it's supposed to be something that is convenient and for ease,  Well, one can make also an argument that it's just as easy to use your own hand to sign a signature on something, especially if you're at work that day. So I think that that's where people start, especially Republicans, start to look at the issue and wonder to themselves, was there something else happening here? Were there more aides that were doing this, perhaps unbeknownst to the president? And I think that that's where, especially Republicans like, say in Comer's camp,  want to see the Justice Department look into this as well. And I'll say this, you know, last week, whenever we saw Biden's doctor plead the fifth, there was a bit of a discussion about whether I remember Mike Lee, Senator Mike Lee from Utah was asking, why don't we just give Biden's doctor immunity if he's going to plead the fifth?

OK, we want to head to Texas now, where there are new concerns as heavy rains threaten to bring more flooding to the areas hardest hit by those recent deadly storms. This as new reporting reveals details about the response to the floods at Camp Mystic, where dozens tragically lost their life. NBC's Morgan Chesky has more.  Tonight, dangerous downpours threatening the Texas Hill Country, with flood watches covering areas in recovery mode. The death toll statewide from the flooding, now more than 130 people, as new details emerge about the crucial moments the waters rose.  at 1.14 a.m. on July 4th. A family spokesman tells NBC News Dick Eastland, the owner of Camp Mystic, received a National Weather Service alert on his cell phone. The spokesman says Eastland then walked outside to assess the property, called family on walkie-talkies, and between 2 and 2.30 a.m., staff began moving campers to the Mystic Rec Hall. Eastland later died in the floods.  Following the tragic loss of life, growing scrutiny over the lack of warnings from officials, who are the only ones able to tell residents to evacuate or shelter in place. It wasn't like a tornado. It wasn't like a hurricane even. It lasted all day. We asked Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice on who has authority to issue alerts at a city level.  What person would that be? So ultimately, it's me. Ultimately, I have the ultimate authority to be able to make those decisions based on that. Rice adding he was managing rescues and says other local officials can also blast out citywide warnings. Did you issue one? Yeah. So I did not. But that does not mean that something did or did not get issued. I don't know. We haven't dove into looking at the after action stuff. Officials say full reviews are still coming. Until then, the search for the missing, now in its second week.  These divers clearing off debris above before scouring the murky depths below. A painstaking process for closure that may never come. And Morgan joins us tonight live from Kerrville, Texas. Morgan, what do those flood warnings tonight mean for the search and recovery effort?  Yeah, Tom, well, authorities have said that volunteers needed to vacate this river area because the levels are still high. They're telling all of those individuals to stay on higher ground. But as for the search and rescue crews or recovery crews, unfortunately, you can see they are still absolutely in this river, even though that there are hazards beneath the water here, Tom. They have been scouring this stretch of the riverbank here on the Guadalupe. And unfortunately, Tom, with more rain in the forecast, that could pose an issue for them.  But just a testament to their tireless work. And you have yet another helicopter flying up above us. Tom, it feels like this has really been a nonstop effort since this flood began, now 11 days ago here. Unfortunately, that number missing, not dropping as fast as families would like. But the one thing we continue to hear from these crews that are out on this river every single day is they're going to stay here as long as it takes to try to make that closure happen here. Tom?  All right, Morgan Chesky for us. Morgan, we thank you for that. I want to get right over to NBC New York meteorologist Violeta Yaas, who joins us tonight here on Top Stories. So it has been relentless for parts of Texas right now, and millions across the East Coast are at risk for flash floods. What are you tracking tonight?  It has been a very rough rush hour across the northeastern U.S. with torrential, slow-moving downpours now advancing across that I-95 corridor. You can see numerous flash flood warnings in effect. We're seeing not only that, but we've got flood watches in effect through this evening, impacting 46 million people. You can see that really includes that whole I-95 corridor. So we've been seeing this all afternoon long.  This is going to be the focus through the next couple of hours. It's not just the amount of rain, but the fact that these thunderstorms are very slow moving in a very densely populated area of the country, the most densely populated area. So this has been causing big issues as delays have been piling up here across some of our major airports, D.C., Baltimore, up through Philadelphia, Newark, LaGuardia and JFK as well. So very stormy afternoon.  We can expect potentially significant flooding here. That's going to be the bullseye area, unfortunately, from D.C. up through Philadelphia into the New York City area as well. In terms of how much rain we're talking, you can see a general injure or so, but locally in some of those heavier downpours.  We're talking totals on the order of three to five inches of rain, certainly enough to cause flooding, especially when you're talking about a short period of time. So expect very difficult travel here through the next several hours. It's certainly a situation where if you don't need to be heading out the door, you definitely don't want to do that. So very unsettled weather here through this evening, very heavy downpours in the forecast here, really through tonight before conditions start to improve as we head into tomorrow.  All right, Violeta, let's talk about the Gulf now and what's happening just off the east coast of Florida, but why we're tracking it tonight.  Yeah, I actually do have an update for you. We now have tropical disturbance at 93 L invest that essentially formalizes this as an area that we're going to be watching. Still hasn't developed into a tropical storm or anything like that, but conditions are going to be favorable through the next couple of days. So this is going to be tracking across Florida into the Gulf the next couple of days. So if it does intensify, this would become Dexter through the remainder of this week.  Now, the rainfall totals here, you can see on the order of three to five inches locally, even more from parts of central and southern Florida, extending right through the panhandle into the remainder of the Gulf States. So this is an area that does need to be on alert through the next couple of days. Is there enough room, enough time for this to sort of develop into something potentially deadly?  We do have some time for this to intensify. It's possible. It doesn't necessarily do so before tracking across Florida. But once this moves into the Gulf and we've seen this time and time again, those very warm water temperatures, conditions are favorable in this particular area for that intensification. So we'll need to watch out for that. But another thing we've seen through the last several years is that you don't want to get too hung up on the exact categorization because this is going to provide  very heavy rainfall, and the potential for flooding in all of these areas, regardless of whether or not it does formally intensify into a tropical storm eventually. All right, Violeta, yes, we thank you so much for being here tonight. In Washington, President Trump announcing a new plan to rearm Ukraine as Russia intensifies its attacks on the country.

Maggie joins us now live. Maggie, a couple questions for you. First, you mentioned that state trooper who was shot and injured. And then I was also thinking about what you just reported there at the end. How did he get all these weapons if he had these prior convictions? Tom, we know of one possibility. We talked about that protective order that reportedly an ex-girlfriend just filed here earlier this month. In it, she wrote, among the other factors that kind of tie to his escalating behavior, she said that he had broken into her home and stolen her guns  plural. Now, police were asked today whether or not they knew or could say whether where he got his weapons and they declined to do so.

All right, still ahead right here on Top Story, a dangerous and growing trend. Four kids busted for this in New York City subway surfing. Two of them just 12 years old. What happened to them when police caught up to them?  Plus, unreleased Beyonce music stolen during her Cowboy Carter tour, thieves breaking into an SUV, making off with unreleased music, concert plans, and more. But first, tonight, top stories, top moment, and one unexpected pizza delivery. Police in Tempe, Arizona say they arrested a delivery driver during a traffic stop. What happened next came as a shock to the customer waiting for her food. Take a look.  Yeah, the Grubhub delivery driver apparently arrested, bringing a whole new meaning to what these officers did, and that is to protect and serve. Get it? Okay, stay with us. We are back in just a moment.  Back now with Top Stories news feed. The Supreme Court today said President Donald Trump may proceed with his plans to carry out mass layoffs at the Department of Education in the latest win for the White House. The justice is lifting a lower court ruling that put an indefinite pause on Trump's plan while legal challenges play out.  Trump ordered mass layoffs at the department earlier this year, cutting its workforce in half. But lower courts have blocked that effort, noting that the education department was created by Congress in a scathing dissent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision, quote, indefensible. Here in New York City, four kids were spotted by police drones riding on top of train cars. It's a dangerous trend known as subway surfing. Two of the boys were only 12 years old.  hard to believe. Police boarded the train and all four kids were taken into custody. The incident comes after a 15-year-old boy was killed on July 4th while subway surfing. Police and MTA officials believe the practice has increased in recent years due to social media urging people not to glamorize it. Former Major League Baseball player Dan Serafini has been found guilty  of murdering his father-in-law and trying to murder his mother-in-law after a 2021 Tahoe area home ambush and shooting. The motive, according to the prosecution, was rooted in longstanding family tensions and financial disputes. Key testimony came from Serafini's wife, Erin Spore, who said she didn't believe the family's disagreements could lead her husband to commit murder. In addition to murder and attempted murder, Serafini was found guilty of first-degree burglary. His sentencing set for August 18th.  And police in Richmond Heights, Ohio, capturing the moment three women twerked on a cop cruiser, then using a facial recognition platform, they identified them. Take a look at this. So dash cam video shows a woman climbing onto the car with others. Later joining police say the brazen act, which involved this type of dancing you see here, happened back in June. It damaged the vehicles because of that twerking with dents and scratches. A detective telling us with the use of Clearview AI facial recognition, they were able to identify  to identify two of the women who were twerking. Warrants are out for their arrest. They're still searching for a third. Okay, and a paraglider making it out unscathed after a run-in with a power line in North Dakota. This is pretty incredible. The paraglider flying steadily until you see this coming in close with those power lines, setting off the sparks, then plunges into the Red River. Crews are able to rescue the paraglider, helping him to get to shore. Thankfully, he was unharmed. Incredible he survived that. Okay, to Atlanta now in a major theft.  music world. Atlanta police say hard drives containing unreleased Beyonce music were stolen during a car break-in last week. The hard drives also included footage plans for Queen B's show and future set lists. For more on this, I want to bring in NBC's Priscilla Thompson, a proud member of the Beehive. Priscilla, thank you for this. So talk to us more about the break-in. I mean, this could be pretty huge, especially if it is all of Beyonce's stuff and they end up putting it somewhere on the Internet.  Yeah, Tom, incredibly huge, especially for such a high profile celebrity as Beyonce. We have obtained the incident report that shows that this happened last Tuesday, just as she was kicking off her Atlanta leg of the Cowboy Carter tour. And it happened at Crog Street Market, which is this very popular food hall in Atlanta. Now, according to Beyonce's choreographer, Christopher Grant, and also a dancer, D'Andre Bleu, they pulled into this market at around eight o'clock at night  An hour later, they went out to the car, and they noticed that the window towards the trunk was damaged. And they found that two suitcases were missing. And inside those suitcases were hard drives that contained watermarked music, unreleased music, footage plans for past and future shows, and also set lists.  We know that in addition to all of those very important things to Beyonce, I'm sure there were also laptops, headphones, different kinds of electronics. So lots of questions about why that would have been left in a vehicle in a parking garage, but definitely not something that such a high profile celebrity would want to fall into the wrong hands. Yeah, no, I hear you. And Priscilla, do we think this was random or do we think that they were targeted, like they knew these people worked for Beyonce?  That is definitely the big question. Now, police have not said whether it was random or targeted. But what is interesting that, you know, a lot of folks have the Find My app that connects all of their Apple electronics. And so police were actually able to ping the headphones and the computers, and they sent out, like, multiple units to this area. We know that they interviewed a man in this area and that they were also looking at a vehicle that appeared to be moving as the items that they were tracking were also moving.  And what's more, there is video, police say, that this parking garage had video cameras. The entire incident was caught on video. We know that they took fingerprints at the garage. And police have said that they have issued a warrant for the arrest of the suspect. But they say that an I.D. is, quote, not yet available for release. So unclear if they have that identity and just aren't releasing it to the public yet. But, obviously, it comes as Beyonce is  probably about to take the stage any minute now for her final concert in Atlanta before the tour moves on. Tom? Yep. All right, Priscilla Thompson, we appreciate that reporting. Next tonight to Tesla's new legal battle over its autopilot driving system. A 2019 Florida case where a woman was killed when a Tesla crashed into her parked car, now at the center of a federal trial. The jury seated today must decide if the company bears responsibility for the fatal accident. NBC's George Solis has some of the details.  Tonight, Tesla on trial. In a first for Elon Musk's electric car company, Tesla will now have to defend itself before a federal jury against claims its driver assistance technology is to blame for a deadly 2019 crash in the Florida Keys. Those fateful moments caught on the Tesla's own cameras. In a lawsuit brought by the victim's family, the plaintiff's attorneys say the driver was using the electric car's autopilot, which failed to detect the substantial profile of the Chevy SUV parked at an intersection.  It goes on to say the vehicle struck the Tahoe at almost 70 miles per hour, causing it to violently rotate. The resulting collision claiming the life of 22 year old Nybel Benavides-Leon."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 47, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1910.611, "text": "Next thing that we knew was the police coming five in the morning just saying, you know, you little girl is not going to come home anymore."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 48, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1920.064, "text": "And seriously injuring her boyfriend, Dylan Angulo. I woke up in the hospital.  and I didn't know what happened to me. The aftermath also captured on police body cameras. The Tesla's driver admitting to taking his eyes off the road moments before the crash as he searched for his phone, according to court documents. The core of the case centering on whether Tesla is liable when its autopilot tech is involved in a crash and how it was marketed to drivers, according to the lawsuit.  In 2016, the company posting this video of a Tesla appearing to drive itself. The text on screen reading, the person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself. Today, the company warns that autopilot is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel. Tesla has denied responsibility for the 2019 crash. In a statement to NBC News, Tesla says in part, the crash had nothing to do with Tesla's autopilot technology,  Instead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cell phones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver. Tesla's autopilot system has faced legal challenges as recent as last year. In three separate California cases, Tesla either settled or was found not liable. Getting into the robo-taxi. The outcome could not only threaten Tesla's reputation, but also impact its self-driving footprint as it begins a push for robo-taxis nationally. Musk himself did not appear in the courtroom today.  All right, with that, George Solis joins us tonight from Miami. So, George, the jury already seated today. What do we know about the makeup of the jury, and how long do we expect this trial involving Tesla to last? Yeah, Tom, the jury was just elected in a couple of hours. It's made up of six women and three men, and some of them were weeded out during some of the questioning, saying they couldn't participate because of their feelings about Elon Musk. Others saying they were just supporters of Tesla and Elon. Now, this whole trial is expected to take about three weeks.  Tom. All right, George Solis first. George, thank you. Back here in New York City, a major announcement in the race for mayor. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo announcing he's still in the race after losing the Democratic primary, saying he will compete as a third party candidate in this November's general election. Cuomo releasing this video on X, making it official."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 49, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2054.478, "text": " As my grandfather used to say, when you get knocked down, learn the lesson and pick yourself back up and get in the game. And that is what I'm going to do. The fight to save our city isn't over. Only 13% of New Yorkers voted in the June primary. The general election is in November, and I am in it to win it."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 50, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2075.268, "text": " All right, to break down what this means for the mayor's race, I'm joined tonight by Kevin Fry, Washington correspondent at New York One. Kevin, thanks so much for being here. So Kevin, Cuomo just quoted his grandfather, learn the lesson, pick yourself up, and get back in the game. But he lost by double digits in the primary, so what lesson did he learn here?  It seems some of it comes down to tactics. Cuomo ran during this primary campaign what could be likened to essentially a Rose Garden strategy. Even though he wasn't the incumbent, he was certainly running as the former governor with basically universal name ID, whereas Zoran Mamdani was very much on the ground. It was a tactical campaign. He was out interacting with the public. And today in that video and in a statement that Cuomo sent out to his supporters, he basically said that he was not aggressive enough  in that early campaign. And so he seems to be trying to take on a different approach. The other thing that was notable in the comments that he made in that video is he talked about affordability, which was really the hallmark of the Mamdani campaign. It wasn't necessarily something that Cuomo made front and center of his. So is he adopting some of that language? That seems to be somewhat of the approach here.  Does he have a point, though? I mean, if only 12% of the voting electorate participated in that primary election, I mean, is there a chance? He's got a chance.  I mean, he comes in as basically the most well-known man in New York City, arguably, though Mamdani, if you look at some of the preliminary polling, and it's very preliminary, still has the edge here. The major foil for Cuomo is that he is seemingly fighting for the same pool of voters as some of the other unaffiliated candidates or third-party candidates that are in this race, including the sitting mayor, Eric Adams.  as well as a Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa. And so if they're all fighting for the same piece of the pie, that does give Mamdani, it seems, again, preliminary polling, but does give him certainly a lane where he can kind of fight for his own way to win this. And if you have so many candidates, you don't have to get 50% to win, you just need to have the most.  Yeah, let's talk about a controversy involving Mamdani right now. He's facing the past few weeks. He has said previously that he doesn't consider himself black or African-American, despite being born in Uganda and living there for years. And yet, the New York Times has learned through hacked documents shared with the paper, Mamdani identified as both Asian and African-American on an application to Columbia University. Mamdani, of course, put his Muslim faith and South Asian descent front and center in his campaign. How is this revelation playing with New Yorkers?  There certainly seems to be some voters that are saying this is a bit of a bridge too far, but this of course does come in as Mondani has faced criticism on various other fronts, including his lack of a desire, or at least a lack of willingness, to condemn, for example, the idea of globalize the Intifada. There are these various aspects of Mondani that some voters are clearly not very comfortable with. One of the things that he is trying to do right now, and he's doing this to some degree with some success,  is to basically get all of the mainstream front and center Democrats behind him as they go into now the general campaign. Whereas Cuomo had a lot of endorsements from, for example, labor unions and other groups during the primary, they're now lining up behind Mamdani.  One of the key folks to keep an eye on, at least that I'm watching here in Washington, is Congressman Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer. Jeffries is not yet endorsed, nor has Schumer, and Jeffries is set to have a conversation with Mamdani in person at the end of the week. Obviously, he is the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, could be Speaker of the House, depending on how some key races fall next year. When Mayor Eric Adams ran and won, he ran on crime. He's a former police officer. What is the top issue, you think, in this race?  At this point, at least it seems, and if anything you can take away from the primary, it seems that affordability is front and center. Whereas back in 2022 or 2020, what year is it now? 2021 rather, really front and center was we were coming out of the COVID pandemic. There was a peak in crime. And so part of Adams' successful message as a former member of the NYPD was I'm going to push back on crime.  Now we've kind of turned the corner on some of those crime rates, and it seems that the affordability crisis, the inability to afford rent, and so forth, might be really the defining mark for this race. It's going to be an interesting race, and there's a lot of months. I'm sure there'll be investigations and articles and a lot of opal research in that time. So great to have you on the show tonight, Kevin Frey. We appreciate it.  No problem, Tom. Elmo's World now causing controversy. The ex-account for the beloved Sesame Street character posting a string of racist and anti-Semitic comments over the weekend. Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind the popular children's show confirming Elmo's account, had been hacked.  NBC's Melanie Zenona has been following this for a while and joins me now. Melanie, thanks for joining Top Story tonight. I thought Elmo might be too young to be on X, but apparently not. He has an account. In all seriousness, though, break down this for us and also why this is so sad, right, for X.  Yeah, this all started on Sunday when Elmo's account began posting this very hateful and racist content. It also posted some derogatory comments about President Donald Trump in connection to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Now, we should know that NBC News was not able to independently verify these posts before they were deleted. But Sesame Workshop, that's the nonprofit behind Elmo and Sesame Street, did put out a statement confirming that the account was hacked, although it is still unclear at this point who was behind the hack. I want to read you part of their statement. They said,  Elmo's ex-account was compromised today by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including anti-Semitic and racist posts. We are working to restore full control of the account.\" And since that statement, it does appear that they have been able to regain control and secure that account. The posts were deleted. His bio, Elmo's bio, was restored. But this caused quite the nightmare on Sesame Street. A beloved Muppet in character  that really did, you know, he's done these other things in the past, gone viral for starting a mental health conversation, saying, Elmo checking in, how are you doing? So just a very sad sort of situation to see play out here. Yeah, those hackers are pretty heartless. I do want to ask you, this is sort of the second or third or fourth hate speech scandal to hit X in under a week, coming just days after Elon Musk's AI chatbot made a series of anti-Semitic posts which have since been deleted. Does Elon Musk or the team behind X show any signs of cracking down?  Well the AI company that's behind Grok did issue apology for what they called horrific behavior on the platform. The company also said they did conduct an internal investigation and they determined that the root cause was an update to the code path upstream of the Grok bot. However it isn't clear what additional measures or crackdowns they're going to take.  to prevent this from happening again. And this is not the first time that we've actually seen this type of hateful comments popping up on the GROK chat bot itself. And so there is also going to be a resignation we already saw from X, the CEO of X, stepping down. They also did introduce a new version of GROK, GROK4, right after  these alarming posts, but there are still calls for more accountability to prevent the platform from not only spreading this hate speech, but from providing it itself. Yeah, and before you go, Mellie, since we have you here, it's sort of in the same vein. All of this happening as the Senate is expected to vote this week on whether or not to take back funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports children's programming like Sesame Street. Is there any talk of a possible connection here to this?  Well, these cuts had actually been in the work for quite some time on Capitol Hill. Both PBS and NPR have been top targets of Trump, who's really pushing Congress to get this over the finish line and get it to its desk this week. But Tom, I got to tell you, there are Republicans who have concerns with this bill. There are Republicans like Susan Collins who have concerns with the cuts to foreign aid programs. And then you have other Republicans who are concerned with the cuts to PBS and NPR, which they say are crucial.  to providing not only news, but also weather alerts to rural areas, which, of course, is top of mind after those horrific floods in Texas last week. So we could see some changes to the bill. If that happens, though, it needs to go back to the House. And the time is ticking here because Congress has a deadline of needing to act by July 19th, which is Friday.  All right, Melanie, we thank you for having on Top Story tonight. Up next, what might be the strangest bust you'll ever hear about. German officials foiling a plan to smuggle 1,500 tarantulas into the country. And you won't believe where they found them. Plus, pediatricians sounding the alarm over nicotine poisonings in children. The number of kids getting sick from nicotine pouches and other products skyrocketing. What parents need to know. That's coming up right here on Top Story.  We're back now with Top Story's Global Watch, and we begin in South Korea, where officials there are ordering airlines operating Boeing aircraft to inspect fuel cutoff switches. The mandate comes amid safety concerns raised about the airplane parts after the deadly Air India crash. Officials have now provided a timeline for inspections. In 2018, the FAA recommended inspections of the switches on Boeing models, including the 787.  Officials in Germany foiled a plan to smuggle 1,500, get this, young tarantulas into the country inside sponge cake. The eight-legged venomous creatures were discovered in chocolate cake boxes shipped from Vietnam to Cologne's airport. Many of the spiders did not survive the trip. Those that did were given to an expert handler. Criminal proceedings have been filed against the intended recipient.  All right, and France celebrating its largest national holiday, Bastille Day, with festivities nationwide. In Paris, at least 7,000 marchers in a parade along the Champs-Elysees with horseback riders and armored vehicles. A drone show, I should say, happening over the Eiffel Tower and fireworks in nearly every city. The holiday marks the day Parisians stormed the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, sparking, of course, the French Revolution.  At a Top Stories health check and an urgent new warning for parents, the number of babies and toddlers with illnesses related to nicotine products has skyrocketed. A new study from the Medical Journal of Pediatrics say more than 130,000 cases of nicotine poisoning in kids under the age of six were recorded from 2010 to 2023. Most of the cases attributed to contact with products like  nicotine pouches and vape e-liquids. For more on what you can do to protect your kids from exposure and sickness, let's bring in NBC News Medical Contributor, Dr. Natalie Azar. Natalie, so great to see you. I want to give this stat to our viewers because this is one of the reasons why we're doing it. The number of nicotine poisoning shot up almost by seven, it shot up 763% in kids in just three years. So how are these kids ending up sick from nicotine and is it those zinc pouches that have become so popular?  Yeah, well, I mean, I agree, Tom, that I think we've seen a significant rise in the popularity of a lot of different products in lieu of people smoking cigarettes, including these nicotine pouches, as well as vapes. And they're almost really ubiquitous.  I think, you know, children are uniquely susceptible to toxicity from these, Tom, given simply their size. The average amount of nicotine that is contained, let's say, in a pouch of Zin, is anywhere from about one and a half to 15 milligrams of nicotine. But as little as one to two milligrams can be toxic to a toddler, as opposed to really a much, much higher amount that adults can tolerate before they can experience toxicity.  But I guess the big question is, Dr. Azar, why are kids getting into them? Is there something that these nicotine products now look like that they didn't look like before?  So kids have always been susceptible to putting things in their mouths that they shouldn't. You know, it's not necessarily that they're flavored. You know, we talk about that a lot with vaping and with teens. But I think it's just, it's something small lying around the house. Children are going to put that in their mouths quite simply. That can suck on them. It's exactly the right size or the wrong size, you know, for exposure if you have little ones in the house, Tom.  Dr. Azar, if your child does suffer from nicotine poisoning, what are some of the symptoms and do you call 911? Should you rush your child to the ER?  Yeah, so in the first couple of minutes after exposure, Tom, some of the symptoms could include sweating, agitation, nausea, vomiting, a high heart rate. But after that, that's when it gets kind of critical, where children can experience a drop in blood pressure, a drop in their heart rate, and even coma. And so if you ever are suspicious about any kind of exposure or ingestion of nicotine with those early signs or symptoms that I mentioned, you need to call 911 immediately.  All right, Dr. Azar, always a pleasure to have you on Top Story. We thank you so much. We learned a lot here. When Top Story returns, some hope in the midst of heartache.

Did you kill and murder Ethan Chapin, a human being? Yes.  Koberger recently pled guilty in a deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty and gave the parents the assurance he'll never be allowed to appeal. The Chapin spoke to NBC exclusively for the first time since that chilling confession. Was that your first time seeing Brian Koberger in person? Yes. What was that like? Honestly, I really didn't give it a thought, because it doesn't matter. It's done. It's just shocking, the wreckage that is that person.  Their focus now, remembering Ethan. His parents and triplet siblings, Maisie and Hunter, reflect on his life in a new Amazon Prime documentary, One Night in Idaho. Ethan was definitely like the leader. Like I would go to him and Hunter would go to him. We were raised very centered around family. So we were friends with everyone, but we were best friends with each other.  The family remembers their best friend by holding on to things he loved. Ethan's Jeep still parked in the garage. It was just so him. I mean, he even had the flag and the grill. In what ways do you feel Ethan's presence? Everywhere in this house.  I mean, he just could just blow into any room and had something funny to say.

Democrat Representative Jared Moskowitz trying to turn attention to a different controversy facing public broadcaster, posting, see what happens when you defund PBS?  The Senate is expected to vote this week on whether to take back $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds both NPR and PBS. Trump demanding Republicans defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting or risk losing his endorsement.

By the way, the Biden administration lost thousands of children that this administration is focused on finding with law enforcement operations like these. And there was also child predators and convicted murderers.  who were picked up in that operation as well. God bless the men and women of ICE. They are heroes. And they are great men and women who put on that uniform every day and deserve to go home safely to their families at night. And the Democrats who are allowing this violence to take place against them should be ashamed of themselves. And I know that the American people will firmly reject that position in the next election, just like they did in the previous election on November 5th, when they reelected President Trump and the Trump administration to seal our border  and deport illegal criminals from our homeland."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 475.822, "text": "We saw the reaction the president got at MetLife Stadium.

We are trying to develop close ties with India. We see India as a strong potential partner vis-a-vis China. And we've also been reticent in some ways to go after a number of Chinese banks and other Chinese entities. So I think, you know, with this tariff play, we'll see. It could have real ramifications, I think, for Russia's oil sector.  But it would also have real implications for the United States bilateral relations. And the thing we have to remember is part of what the Biden administration was trying to do was to keep Russian oil on the global market. We wanted Russia to take a haircut in terms of how much profit it was getting in terms of sales. But we didn't really have a problem with Russia selling oil. We just wanted to sell it at a haircut.  because we wanted Russian oil on the market to keep global prices low. The Trump administration, I think, is taking a bit more of a blunt approach.

So, you know, China does recognize that its oil dependence, its dependence on Russia as well as the Middle East, represents a real strategic vulnerability. It's part of the reason why they are going  a whole hog into renewables and clean technology. But for China, I think this could be really significant if the U.S. does impose this.

And the Saudis, I don't think were willing to. But with Trump, maybe it's different. I think the bigger, broader question here, though,  is that Trump has not shown a lot of interest in trying to really stick it to the Russians, economically or militarily. He has not demonstrated in the past a lot of support for Ukraine. If that is shifting, the question is how far does that shift? I think what we've seen is a partial shift,  The US now looks like it's going to continue military supplies. But there's no indication Trump is going to go to Congress, try to ramp up our production for Ukraine. And then the economic question is, how much of an economic hit is the president willing to absorb to stick it to the Russians in support of Ukraine? There's limits to what the Biden administration would do.  So I do have some doubts about how far we are willing to go. And I think Russia may just try to call our bluff here. And it'll be really interesting when the 50 or 60 days expire, whether that prompts sort of a strong US reaction.

We were running at about 25% of the proper level of munitions order. In other words,  When we needed four, we ordered one. When you do that over 20 years, you really create a deficit.

In other words, the majority of the artillery being used by Russia is North Korean. North Korea gave about 6 million rounds, which is 20 years of U.S. production to the Russians. Iran has built a Shaheed drone factory in  Russia, after giving them thousands of their own Shaheed drones or selling them, they now have a factory there producing it. That's what's hammering the Ukrainian cities every night. And the third thing is China has been backstopping the economy with increases in imports and exports, but equally importantly, providing the microelectronics that are used in Russian cruise and ballistic missiles.  So all three of these countries, this axis of authoritarians are supporting the fourth Russia in this fight. And that's who Ukraine's been going against.

It's essentially a threat to freeze Russia's lucrative oil exports, and it mirrors Senator Lindsey Graham's legislation that is gaining some momentum on Capitol Hill. Senator Graham touted his bill as another tool available to President Trump to pressure Putin to come to the negotiating table.  This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariff on any country that helps Russia and props up Putin's war machine. He can dial it up or down. He can go to zero to 500. He has maximum flexibility. But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.  All together, this is a significant turn in President Trump's posture toward Ukraine, as he deals with the practical reality that Putin remains a significant impediment to a long-sought peace deal to end the war. Joining me now is our team of superb reporters, NBC News Senior White House Correspondent Garrett Haake,  NBC News Senior National Security Correspondent Courtney Kube and our double chief, Chief Washington and Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell joins me on set. Great to have you here. Let me begin with you, Garrett, if I may. What more did we hear from the president about how he views this different kind of deal regarding weapons for Ukraine?  Well, I think the president here is trying to sort of split the middle here and provide weapons to Ukraine without providing weapons to Ukraine. He had a campaign promise to end this war on day one that obviously went out the window some time ago. But another one that said the U.S. would no longer be funding Ukraine's defense."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 241.133, "text": "Now he's able to allow for Ukraine's defense.  without funding it directly."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 244.979, "text": "And this includes those Patriot missile air defense systems that have been number one on President Zelensky's wish list, if you will, which will be coming from other countries. This is the other kind of benefit for President Trump, who has long talked about the idea that Europe needs to do more for its own defense. Here he gets to say that it's Europe providing these weapons, other NATO countries buying them from the US, and he can tout the superiority of American military hardware, another favorite talking point. From the White House's perspective, this is all a win-win.  And it was notable today, Garrett, that the president talked about the importance of a strong Europe, something we don't always hear from him. And part of that is some of Europe has had its own relationships with Russia over the years. What more do we know about how this could affect energy prices? Certainly, China is a big consumer of that.  Yeah, take a look at Mark Rutte's hand, the NATO Secretary General here, who's been kind of a guide for Donald Trump in dealing with Europe and dealing with NATO. I think you could probably argue pretty successfully to get to this point. The nature of these tariffs as secondary tariffs, not on Russia, a country with which we do little business of any kind right now, but on the other countries that buy their oil and gas, is significant. It's the kind of thing that could potentially raise prices in those countries on these  products and could raise global prices given the global nature of the energy economy here. So if you're China or Iran or another major importer of Russian oil, it might also increase your willingness to lean on Russia to end this war. This is just not the kind of thing that's good for the economies of any of the places in the graphics on your screen, potentially including the United States, which could see prices rise as well, again, given the global nature of the oil markets.  So it ratchets up the pressure, if you will, on Vladimir Putin in a variety of ways to make a deal of some kind and soon.  Thank you so much, Garrett. Let me turn now to our colleague Courtney, and obviously you can give us the picture of what does this announcement mean for the real fighting that's taking place on the ground. So it's symbolic in that the fact that President Trump is providing these weapons to Ukraine, but the reality is there are very few number of actual weapons or systems. They're going to be a game changer on the ground in Ukraine, and patriots are definitely not them.  But they will have the ability once, if in fact there are going to be multiple Patriot batteries brought into Ukraine that will defend against what we have seen are a barrage of Russian attacks in recent weeks. We're talking hundreds of missiles and drones being fired in just a day or just one night, Kelly. These Patriots will have the ability to defend against those, to save Ukrainian civilian lives. And that in and of itself should be enough to help bolster some of the Ukrainian momentum  hopefully, including on the battlefield, is the goal here by NATO to help bolster the fighting there. But the reality is, on a day-to-day basis, it continues to be a war of inches in Ukraine. And defensive systems like this are not likely to be able to push Russian military back in any real way.  and that cadence from Russia has been just alarmingly increased. When you consider the NATO piece of this, do you have any sense of how that will work? Is NATO ready to embrace this fully? NATO absolutely has been embracing this already. And one way that they may look at this weapons, this change, and how the U.S. is going to provide weapons and systems to Ukraine is a U.S. military component there called SAG-U.  It stands for Special, I forgot what the A stands for, Group Ukraine Assistance. That's the A, Special Assistance Group Ukraine. It's a military component that's based in Wiesbaden, Germany, and that's where the U.S. coordinates all of the assistance that they are providing to Ukraine.  NATO already works closely with SAG-U. Kelly, I could see a scenario where they only increase their coordination and cooperation, maybe even NATO taking a leadership role with SAG-U, and that they would be the ones to essentially distribute or coordinate systems moving into Ukraine going forward.  You are always fluent in acronyms, Courtney, I have no doubt. Thank you so much. Let me turn to Andrea. Andrea, so good to have you here with us. You know that President Trump had falsely accused Ukraine of starting this war at earlier times. Today, talking about their bravery, which he has acknowledged before, but there was a notable difference, it seemed."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 509.26, "text": "This was so different from that really operatic  experience that we all saw, the drama in the Oval Office with President Zelensky, where he was shown the door without even being given the lunch that was scheduled with the President, and certainly not getting the mineral deal that had been arranged by the Treasury Secretary, without any kind of signature, and basically told, you know, the blow-up really happened when the Vice President seized on the fact that Zelensky  appropriately by the rest of the world's view, said that Ukraine hadn't started the war and pushed back against that, and they seized on that in what looked like a setup, frankly, an ambush. Well, that has certainly changed. And to what caused this change, I think you saw the beginnings of it yourself.  When you were at NATO, and you were in that news conference, and a young woman stood up and talked about the Russian president. Oh, her husband. Yes. Her husband serving. And said, where are you from? And the president said, where are you from? Ukraine. And is your husband serving? And yes.

And coming up, rhetoric or reality? What to make of President Trump's latest tariff threats against Mexico and the European Union, and whether world leaders are actually taking him seriously? Plus, MAGA mutiny? The president tells his base to cool it amid a revolt against the Justice Department leadership for failing to deliver on conspiracy theories they once amplified, tied to Jeffrey Epstein. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  Welcome back. President Trump's threat of new tariffs on Russia's biggest trading partners comes as he announces new tariffs on the nations the U.S. relies on for major trading relations, including a 30 percent tariff on most imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1st, unless they make a deal. That weekend announcement coming just days after the president threatened 35 percent tariffs on certain Canadian goods, also effective August 1st.  In reaction, the EU is pausing its proposed retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. until August 1st as it looks to continue negotiations toward a trade deal. But at least some EU officials appear skeptical the president will actually make good on these latest threats."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "EU", "Unfair"], "line": 34, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1211.909, "text": " Could I just add that until now, our American friends have achieved one deal and 23 threats. So it makes a lot of sense that those of us who are threatened compare notes, as the commissioner said. And I think we shouldn't underestimate our power."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 35, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1229.611, "text": " They're keeping track. NBC News Senior Business Correspondent Christine Romans joins me now. Anne, help us to put this into everyday terms. When you hear 30 percent tariffs on EU and Mexican imports, what could that look like for American consumers?  I mean, it's a huge new cost in the supply chain for medicines, for pharmaceuticals, for important, you know, highly skilled manufacturing equipment that comes to the United States. You know, French wine and Spanish olive oil and Italian cheese. I mean, just think of all of the different things. This trading relationship is 30 percent of the entire globe's trade is those 27 nations in that block and the United States.  huge. So the worry is it could cause some companies, some industries to have, you know, huge new costs and company and factory closures. It could mean new costs for American consumers. And if there's that retaliation that you talked about that's now on the table, but that retaliation, if it happened, it would really hurt American farmers and brewers and Kentucky bourbon makers and a whole bunch of really important industries that export to the EU.  more of that uncertainty that you've been talking about and helping us understand for months. So when you look at the fact that the EU has, at least for now, delayed its retaliatory tariffs, what is more likely at this point, do you think? Is the EU willing to negotiate or are they expecting President Trump to simply back down?  I mean, they have to keep negotiating. And what we're hearing is that they are indeed still talking. But when you listen to the people close to the president, Kevin Hassett, who is one of his top advisers, saying that they've been working on these deals, but the president is the one in the end,  who can decide what he wants for the American people and who wants more from what some of these countries have been offering. In terms of the EU, it's an incredibly difficult, difficult negotiating bloc. You have the self-interest of 27 different countries, and then you have the trading interests of the bloc itself. So, I mean, it must be very, very interesting to try to be the person or the team negotiating with the U.S. on behalf of 27 different countries.  I suppose it's good they're still talking. One other way we look at this is how seriously are markets taking the latest iteration, the president's threats now? Anything you're seeing there? Taking it in stride, and this is something that we're told is actually bullying the president. The president can see that the markets have not reacted dramatically.  That said, it was the worst first six months for the dollar, I think, in 50 years. So in dollar markets and in bond markets, we have seen sort of the strain. You got Bitcoin at record highs. That's an alternate sort of store of value. So that could very well be all of this controversy and drama has pushed people into Bitcoin, although this administration and this president and his family have been very bullish about Bitcoin and actually in that business. So that could be part of it there. But the Nasdaq at a record high today. So you have  some people who are kind of cautiously looking at this snapback in markets from April, when the president made his first, you know, threats and then paused them, and who are saying maybe the market could be ahead of itself if the president really does come through with these very, very strong and steep tariffs.  Christine, thank you so much. Really appreciate that. I want to turn now to some news that has just been developing, and this comes out of the Supreme Court. We just learned that the high court is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its staffing cuts at the Department of Education. In May, a federal judge blocked the administration from making those drastic cuts to the workforce.  And now in a six to three, so that's the conservative to the liberal bloc ruling along those ideological lines, the court says they can go forward. The White House is looking to lay off more than 1,000 people as part of its effort to dismantle the Department of Education.  And up next, former President Biden speaks out, calling President Trump and other Republicans, quote, liars amid GOP investigations into his clemency decisions and his mental fitness while Mr. Biden was in office. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  Welcome back. President Trump is facing a brewing revolt from his MAGA base after his Justice Department shot down conspiracy theories tied to convicted sex offender, the late Jeffrey Epstein. Conspiracy theories, which the president and multiple top DOJ officials had previously amplified. In a recent memo, the Justice Department said it won't release any more evidence in the Epstein case and reaffirmed that Epstein was not murdered,  died by suicide, and that he did not maintain a client list. Now, that has prompted fury from Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, who has threatened to quit over Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of this matter, and that is according to a source who has spoken with Bongino. Bongino's anger at Bondi and skepticism of the DOJ's conclusions is being echoed by the president's loyal base.  And it was on full display by some of the MAGA's most influential media personalities at a gathering of young conservatives this weekend in Florida."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1552.336, "text": "How many of you are not satisfied with the results of the investigation?

The fact that the US government, the one that I voted for, refused to take my question seriously, and instead said, case closed, shut up conspiracy theorist,  was too much for me. And I don't think the rest of us should be satisfied with that.  President Trump is tamping down on any rift and standing by his attorney general, Pam Bondi, appearing with her this weekend and defending her as, quote, fantastic on social media. Joining me now is NBC News senior national politics reporter Matt Dixon, who's been covering this story for us. And, Matt, glad you are here to help us kind of put this all in perspective. When you look at this firestorm in MAGA World, is this really a creation of the president's own making?  But to some degree, I was at that conference in Tampa that you just played some clips from."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1640.099, "text": "And there really is sort of a Frankenstein's monster element to all of this sort of the scandal or the controversy that's been created really over a few years in the sense that the Trump campaign had promised its base transparency on the issue. They had talked about releasing the files, the Epstein files to the extent there are in client lists. And now they're in this moment where they're trying to walk that all back.  But they've created this sort of intensity with their base, and the MAGA movement that Trump created really wants answers on this. And the idea that the carpet has been pulled out from underneath them so abruptly really isn't sitting well with them. Trump has traditionally been very Teflon with his base, where he can have missteps, he can have things they might slightly disagree with, but they always come home. But I can tell you, in the convention center in Tampa this weekend,  It felt different. It felt like this is going to be a little more difficult. And to your point, part of that is, you know, because Trump himself promised so much on this issue and now appears to be walking it back."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 39, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1700.041, "text": "There was definitely a bubbling energy there where you were.

It feels like Bongino could be on the outs. And there was initial reporting that if he left, Patel would leave as well. And there was sort of a rift between those two and Attorney General Pam Bondi. Director Patel has since put out a tweet publicly saying that he is not leaving, he's going to stay with the administration. I think, again, that's sort of  the effort to try to move beyond this moment, even if that might be a little more difficult for the White House. So Bongino is a podcaster, had a large media following, and he is among the people who helped amplify the Epstein stuff. So I think there is some sense he wants to preserve here and wants to make sure that he still has credibility with Trump supporters in the MAGA base when and if he leaves the administration."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 41, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1765.038, "text": " So that credibility question leads me to my next thought. It's not the first time we've seen the president sort of annoy his base. That happened when he engaged in the bombings on Iran, those who didn't want him to be involved in foreign wars. Does this anger over the Epstein files feel different in some way? Does it have more staying power?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 42, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1783.465, "text": " It feels like it. It's always hard to tell because you don't want to sort of be captured by the moment necessarily where there's the most intense reaction and then it goes away. But being in that room in Tampa I've covered a lot of Trump events. I've covered a lot of conservative conventions. It certainly felt different. And again because Trump built  some credibility with his base on this issue is a main talking point for a very long time. So to the degree that you can put the toothpaste sort of back in the MAGA tube feels like it might be a little more difficult this time, because one, the allegations are terrible that the Epstein, and two, excuse me,  The idea that, you know, messing with children and doing things like this has become a main tenet of sort of Trump's messaging, of MAGA's messaging. So this hits home. This is sort of guttural for a lot of his supporters. So it does feel a little different than, say, a policy fight or an issue over foreign policy.

Option two is they're engaging in a cover-up. So is conspiracy something that Democrats really want to wade into? They often use that as a political weapon against Republicans and certainly MAGA conservatives. Is this a place where Democrats want to be?  You saw two things today. One thing you saw Mark Vesey, who has one of these districts in Texas that the Republicans are wanting to redistrict in a special session, who came to the floor and said, yes, let's make all of this public. Let's jump. And that's a Democrat running right into the middle of this saying, yes, let's just open this up so everybody can see everything, which is a good political move for him.

What are you hearing?  Well, it's more difficult news, Kelly. This is the last thing that Texas needed. This entire central Texas region battered by rain through yesterday and into today, which is stalling the search and rescue efforts here and causing the need for a lot more rescues in other parts. We just heard from Governor Abbott, who increased the total death count for the state. We now know statewide 131 people have died due to flooding, including  of course, most of the deaths here in Kerr County. In Travis County, where Austin is, nine people are dead and three are missing. So that speaks to the urgent need to try and find as many people as possible. We have seen the helicopters, the ground teams working again today after taking most of yesterday off. Kerr County gave the all clear to them to resume their efforts yesterday afternoon. But with more rain, it's been hard to get things in the air and people in the water  This is dangerous work as it is, and this weather is not making it any easier, Kelly. And exhausting and emotionally wrenching certainly work as well. Are you getting a sense that some of the additional changes in the forecast are having really practical impediments for what they're trying to accomplish?  Yeah, absolutely. I'll tell you, we were out with the dive teams a couple days ago watching how they do their work. And they said they're literally trying to look for bodies in muddy water that is far deeper than they are used to. And the problem is with the forecast, even if it's not raining on top of us right now, if it's raining upriver, that's going to come down in the hours ahead. So they are preemptively making sure that they're not in the water as it  rises. We were at the base camp for thousands of volunteers yesterday and it was empty. We saw it a couple days ago. There were people cooking food for first responders, donating trucks and equipment. It was buzzing. It was a little depressing to see it empty because as much as these people want to help, they just couldn't yesterday, Kelly.  You heard we played a clip of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem talking about the administration's response. Certainly the White House and she have been saying it has been an exemplary response. Are you hearing any questions on the ground? What is it that in the community where people are really personally affected by this, are they seeing the speed of the government response as she describes it? Or do they have a different perspective based on the conversations you've had?  I'll tell you, we have seen FEMA workers on the ground collaborating with local, state, and federal resources today. We've seen the FEMA office that has stood up to help anybody who needs to come to them for disaster assistance if maybe their home has been damaged.  To be honest, I've noticed a bit of a disconnect between the ground truth here and the narrative that FEMA has been ineffective. I've been talking to first responders, search and rescue teams, asking them if they are happy with FEMA's resources, and a lot of them tell me,  What are you talking about? We haven't noticed anything different. We have everything that we need, whether that is from FEMA or from neighbors coming out with a chainsaw offering to help. It has been an outpouring of support. I have not heard from anybody who says we don't have enough to do our jobs here.  That's very helpful to gather that kind of on-the-ground perspective. Ryan, thank you so much. Stay safe there. Stay cool if you can. And still to come, there are conflicting reports on the conditions of detainees at a controversial new immigration center that's been called Alligator Alcatraz. We will have reactions from the Democratic and Republican lawmakers who had a tour of that facility this weekend. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  We're glad you're back with us, and we are following a number of developments in connection with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, including a court ruling limiting who ICE agents can arrest in Los Angeles. A federal judge issued that temporary restraining order on Friday, ruling that federal agents have been arresting people based upon their race or their spoken language. The Justice Department says it is appealing the decision.  Also, we're watching that lawmakers are providing drastically different accounts of the conditions inside Florida's new immigration detention facility that's been called Alligator Alcatraz. After a tour of the facility this weekend, Democrats described it as dirty, crowded, and unsanitary, while Republicans describe it as well-run and no squalor.  It comes as NBC News has exclusive new reporting on the conditions inside other detention centers. Immigration advocates tell NBC News that immigrants being held in ICE detention centers in at least seven states are complaining of hunger, food shortages, and spoiled food. A DHS spokesperson said in a statement, quote, any claim that there is a lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.  NBC News Chief Capitol Hill Correspondent Ryan Nobles joins me now. And Ryan, when we talk about a tour of members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, how did that come about? Who are we talking about?  Well, this is a group of Florida, members of the Florida delegation, both Republicans and Democrats, but it was really Democrats that pushed to get access to what's being dubbed Alligator Alcatraz. This was after they were initially denied access to this facility. They ended up getting a tour. They said that it was a limited tour of the facility and what they described were inhumane conditions. They say that the people that are detained in this facility are  packed into cages, as they describe them, as many as 32 people per one of these cells that divide the detainees that are being brought in. They say that it is hot, it is uncomfortable, and it is not the way a federal immigration detention facility should be run.  Obviously, the administration feels very differently about this. They think that this is an appropriate use of taxpayer funds and an appropriate way to run this process as they carry out their mass deportation plans. But obviously, this is a controversy that is just beginning, and Democrats are going to try and highlight it as much as they possibly can going forward.  And their visit, Ryan, seems like it would be instructive because the Homeland Security Secretary said to Kristen Welker, our colleague over the weekend on Meet the Press, that the administration wants to build facilities similar to Alligator Alcatraz in other places. So might this be a fight that plays out from Capitol Hill this fall and in other states?  I mean  full of funding to help support the Trump mass deportation effort. So there's every reason to believe that if the administration wants to create more facilities like this, they're going to have the ability to do it. And there isn't much that Congress can do to stop it. And that there's even much of a will for members of Congress to stop it.  I think it really much more becomes a campaign issue, Kelly, as we head into the 2026 midterms. Democrats are going to point to this as being an example of how the Trump administration has run just roughshod over this immigration policy and that their mass deportation plan goes too far.  When you talk about campaigns, I want to bring up a new Gallup poll that shows that Americans' views on immigration are more favorable now than they were a year ago. A record 79% say immigration is a good thing for the country. That's up 15 points from a year ago. Just 30% say immigration should be decreased compared to 55% a year ago. So should this be a red flag for Republicans that views might be changing?  I mean, if it is, they're showing no signs in that direction, Kelly. Republicans have long believed that immigration is what they call an 80-20 issue for them. They believe that there's nuance in these numbers. And when presented with the way they're going about enforcing immigration, that that likely will be favorable to voters in the upcoming midterms. And we'll end it right there. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate it. We're back tomorrow with more Meet the Press Now. But the news continues with Hallie Jackson right now.  We thank you for watching, and remember, stay updated on breaking news and top stories on the NBC News app, or watch live on our YouTube channel."}], "keywords": ["Trade", "EU", "Trump", "Unfair", "Export", "Tariffs"], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Howard": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "President Trump expresses disappointment with Putin and announces secondary tariffs on countries doing business with Moscow if a peace deal with Ukraine isn't reached within 50 days.

Basically, we're sending the weapons and the Europeans are going to pay for them. Ukraine will be rearmed in a significant way, and perhaps that will finally bring Putin to the negotiating table. Putin made a big mistake trying to play Donald Trump. He can't do it.  After three or four ceasefire-related phone calls, or who knows how many, Putin then goes back and starts bombing Ukraine's civilians. That's an absolute no-go for Mr. Trump.

Anyway, Trump made it absolutely clear that he wants the war to stop and that he inherited Joe Biden's war. Trump believes, and I'm sure he's right, that Putin just waited for Biden to come into office and then he invaded Ukraine.  Certainly Biden's decision to flee from Afghanistan had a lot to do with Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. And we can all remember how pathetic Biden's response was as hundreds of thousands of Russian troops amassed on the eastern border of Ukraine when Biden then said, and I'm going to quote, don't end quote, don't.  which, as one wag put it, is what you say to your dog who's pulling a sock away. Don't didn't stop Putin, and nothing else Biden did stop Putin. And Biden's appeasement with Iran didn't stop Putin, nor his appeasement with China.  Trump is really the first president since Ronald Reagan with an effort to check Russia and its grandiose empire ambitions. Mr. Trump also announced a 100% secondary tariff on Russia, but not for 50 days. Personally, I think it should be a much shorter period.  Also impressive was NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, a former conservative prime minister of the Netherlands and a Trump friend and ally. But even more than that, the NATO countries agreed with President Trump to seek defense spending of 5% of GDP, which will send a strong, tough message to Vladimir Putin's phony ambitions. More than any time I can remember, the US is now working in tandem with Europe.  Now there will always be differences, of course. But interestingly, in response to a question on tariffs, Mr. Trump reiterated his 30% EU tariff proposal, but clearly suggested that it was a work in progress and trade negotiations are continuing. By the by, both the stock market and the dollar rallied over the course of the Trump-Ruta press conference.  More than anything, Mr. Trump wants peace, not war. He tried to negotiate with Putin, but it didn't work out. He has inherited a war that would never have happened if Joe Biden were any kind of a strong president. But Biden was a weakling, an appeaser. And Trump has to pick up the pieces and end this Russian problem.  If the United States and the NATO countries of Europe do act in concert, new weapons and all, it will mark the first major show of strength against the dictator Vladimir Putin.

And that was that no longer is the American taxpayer going to foot the bill for traditional security and defense of Europe.  You know, for 76 years, American presidents have been talking about that. Donald Trump delivered it last month. And now the next step is to make Europe pay for the defense and the support of Ukraine, which Joe Biden and, you know, some members of Congress decided that the U.S. taxpayer and the hardworking Americans should be paying for that.  Obviously, America makes the best weapons, and everyone wants them. And Ukraine, to defend themselves, President Trump's been clear, they should get access to U.S. weapons. And so Europe has come through the NATO structure and said, we'll put up the money, we'll buy these American weapons, and we'll send them to Ukraine to defend themselves.  Now, there is already a lot of support for Ukraine happening, and weapons are constantly moving, and that's anything from Patriot missiles, which you mentioned, to things like just ammunition and other types of armaments.

First, 100% tariffs on any country that trades with Russia unless a ceasefire is reached within 50 days. And second, a weapons deal with NATO members to send weapons to Ukraine. This comes as a bipartisan Senate bill that puts sanctions on Russia.  that its two lead sponsors say could be the sledgehammer. The president needs to end the conflict. It comes up in the Senate. We'll hear from the president, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, the two men behind the sanctions bill coming up. Also in the Senate, Republicans are focused on their bill to take back more than $9 billion in federal funds  including for public broadcasting and foreign aid. This is the same House Republican bill that passed last month in the House and the Senate has until Friday to approve it, but it's facing opposition from a handful of Republican holdouts over those foreign aid cuts and also from Democrats who say any rescissions would hurt future bipartisan government funding talks. We'll tell you all about it coming up.  The Associated Press reporting that it wasn't immediately clear what products could be targeted by the tariffs announced by the president today.

I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have the Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more. So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need.  so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hexhead at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you were planning to do in 50 days at this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them. So I really want to thank you for that. And it means the Europeans paying for it.

We can do secondary tariffs without the Senate, without the House. But what they're crafting also could be very good.  Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who's on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, posted on social media today, quote, I'm heartened that Trump is realizing that Putin is the only obstacle to peace in Ukraine. Today's announcement should help ensure that Ukrainians fighting for freedom have the weapons they need to defend themselves so they can be better positioned to secure a lasting peace.  And we heard that question about the Senate sanctions package. That bill would allow the president to levy a 500 percent tariff on imports from countries that purchase Russian uranium, gas and oil. Here are the bill's lead sponsors, Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal and South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, who talked about it yesterday on CBS News Face the Nation. Here's Senator Blumenthal.  This has to be a critical moment for these sanctions and bringing down this sledgehammer at this moment was emphasized by all of the European allies who were at the meeting that Senator Graham and I attended.  in Europe, they are absolutely in solidarity, one after another, in that closed-door setting, express the view that these sanctions have to be tough and rigorous to change behavior. And so the waiver language that we will have in this bill is very much alike the  provisions that have existed in past similar measures that give the president the ability to act in the national security but also provide congressional oversight and I think that kind of assurance to my democratic colleagues is very important but  What is most important, I think, at this moment is our unity. Senator Graham and I, Republican and Democrat coming together, the European leaders with diverse views, also in unity. And we want to make use of the seized assets, again, in a unified way. I think a multifaceted approach here is the only way to bring Putin to the table, because he's a thug. He understands only force.  And here's Senator Graham. Putin has calculated that we would get tired and Europe would get weary. He made a huge mistake.

South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal on CBS News faced the nation yesterday. And late this afternoon, Politico reporting that Senate Majority Leader John Thune said today he would hold off on advancing the sanctions package targeting Russia's trading partners after President Trump said he was prepared to act himself later this summer if Russia doesn't move toward a peace deal with Ukraine.  Politico quotes Senator Thune saying, If at some point the president concludes that it makes sense and adds value and leverage that he needs in those negotiations to move the bill, then we'll do it. We'll be ready to go. That from Senator Thune.  Now to the Republican funding cuts bill in the Senate this week. As we said, they have until Friday to pass this bill. It's the same bill that passed the House last month by two votes. In total, it cuts $9.4 billion in federal funding. And according to the AP, that includes $1.1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, two thirds of which that money helps fund local public radio and TV stations for their operations.  It also includes $8.3 billion in foreign aid programs. Among them, $900 million to combat HIV, AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water, and sanitation in war-ravaged countries.  $4.15 billion for two economic, civil, and institutional development programs in developing and strategically important countries, and $496 million for food, water, and health aid in countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts.  Other cuts are aimed at the global HIV AIDS program known as PEPFAR, which is credited with saving 26 million lives around the world and has broad bipartisan support in Congress. Republicans who have voiced concern about this bill include Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mike Rounds of South Dakota. In his Leader Time remarks this afternoon, Republican Leader John Thune talked about the 2026 agriculture bill.  Mr. President, the appropriations process is officially underway here in the Senate. Last week, the Appropriations Committee held its first mark of appropriations bills for fiscal year 2026. And I'm pleased to report that the committee referred two bills to the floor with bipartisan support.  And today I want to talk about one of the bills that came out of last week's markup, and that's the Agriculture Appropriations Bill. Mr. President, agriculture is the lifeblood of our country. And in places like my home state of South Dakota, farming and ranching are a big part of our way of life. I know how hard American farmers and ranchers work to deliver food, fuel, and fiber to America and to the world. And I know this work can be challenging, and at times, unforgiving.  In recent years, farmers and ranchers across the country have faced some pretty fierce headwinds. Higher input costs and depressed commodity prices strained their budgets, and higher interest rates made financing more difficult. Then there were the supply chain disruptions, natural disasters and drought, and things like bird flu, African swine fever, and the new world screw worm that threatened livestock.  Mr. President, just two weeks ago, Republicans passed a reconciliation bill that addresses many of the challenges head-on by bolstering programs that farmers and ranchers depend on.  But as I said then, farmers and ranchers' priorities are going to continue to be a priority here in the Senate. And the Agricultural Appropriations Bill is an example of that. Mr. President, our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee have reported a bill that provides robust funding to support America's farmers and ranchers. It provides important funding to the Farm Service Agency, including support for $10.5 billion in capital access for farmers and ranchers.  And it supports efforts to track foreign-owned land to prevent our adversaries, like China, from buying up America's farmland. It also makes investment in rural development programs at USDA. In South Dakota, that money goes far in supporting water programs, electricity, and broadband programs in rural areas.  This bill also invests in conservation programs, and it advances efforts to help farmers and ranchers get their products to the market. I'm glad to see support for processing capacity for meat, poultry, and egg products. And I'm pleased that this bill also promotes programs that help state-inspected plants operate across state lines, which provides producers with more options for their products and supports smaller processors.  The bill also includes funding for the Agriculture Marketing Service to help facilitate greater access to international markets for American agriculture products. And the updated market data that will result from investments in this bill will help farmers and ranchers make better decisions about their businesses. Part of Senate Republican Leader John Thune's Leader Time remarks. Now, the Republicans' rescissions package was on the mind of Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.  The so-called rescissions package continues the destructive Republican pattern. Cut now, ask questions later. The same thing that's happening with FEMA and the National Weather Service is happening right here. Again, use that chainsaw. Cut, cut, cut. Don't look at what you're cutting, what its effect will be, whether it's waste or whether it's sinew and bone. And then later say, oh, maybe we shouldn't have done that.  And you know what, Mr. President? Our Republican senators, most of them, know this is wrong, but they're so afraid of Donald Trump. Yesterday, he threatened any of them who voted against the full rescissions package that we have before us would face his wrath. What is going on here? Does anyone stand up to these horrible, horrible cuts that hurt the American people?  Republicans in real time are cutting health care. They're cutting education. They're cutting aid for our veterans. Veterans are not getting, they ask them. The veterans know they're not getting the health care they used to. And making things even worse, Donald Trump's tariffs are coming in at the worst possible time. And in a few short months, they're going to raise the cost of groceries. They're going to hurt small businesses and do untold damage to our economy.  And now this package suffocates public broadcast. Well, did they even know when they said they wanted to cut it? You know, Donald Trump doesn't seem to like it. How much it helps our rural communities? It's the only place they can rely on for local news, for weather reports? That farmers across rural America depend on public broadcast to get weather reports? Because there's no other way?  Did they know that it cuts international aid that ensures America's national security? Did they even think of the consequences? Just because Donald Trump says he wants it cut and everyone knows he doesn't know the details of any of this stuff.  The rescissions package is certainly troubling, but the pattern behind it is even worse. It sets the stage for even more party-line devastating cuts in the future, to health care, to education, anything Republicans decide they don't like. All on a party-line vote, all because of obeisance and fear of Donald Trump, not a conviction that he's doing the right thing. This is a dark omen moving forward.  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Politico Congress reporter Jordan Carney reporting Missouri Republican Senator Eric Schmidt, who is spearheading the rescissions package in the Senate, was at the White House this afternoon to meet with President Trump on the funding clawback per person familiar with per person familiar with what happened there.  White House Budget Director Russell Vought is also coming to the Hill tomorrow, according to Jordan Carney. And she's also reporting the Senate wants to take first votes on this bill on Tuesday. Now, you can see the Senate's consideration of this bill live all week on C-SPAN, too.  C-SPAN.org and the free C-SPAN Now mobile app. The House is also back to work this week on their agenda, several cybersecurity bills, including legislation requiring the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications Agency to examine the cybersecurity of wireless networks, and a bill directing the Consumer Product Safety Commission to create a pilot program to study the use of AI.  House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke to reporters today. One of the issues on his mind, today's White House Russia announcement. Vladimir Putin has spent the entire year punking Donald Trump and the Trump administration. Donald Trump promised many things to the American people and continues to betray the American people and break promise after promise after promise in a whole lot of areas.  including Donald Trump's promise that there would be peace in Ukraine on day one of his presidency. How is that working out? Donald Trump has spent the first six months of his presidency playing footsie with Vladimir Putin.  And the response from Vladimir Putin, a sworn enemy of the United States of America, has been to unleash terror on Ukrainian children, communities, and civilians. Donald Trump has zero credibility in this area. Is he just now figuring out that Ukraine is a friend to the United States of America and Russia is an enemy? Is he just now figuring out  that the United States should always stand on the side of democracy, freedom, and truth, which is standing with Ukraine, as opposed to standing on the side of authoritarianism, tyranny, and propaganda, which is what he's been doing by standing with Russia and Vladimir Putin? Is he just now figuring this out? Congress has to act independently in this area, and we should sanction Russia and continue to keep the pressure on.  Vladimir Putin, and Russia, a sworn enemy of this country, until the Ukrainian people are able to achieve victory for themselves, our NATO allies in Europe, and the free world.  And from USA Today, Texas Democratic Representative Mark Veazey has introduced a resolution calling for the release of all unclassified files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Representative Veazey posted on social media yesterday, quote, either Trump and his acolytes fueled the rumors of the significance of these Epstein files to help his campaign or something is there. Put up or shut up.  USA Today noting that candidate Donald Trump said last year that he would support releasing additional details about the Epstein case, but a memo by the Justice Department and FBI that came out July 7th reported no evidence of a client list or that Epstein had been murdered while in custody.  This comes after President Trump posted on social media over the weekend his support for Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel's handling of the case, writing, quote, Let's not waste time and energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about. But Leader Jeffrey's was asked about it this afternoon. The American people deserve to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as it relates to this whole sorted Jeffrey Epstein matter.  Democrats didn't put the Jeffrey Epstein thing into the public domain. This was a conspiracy that Donald Trump, Pam Bondi, and these MAGA extremists have been fanning the flames of for the last several years. And now the chickens are coming home to roost. The American people deserve to know the truth. What, if anything, is the Trump administration and the Department of Justice hiding?  What are you hiding? If you're not hiding anything, prove that to the American people. And if you are trying to hide something, as many of Donald Trump's MAGA supporters apparently believe, then the Congress should actually work hard to try to uncover the truth for the American people. There are only two things that are possible here. Option one,  Donald Trump, Pam Bondi, and the MAGA extremists intentionally lied to the American people for years about the Jeffrey Epstein situation. That's option one. Option two is that, in fact, there's reason for the American people to be concerned as it relates to what  information has not been released that could be damaging to the Trump administration and the friends and family of the Trump administration and their billionaire corrupt supporters. And so they're actively engaging in a cover-up. Option one, they lied for years. Option two, they're engaging in a cover-up. At this point, it seems reasonable that it can only be one of the two things.  And so it's Congress's responsibility in a bipartisan way to ask the questions and try to get answers on behalf of the American people."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1560.547, "text": " all the files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

So folks in that base are unmoved and they're going to continue asking questions.  I think that the onus is now on president Trump to see how he continues to respond. If he basically ignores his base, something that folks have been vocal about saying that for really the first time in this first six months, they view it as Trump misjudging the moment or misjudging where his base is at. We know that president Trump is somebody who likes to check in on his base and who likes to be up to date on how they're feeling and how they're reacting to the post. So there's going to be a question about how president Trump handles this.  but also a president, a question about how deputy FBI chief Dan, Dan Bergino handles this. Obviously we know that he did not show up for work on Friday. A notice was able to confirm because he was so upset at Pam Bondi over her handling of the Epstein case. So there's going to be a question of whether or not he shows up today. He shows up the rest of the week and how long he does stay with the administration. But obviously there are some major questions that they're going to have to decide on in that building behind me.  about how they go forward because we know that President Trump likes to be very loyal to his base because he feels as though they are very loyal to him.

You're listening to Washington Today.  In a nation divided, a rare moment of unity, this fall, C-SPAN presents C-SPIRE, where the shouting stops and the conversation begins in a town where partisan fighting prevails. One table, two leaders, one goal, to find common ground. This fall, C-SPIRE, on the network that doesn't take sides, only on C-SPAN.  Welcome back to Washington Today from Politico. Late this afternoon, a divided Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Education Department to fire almost 40 percent of its workforce, four months after President Trump ordered his administration to begin closing down the department. The justices, by an apparent 6-3 vote, lifted an injunction.  from a federal judge in Boston that was granted back in May against the firing. That judge found that the staff cuts were so drastic they would prevent the department from carrying out duties mandated by Congress. The judge also said the mass firings appear to be part of Trump's plan to eliminate the education department entirely despite a lack of congressional authorization to do so. That from Politico late this afternoon.  Yesterday was the one year anniversary of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. And today, a group of Republican study committee members introduced a resolution marking the anniversary. Here's Pennsylvania Republican Mike Kelly, whose hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania, was where the attack occurred. Yesterday, I returned to the Butler Farm Showgrounds, where I was with the president a year ago. I met with the Comptore family during a celebration of Corey's life.  They are incredibly strong, and I know all of us on stage continue to send our thoughts and prayers to them as we seek more answers about what actually happened that day. Now, we're here today to highlight new Resolution HR 571, which formally recognized the events of 2014 and July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. The resolution also condemns the rise in political violence we have seen across our nation over the last year.  from the assassination attempts against President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida, to the attacks against Governor Josh Shapiro in April, and to the deadly attacks on the Minnesota state lawmakers just last month. Let's be clear.  We must stand up together to oppose violence against our nation's leaders all across each party. And I want to thank my co-lead on the resolution, RSC Chairman August Fluger from Texas. When we talk about this, though, we can have as many resolutions as we want to bring it forward. And I've heard person after person, politician after politician, get up and say, I am absolutely appalled by the violence that's taking place in this country today.  And we've got to stop using that type of language. And with 24 hours, they're out talking again about who should not be sitting in certain offices. So it's one thing to have a resolution. It's one thing to be resolved the fact we're not going to keep talking like this. What I'm asking all our Congress, everybody that's in the Congress, everybody that's in elected office, please watch what you say. Don't start off saying we should never do this.  and then within 24 hours go out and make statements again that incite people? That's a false lead. It's a false premise. Our resolution is an attempt to get people to speak the way they should speak. In America, the way we settle things is by votes.  Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Mike Kelly, and in an article on city and state PA dot com, Representative Kelly said he still wonders why federal law enforcement agencies allowed Donald Trump to go on stage that day, saying, quote, they knew there was a suspicious person on the grounds for an hour and a half before the president came out on the stage. After everything was said and done, I still ask, why did they let President Trump come out on the stage when they knew the site was not secure? That will forever be my question.  Also from today, from CBS12.com in Palm Beach, Florida, what was meant to be a surprise inspection turned into a tightly managed tour. But what Florida lawmakers saw inside Alligator Alcatraz left them horrified. On Saturday afternoon, four Florida representatives, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Darren Soto, Maxwell Frost, and Jared Moskowitz were given what they call a sanitized tour of Alligator Alcatraz.  from officials at Florida's Division of Emergency Management and also federal officials. The members stated that despite the alleged limited access and sanitation of the tour, the conditions were, quote, horrific. They reported seeing people held in cages, unsanitary eating conditions, people begging for freedom, a man who said he had been hospitalized for days, among other concerning conditions. Representative Frost talked about what he saw in a town hall on Saturday."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 26, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2034.245, "text": " These are very nuts and bolts questions.

And we saw that those new cages that they were working on the demographic. This facility.  It is a mix of people. There are a lot of people there who just have a civil offense or just something very low that they were picked up for all the way up to people who have done violent crimes and all in between.  There is a wristband system when they arrive that they put on them to determine what kind of offense they had, most of them being civil offenses and small offenses, and they do not have them segregated. It's just a big hodgepodge of people all put together. And I asked a few questions.  on mental health issues and how people can seek mental health help. If I ask the company, there's a third-party company that's doing all the medical work. I'm looking through my notes to try to find a name for you guys. It's a third-party company that's doing all the medical work. I asked them, how often are you asked by the  People running the facility who might not be able to be put in the general population because of a health condition because of this and that they weren't able to answer the question. Then it looks like there's not a ton of communication on that front either. This leads me to another thing that I forgot to mention that I think is really important. This facility, when we 1st pulled up.  It was mainly third party security companies that were running the parking and the security and all of this. Then we get into the facility. And when we were at that, at the tent where all the cages are, the people holding us back and the people in there dealing with the detainees were from a third party security company. We barely saw any federal agents  A few people from the National Guard, a few people who are trained law enforcement officers, but it was mainly essentially cops for hire. Not any different than the people who want you, you know, if you were to go into a concert or go to a sports game. And these are a lot of the folks who are dealing with the detainees, transporting them around the facility and are essentially running the whole thing. So this is also a huge source of taxpayer money just going to corporations, but also  What worries me too is these people do not have the training you need to run a facility like this. Florida Democratic Representative Maxwell Frost on a town hall on Saturday talking about what he saw at the immigrant detention facility known as Alligator Alcatraz.  CBS12.com also reporting that Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis defended the management of that detention facility, saying, quote, it's not the Four Seasons. It's a professional processing center to effectuate the deportation of illegal aliens. That's what it's for. It's professionally run. It's going to be value added.  And from CNBC.com, dozens of U.S. ice cream producers say they are planning to remove artificial colors from their products by 2028. CNBC writes the producers, which represent more than 90 percent of ice cream sold in the U.S., are the latest food companies to take voluntary steps to remove dyes since Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said back in April that the U.S. aimed to phase out many synthetic dyes from the country's food supply.  Secretary Kennedy talked about it at an event today that included Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and officials from the International Dairy Foods Association. I'm particularly happy to be here today because this is relevant to my favorite food, which is ice cream.  Since we came in about five and a half months ago and started talking about eliminating dyes and other bad chemicals from our food, we've had this extraordinary response from the industry. And Brooke just rattled off this inventory, this extraordinary inventory of national corporate food producers have all made commitments  to remove food dyes from their food. And with this addition today of the dairymen and the dairy food producers, we now have about 35% of American food industry that has made commitments. And that's an addition between 35% and 40%.  And that is in addition to the 35% of the food industry that was already organic and healthy and chemical free.  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. CNBC notes several major food manufacturers, including General Mills, Kraft Heinz, James Smucker, Hershey and Nestle USA, have previously announced their plans to phase out synthetic food coloring. The IDFA said artificial dyes are safe, but that ice cream makers are taking this step in part to avoid disruption to sales from state efforts.  to phase out dyes from school foods and also West Virginia's recent food dye ban.
