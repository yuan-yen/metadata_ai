More details, listen."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 17.581, "text": " We've made a deal today where we're going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them.

President Trump has made a very smart decision and an agreement with NATO, which says Europe and Canada will pay for the weapons. The United States will manufacture them. Obviously, we make the best weapons systems.  in the world, and everyone wants them, and we're going to prioritize those going to Ukraine. And what this says also to Vladimir Putin, I think, is very loud and clear, which is, you know, we've given you a chance for peace. President Trump is a peacemaker. But if you want war, we will arm Ukraine, and Europe will pay for it. And it's actually, I think, a great step in ultimately bringing this war to a conclusion, to an end. You know, in the last 18 months,  Russia has gained about 1% of Ukrainian land. I mean, they're making no success. They're losing thousands of soldiers every single day. And way too many private citizens in Ukraine and the big cities are being injured. So I think this is a great next step in finally ending this war. But again, if Vladimir Putin wants to continue to fight on the battlefields of Ukraine, the United States of America will sell Europe armaments so that they can be used by Ukraine to defend themselves."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 117.7, "text": " Matt, like his predecessor Jens Stoltenberg, Mark Rutte appears to be a big fan of the president.

It used to be that the Europeans would like to have Ukraine have weapons, but they're very happy to have the United States pay for it. Now they're ponying up for it. So that's different.

But this is a natural progression of what we did in The Hague at the NATO summit, too.  We move the burden off the American taxpayer for European defense and on to European taxpayers, where it should be. And the traditional defense of Europe is now going to be borne by the European population. And at the same time, we're doing the same thing with the Ukrainian war. President Trump said today $350 billion of American taxpayer money has gone to support Ukraine. No longer. But at the same time, we're not cutting them off from weapons, and we're also  also not making the United States of America less secure. We're going to make sure that strategically we have enough that we need and then anything else that we can make, manufacture and sell to our European allies and give to Ukraine I think is a perfect and elegant solution for this."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 231.64, "text": " And now there's this idea of secondary tariffs, 50-day deadline.

Obviously, President Trump is the master dealmaker, and I think he saw an opportunity here to not only, you know, bring jobs to middle America through  making weapon systems. You know, I've seen some of those manufacturing things like in Lima, Ohio, where they build tanks, for example. And so I think there's a real opportunity here to help the U.S. economy, but at the same time help Ukraine and Europe's going to pay for it. And so, but obviously, Secretary Ruta is a very  important piece of this and I look you know every day that I work with him is enjoyable because he's such a professional and he is equally working hard to make NATO strong and make most importantly Europe strong because President Trump said it today when we were talking to him and that is is that a Europe a strong Europe as a Europe that can deter Russia frees up the United States to address all of our strategic concerns across the globe and that's a good thing for everyone."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 363.687, "text": " I mean, it is so interesting to see opponents of the president whining about him, insisting that NATO nations pony up and do their share.

So a lot of the story has to do with technical and macro catalysts, which are playing a major role in this recent breakout. So you have the expiration of options at the end of June, and that really helped to clear out lingering sell pressure, which unleashed volatility that had been pinned up by large open interest. So essentially what was happening was that short sellers were building up around that 110K to 120K level. And then they were forced to cover as Bitcoin broke to new highs,  And that's a move that really echoes what we saw in late 2024 when Bitcoin jumped from $70K to $90K in just a few weeks. And if you're looking at a similar 30% breakout from here, like if you're going from a base of $110K, that would suggest upside toward $140,000. And you guys hit this off the top of the show.

You've got everything from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds to corporate treasuries that are now allocating to Bitcoin, especially after the Department of Labor cleared the way for crypto exposure and 401k plans this May. On the Bitcoin treasury side, you've got companies like GameStop and even Trump Media that are following the Michael Saylor play  book, treating Bitcoin as a strategic asset on their balance sheet. Trump media plans to acquire $2.5 billion worth of BTC. And according to Bitwise, those corporate treasury holdings jumped 23% last quarter, topping $91 billion by the end of Q2. And at the same time, in terms of what we're seeing in the markets, you've got this wave of reverse mergers that are turning dormant public companies into public treasuries.

There's legislation to establish stable coin oversight, a market  infrastructure bill that would define jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC, among other things. And then a third piece of legislation designed to block the Federal Reserve from issuing its own digital currency, which has long been seen as a combatant to the crypto industry.

You've got, normally, you'd see a major upheaval in the bond market, because rates would just go through the roof with instability there. If you listen to Kevin Haslett today, and I think he's a smart guy, he's got zero credibility for what he says, that tariffs aren't going to impact the buyer, meaning the consumer, or companies. I can tell you, in the supply chain, as we look at it in some of our companies,  Aluminum's up 50 percent. So, source from the U.S. The U.S., the companies here are not fools. They now see a pricing umbrella 50 percent above where they were. So, where are they? They raised their prices 35 percent. So, even if you don't pay the tariffs, you're going to pay it here. And, look, companies that have EBITDA margins, like grocery stores, like many others, the auto companies,  They're mid-single digits at best. They can't absorb the tariffs to operate a law. So we'll come through. So the question is, back to Trump. He said there are deals. There are no deals. There are letters that he's saying, this will be our deal. The deal takes two parties. So he's going to have to renegotiate. The question that you bring up,  At some point, he's not going to tackle it. At some point, he's got to say, we're doing this, not just with steel and aluminum, but more broadly, so every other country feels it. The critical countries are, of course, India and the EU and Japan. Once you get through those, then the others really don't matter. So I think you've got to see some deals or some maybe fake deals, like we did with the UK, where it really doesn't matter. In terms of the overall risk in the market, it's definitely the Fed.  You can't put a complete dove in there. It's definitely tariffs. It's also inflation that could come from the spending bill that was just passed. And then it's more cuts they're talking about. So I think that the market's going to continue to ignore these risks, as they have for the last year. And the market accepts, OK, in just the final word, earnings.

I'm most likely to have another one tomorrow.  just raising a little bit of a war chest, because what I think will happen this earnings season, I do think overall we're likely to exceed a very lowered bar, but what I'm really looking for is what always happens in earnings season. One or two stocks actually have good reports, and the markets, for whatever capricious reason, just decide to sell the heck out of them.  And I want to have some dry powder available for when that happens. If it turns out that I'm wrong on that and the market keeps going higher, I'm not going to build so big of a war chest that it's going to hurt me as the market goes higher. But I do want to point out, seasonality usually does occur August, September. And it's frankly because of people doing exactly what I'm doing, saying, listen, we've come a long way in a short period of time. It's August.  I want to put my feet up. I'm actually going to take a little time off later this week. I want to put my feet up and not worry about things so much. I'm still going to be plenty invested, okay?

Scott Besson started speaking, was more prominent. And people like Peter Navarro, who the market was more skeptical of, took a step back. Now you're at the point where the president is talking again about higher tariff rates that's going to take the effect of the U.S. tariff rate up even higher than we currently anticipate it to be. So my argument would be, while we determine exactly what that level is going to be, after a truly historic rally off the lows,  Some breather is in order. And just to frame this for the viewers at home, top to bottom from the post-Liberation Day lows, the U.S. stock market was up 26% over whatever period of days that was. That's the type of rally that you see off the 2009 low, off the 1974 low, off long-term capital management low. 26% or so in that shorter duration of time is really, really rapid and really, really strong.

Right now, 4.98. If the yield goes out to 5.10, Hartnett sits up straight and watches. George Borre's out even farther than that. I don't know. Ken Rogoff, in my book of the summer, Our Dollar, Your Problem, really models out  Humility is in order here, as yields grind higher. So many people have been wrong. And when I brought up the 30-year French bond today, it's amazing how fast the yield space of France has changed. I don't think anybody understands, coming off of low rates, negative rates, how quickly they're out to, I believe it's a 4.25%, something like that.  We talked to Ben Laidler of Bardesco.

He did take pains to say on NX that he does not support a full-blown merger of Tesla and XAI, but he has signaled on there multiple times now that he would be in favor of Tesla putting money in.

You've got a good point, Paul. Private label has been consistently growing and got a huge bump since the pandemic. And part of that is that the retailers have really invested in the quality and the differentiation of those private label brands. So where consumers now really consider them not just a replacement for national brands, but in some instances, just regular brands of their own right.  And so, you know, Kraft Heinz actually had reduced some of its exposure to private label when they sold off the planters business, when they sold off the cheese, like the shredded cheese business with Kraft. But the core grocery business, they do still have a lot of exposure to private label. So is this a lot of competition from, let's say, startup food companies appealing to younger consumers? I mean, what kind of sparked this?  Well, there's really been a shift in the way consumers are looking at brands. And unless you own a long legacy brand that you can reinvent and really drive interest from younger generations, it's really hard to keep that going. And so what we've seen is that they've done a good job with revitalizing things like Philly cream cheese.  But despite a lot of investment, brands like Capri Sun, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House, these brands just aren't resonating with younger consumers. And that means that the growth prospects for those brands are a lot lower.

I mean, over time, Berkshire Hathaway has actually done quite well out of this deal, even though Kraft Heinz as an overall entity is probably disappointed in the overall analysis. But the merger was in 2015. It's been 10 years. The value of the deal at the time in 2015 was $45 billion. Today's market cap, it's $32 billion. And yes, they've sold off a couple of brands.  It just hasn't materialized to be the type of growth that I think Berkshire Hathaway initially envisioned it would happen. Jennifer, can you dig more into some of the advantages but also the risks associated with breaking up the company?  Obviously, some of the advantages, and this seems very similar to what Kellogg did when they spun Kellanova and WK Kellogg out into two separate companies. They separated the growth prospects and then those from the slow growth areas. That's very similar to what Kraft Heinz seems to be doing. Obviously, if you can focus on growth areas, that gives you undivided attention to really expand and grow.  That would be an advantage. I think one of the disadvantages, and this is something that's kind of a broader question to consider, is whether there's a cycle that's starting. Because we've seen companies like Kelinova split. We see Unilever spinning off their ice cream business. And those new entities are now being bought up by others. So you've got Mars acquiring Kelinova. You have Ferrero acquiring WK Kellogg.  But in order to get regulatory approval, you have to have categories that aren't overlapping. And so you're seeing a new birth of new kind of conglomerates of dissimilar portfolios. And so it makes me wonder if we're setting up another cycle where in another five years, 10 years, we're going to see these companies that have been buying up the underperforming brands going through a similar type of activity."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 731.292, "text": " What's driving all this?

And I think, importantly also, what that means is that Trump's threat to match any possible EU retaliation to those 30 percent probably is not very influential for the EU, because the initial hit  to trade has already been so large.

We're not feeling the slowdown yet, and we're very bullish on working with all those customers.  When you say you're not feeling the slowdown, that means that you're seeing consistent orders from those key customers or they're still committing to orders in advance. What do you mean by the definition of what you just said? So we have the operation in Reno and that's going very healthy and we're seeing the commitments coming in for this facility as well. So we're not feeling the  slow down yet. But yet again, I mean, you see this operation, this is a long-term commitment. So there may be some pushback or moving ahead, but we're committed for a long term and we're not shying away from those from time to time challenges.  Throughout the morning there was a lot of discussion about Tesla because Tesla makes the best-selling EV model in the world. This specific facility, does Tesla dominate the proportion of output or is it more evenly split across your different customers? So we're working with Tesla for sure and we're working with Lucid and Hexagon and other clients. So it is to diversify our EV manufacturing in the United States.  What do you mean by diversify, move away from one sort of core customer? No, not really. We're expanding, right? So we're definitely working with Tesla, but we want to work with other established OEMs as well as startups. So it's part of our efforts to expand our strategy and manufacturing output as well. What signals has Tesla given you about its future orders, about the health of its business?  Your guess is as good as mine. But we have a long-term relationship, longer than anyone else. And they're still a very important strategic partner for us. And I believe our partnership is very strong.  Throughout the morning, there was a lot of discussion of how Kansas was the absolute best candidate. What were the biggest factors in choosing this site? Were they financial? Were they simply the ability to get things done? Lack of red tape? Why were you able to move so quickly?  So we talked about the available workforce and the infrastructure. I mean, you saw the power lines built by the factory and as well as the energy procurement that we can do. But more than anything, there was something very special about Kansas.  All the officials were able to work with us, and you probably heard that Lieutenant Governor Toland making some of his speech in not only Japanese, but in Osaka dialect. And that level of insight and care and support really made a difference. And it doesn't matter what party they are, they're very committed to bring us here, but also make us feel home.  So that kind of partnership, not just numbers and infrastructure, but emotional partnership made the difference. And we're so happy to celebrate today. What I was going to say on the numbers is there is a job creation story. So 4,000 direct jobs. I think the number is 20,000 indirect jobs when you take into account supply chain, construction.  What have you had to do to kind of bring the other infrastructure you've needed to DeSoto, have everything you need around you? So what was great about planning it out, like I said, we started two and a half years ago, and at that time we worked with local schools and community colleges to create curriculums.  So when we start for manufacturing, they are there ready, already taking the courses and be available to take a job here. To guarantee you have the skill sets that you needed? Absolutely, absolutely. So we created curriculum together and it's been a really good partnership and it helps us and it helps the community and it's like wonderful win-win.  The headline figure was that Panasonic put $4 billion into this DeSoto facility, but you were also, the reported number is eligible for almost $7 billion from the inflation reduction act. How much of that materialized?  We haven't started the manufacturing here, so we have not seen the incentives yet. They're set against milestones. Yes, yes. So it comes with the production, so we're looking forward to it, and it's definitely a big part of our investment. Do you anticipate that you will get access to the full tranche of money?  We certainly hope so. Things have changed. I mean, things have changed even since you and I spoke in January. There is some effort underway to reshape or undo the Inflation Reduction Act. It seems like the $7,500 credit which goes to the consumer of the vehicle will go, but the 45x manufacturer credit seems intact. How have you navigated that? Is that your read on the scenario as well?  So we're still very hopeful that it should remain, and I think it should remain. It's not only for us, but it's for creating jobs and manufacturing and bringing technology to the U.S. So, so far it's very positive, and we're hopeful that it stays. It will be a big part of our long-term strategy.  What's the supply chain story right now for DeSoto, Kansas? When you think about your raw material needs and everything that goes into the sale process, are there things that are still difficult? What are they? Or has bringing this facility online been smoother because of policy?  We have been planning for the supply chain resilience not just for this and recent tariff situation but from COVID. During COVID we really suffered from weak supply chain. I mean I think all the industry did and so did we. So we've been planning for supply chain resilience.  And we are, I mean just for our benefit too, to make sure that those supply chains stay local and within the North America. And our goal is to complete 50% of our supply chain by 2030 to be completely local.  Are any of the conditions currently associated with that 45x manufacturer credit difficult when you think about foreign entity of concern or parts of the supply chain, which in the context of metals, China is still a factor here? Yes.  So, we started partnering with China for the supply chain resilience. We are trying to diversify and make sure the supply chain is more resilient to make sure that we can procure and process on site. So, it's not really a new change for us necessarily. We've been trying to do that for a few years. Where are the bottlenecks right now, if any?  I don't know. It's really the refining process to make sure that we can find a supplier who can make sure that the quality is there, right? The refinement, the quality matters for our quality production. So that's where we pay most attention to make sure that the raw material is ready for quality EV batteries, right? It's good for everyone. For consumers, we want to make sure those EV batteries are tested and safe.  I know this might seem far-fetched, we are just bringing this facility online, but one of the questions I got from you from the audience is what happens next? You have Nevada, you now have Kansas. Does Panasonic see further sites? For EV in the first instance, what is your next priority?  It's TBD. Today's the first day of this operation, and we're really excited to make sure that this goes smooth, producing quality EV batteries. We'll focus on that first, and if it goes well, who knows, right?  Demand is still a question. What I find interesting is a lot of the customer base is pure plate EV, but the lesson we've learned in the last 18 months or so is hybrid is still a big part of the market. Maybe in a way that surprised many. Do you have the ability to tap into demand for hybrid from this facility or others?  We don't know yet, but we're pleasantly surprised that EV sales still rose by like 11.4%. So that's a good sign. And like I said, this is a long-term play. So we're not going to be happy and sad with the small ups and downs. We're still bullish that EV markets should grow and hybrid transition should be part of it.  Have you done a sort of side-by-side analysis of the economics of a single cell? Bring mine back out. I have one single 2170 cell here. So this will be manufactured in Kansas, not subject to tariffs. You have the Nevada facility, but Panasonic Energy also has facilities all around the world. Is it just an instant fix that the cell on a unit basis  It's just a more attractive economic proposition if it's built here in Kansas for the American market versus shipping sales in from your overseas facilities. It makes a lot more economic sense to produce here, right? Bring raw materials here and produce here.  And we're cutting in for some breaking news here. We have President Trump in the White House with the NATO secretary-general. Take a listen. That was President Trump with the NATO secretary-general announcing that he was, quote, unhappy with Russia and is threatening secondary tariffs of 100 percent on Russia if a deal with Ukraine is not reached.  But first, let's get to some breaking news that crossed the wire. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, took to threads to say that the company will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in computing to build superintelligence. Shares rose off the news, and let's get right to that with our very own Kurt Wagner.

I will say that is a number that Mark Zuckerberg has thrown around before. Historically, he said that this is, you know, this drive for AI is going to be incredibly expensive. He's even admitted  Some companies, presumably his own, will overpay on AI in order not to fall behind. So hundreds of billions on infrastructure. But I think, Jackie, when you look at this, why it makes sense is you recall over these last couple of weeks, they've been spending very aggressively to hire AI talent for this superintelligence group. And I think this commitment to the infrastructure side is meant to sort of go hand in hand with that. OK, so we've hired the talent. We have the people in the building that we think can build this thing.  And now we're putting the money behind the infrastructure to help support them."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 859.4, "text": "Kurt, this announcement has fresh resonance, especially as some of Meta's competitors are making their own moves to really bolster their AI ambitions.

We've talked about this historically on this show before, this idea that all of Elon Musk's various businesses sort of work together and help one another. And I think that's just become more and more prevalent.  especially as XAI has grown. And so we learned that SpaceX, for example, is now investing $2 billion into XAI. We've seen that Elon Musk plans to put a shareholder vote to Tesla shareholders asking if Tesla should invest in XAI. We obviously know XAI and Twitter already merged or X already merged. So this notion that all of these different sort of  businesses of Elon's are now contributing to the AI business, I think is super notable. And you can see there are some, you know, to use the terrible cliche, synergies between these companies, right? The idea that Grok might be distributed through Teslas is one example of that. But it does feel like Elon is saying, okay, I have these other businesses that are doing well financially.

And so I think if you're Elon, you just say, look, you're putting in money now into a technology that's going to be worth 10, 100 times more down the line, but also you're going to get all of this data, this infrastructure that I'm building at XAI, and it could  could potentially benefit Tesla as well, again, as you improve self-driving, as you take Grok, for example, put it into the cars. So if I'm him, I paint this as very much like a rosy marriage between the future technology and putting all of that into an automobile, which I think they're already doing.

Thanks for joining us. Coming up, Lucid Interim CEO Mark Winterhoff joins us from the Panasonic EV battery plant in Kansas. More next. This is Bloomberg Tech.  Welcome back to Bloomberg Tech. We're live in DeSoto, Kansas, at Panasonic's brand new EV battery plant, 4.7 million square feet, at full capacity, which will happen later this year. Some news we broke with Panasonic's North America CEO, Megan Myung-Won Lee, 30 gigawatt hours of capacity. That's enough cells for 500,000 EVs per annum. One of the key customers, Lucid, and Lucid CEO Mark Winterhoff, interim CEO Mark Winterhoff, is with us now.  This is a significant moment for you as well, because it's your first domestic supply of cells. Reflect on that. That is true. Currently, we're getting our battery supplies either from Japan or from Korea, depending on the supplier. And Panasonic is a great partner for us. We decided two and a half years ago to make together this investment here and to localize the production, the cell production here to Canada.  It's not just volume supply. This is 2170, but my understanding is there was some co-engineering to make this as good as it can possibly be. Explain how that works. It's a great collaboration between our engineering departments and their engineering department. We bring in a lot of experience on what the cell is supposed to do in real life, and they make it happen with chemistry and with all of the parameters of the cell.  So it was really, really great collaboration. And that we also then are able now to produce this here locally, obviously in the current climate, helps us a lot.  How did the economics of the De Soto Candace May 2170 stack? I know that you love charts and spreadsheets as much as I do, but you must have done that analysis. Oh yeah, absolutely. What's it like? I would say we wouldn't have done it if it wouldn't be economically feasible or beneficial.  As I mentioned before, we made that decision not just recently. So tariffs were not on the radar screen at that time. We did that decision two and a half years ago. And at that time, together with the 45x incentive tax credit, the economics make sense. I still have to say, and I hope that Panasonic hears that, that there's some room of improvement. But also right now, obviously with the tariffs, this is a very good move for us.  because the same cell that would otherwise have come from Japan or Korea is subject to tariffs. It is. That's a part of the equation. That is correct. And the other thing that we are currently working on together with Panasonic is obviously further localizing the supply chain for the cell, because it doesn't do you a lot of good if you manufacture here, but you still import the raw material, which is then subject to tariffs.  So, we're already doing a lot of investments in that. You heard about our Graphite One investments on the graphite and other materials. So, we're working with them on making that happen as well. Mark, I've covered Lucid for a number of years. This is the first time you and I have spoken and I'm grateful for your time. Your predecessor, Peter Robinson, had a very simple argument. Lucid had the best technology on the hardware side and software battery management system.  And even though your journey started in the premium segments, that you would scale to volume because you would just say, this performance and range in this pack, we can just scale it down, make a more affordable version. Have we hit that inflection point yet?  Well, I mean, we're about to. You know, everybody knows by now that follows Lucid that, you know, we are very, very strongly working on our midsize platform. Right. Which is a, you know, smaller platform also from a price point perspective, more in the round in the $50,000 range and not where we are right now.  And that's when we really hit that inflection point. But with the gravity that we are ramping up right now, we are already expecting to have much higher numbers than we had in the past. Right. I think, you know, there's a lot of work to do in the second half of the year to reach 20,000.  What role does the DeSoto plant play? Will you be able to get hold of sales from here for vehicles sold or delivered in this calendar year? No, not yet. That is something for next year and again with our partners with Panasonic we are working on opportunities to further bring this in because obviously in the current climate that is very important for us to localize.  We've focused this morning a lot on policy. You brought up the 45x credit, but the consumer credit of $7,500, likely no more. What can you do in that environment with the vehicle? Are you able to pull forward lower price point variants? Are you looking to just appeal to the premium segment on an ongoing basis?  Well, first of all, when it comes to our current vehicles with the AIR, it might not be widely known, but we are the best-selling vehicle in our segment, the best-selling EV. And we also were in the second half of last year. Actually, no, in the beginning of this year, we were the best-selling vehicle in the whole segment, including ICE vehicles. So the AIR is actually doing well, although the numbers are obviously, when you look at the broader scheme of things, are not that high yet. But that's because of the size of the segment. Right.  With gravity, obviously we're now reaching a different scale, and we're still ramping up the production, and as you said, we have to do quite a lot in order to get to our target for this year, but it's going well. We're unclocking some of the blockages that we had in the supply chain, and our plant really got into the groove to create the vehicle.  So I would say the inflection point of having really economics of scale is still a little bit out. We're still more appealing to the higher price segment, that's what we have. And I mean, in automotive, you cannot just decide, oh, let's put out a new, cheaper variant next week. It takes years to implement, to plan, to engineer, to validate. So that's sometimes not well understood.  Manufacturing and building great cars is a long-term game. And you have to build also economics of scale over time. It's not something that happens from one day to the other. But I'll hold you to it. 20,000 is realistic this year with the time left to you. We're in a quiet period right now, so I cannot really talk about it. I suggest you tune in in our earnings call on August 5th. I will do. And you will definitely hear about it.  and the mid-sized platform is on track for next year. And the same applies to that as well. We're working very hard but on August 5th there will be news on that. The other part of Lucid's history was the idea of partnerships, manufacturing partnerships, licensing technology. Has that idea changed given the political environment?  No, actually, no, it hasn't. So as a matter of fact, and I said that in the last couple of months, and everybody honestly, understandably asked me, okay, where is it? Where is it? Again, those things take time. And particularly in the last couple of months with the uncertainty of the terrorists, I have to say,  Many of the people we had conversations with, they have other issues. They have pressing things to solve right now in the last quarter. We also on top of that had the magnet shortage, which actually halted production for several players. So those discussions still happen on our EV core technology. But also beyond that, stay tuned, there will be other news also coming.  Are those potential partners motivated by the environment, the effort to onshore industry in this country to work with American companies? There are different things. First of all, right now with the perceived slowdown of EV adoption,  especially companies that have both ICE vehicles and EVs, they can only invest the dollar once. So, right now we see, let's say, shift back to ICE vehicles, and therefore, but they still need to come out with new models, and therefore we have increased interest in, hey, can we do things together? And I expect this to continue, actually.  You talked a moment ago about being dominant in your segment, the lead seller in that segment. But everyone always asks me, if somebody is put off buying a Tesla vehicle, I drive a Tesla vehicle, a Model Y, but there are many out there that say, I don't want to buy a Tesla vehicle. Have you any data that says those buyers turn to Lucid in the pure play categories that you operate in?  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, as I just said, we're now the best selling vehicle in the United States in our segment. That includes the Model S, our segment. I mean, I don't compare right now the gravity because we're still ramping up. We're in the phase of ramping up. I guess let's talk again by the end of this year where we stand on the gravity. But the air, yes, we see a lot of incoming. We always actually, by the way, had a lot of interest from Tesla buyers. That's not really new.  But it has increased. Absolutely. This administration is fascinating in Lucid's context. Maybe the pro-EV policy is not there, but supporting U.S. manufacturers is. You also have the relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the administration in the context of GPUs, for example, has been supportive in those trade deals. What has the experience been like leading this company under the Trump administration? And net-net, how do you think you've come out so far?  Well, I mean, obviously things became more complicated. I mean, the tariff situation, I mean, there's no doubt it increases our cost. And it also creates a lot of additional headache, because you now have to completely rethink the supply chain. Are you continuing certain things, or are you localizing? Again, that's nothing that happens from one day to the other. We are doing okay.  when you compare to other players in the industry, also from the cost increases, particularly because we build everything right now in the United States. We build all of the vehicles, our key components, they're all built here in the United States. Having said that,  We are hit by obviously raw materials or let's say tier two suppliers that we have to import and we have to pay tariffs on that. So it's not that we are not impacted but we are less so than others. So yeah I mean it's something we have to work with.  And for us, it's also because we are a pure EV manufacturer. We believe in the future of electrical propulsion. We're not wavering. We're not saying, oh, let's do, I don't know, a range extender or something. That's not going to happen with Lucid. This is part of our vision, you know, that this is the future and actually important to save our planet. So we will find a way through this, but also I have to say,  For the American consumers, vehicles are going to be more expensive under the tariff regime. There's no other way around it. Yes, you can say, oh, you just need to localize. Well, yes, but that still increases the costs, because there's a reason why the supply chain is so global, because certain things are either not available here in the US or are just very expensive, so you import them. And if you change that, you still have higher costs here in the United States, which means  Manufacturers like us, or actually any manufacturer, has to increase prices. There's no other way, unless you want everybody to be non-profit organizations, which then would lead to no innovation, no technology leadership, and I think that's, in the current climate globally, it's the last thing we want.  The cost of doing business in America. Mark Winterhoff, Lucid's interim CEO, one of the core customers at this Panasonic DeSoto Kansas plant that is due to hit full capacity this year.

The Trump administration has already dropped a lot of lawsuits that the Biden administration had brought against crypto companies, sort of letting it be trading free for all.

And so that's kind of the Fed's rationale for these renovations. They were approved by the Fed's board several years ago. So this project is not a new project.

And so what we're seeing here is President Trump and those in his administration now taking issue with the overall price tag of the project, which has increased in recent years.

Stocks are at an all time high.  He's pressing his bet to be able to get a better deal ahead of those August 1st deadlines. I mean, the EU, US, they're not very far off in terms of what they need to agree to get some sort of deal done.

And if it did, you get a pretty big, significant tariff increase. But I would remind you, the E.U. is going to China at the end of this month. I'm sure the U.S. would like to have a deal in hand before then. So, there are reasons to do these deals. We're going to watch it play out over the next two weeks. And Trump just has to be careful. He burned his hand on the stove in April by trying to do $700 billion of tariffs.  We're starting to get closer to that range again. He does have some cushion and the market's giving him a leash because Treasury Secretary Besent's done well. But if they go too far, you'll start to see backlash in that.

And so Treasury has to figure out how it's going to finance the deficit overall.  And they're making a series of moves. So, number one, they've delayed how long it will take to refill the Treasury general account. Number two, they're going to change the supplemental leverage ratio rules. Number three is that they are going to do more buybacks and increase the amount of T-bill issuance and how crypto falls into that or how stablecoin falls into that.  Once you pass the stablecoin legislation, it creates this extra T-bill demand, and it could be as much as $800 billion. So Congress is passing a stablecoin bill this week. That should set the stage to kind of fill that liquidity. And if you're in a country and you're trying to get money out, then the Bitcoin is a way to get around it.

He gets off the phone and he says Russia starts bombing Ukraine again. He says Russian President Vladimir Putin has fooled many people. It's unclear if he's including himself  in that, but certainly you can see some frustration creeping in there. So two things that stand out from what he was saying. The first one is that he's talking about penalizing Russia economically. It's unclear what he means by secondary tariffs. Does he mean direct tariffs on Russia?  The US and Russia don't do a lot of direct trade, so tariffs may not have a massive impact. Does he mean secondary sanctions on countries that are taking Russian products, particularly again, China and India, who import a lot of Russian energy? So is he threatening to put penalties on countries that are doing business with Russia, particularly around the energy space? He says he'll give Russia 50 days for a deal. It's unclear exactly what he means by a deal.  or he may impose some penalties. So there's a lot that's unclear from that, but certainly a sense that he's now dangling the idea of economic penalties on the government, the regime in Russia. And secondly, he's confirming that he will indeed provide Ukraine with what seems to be defensive weapons, primarily Patriot battery systems to allow Kiev to better defend  itself and those would be paid for though, they're not going to be given to Ukraine. Europe will be paying the US to provide those weapons and it will send them on into Ukraine.

But as you say, the key thing was he didn't really clarify if this would be just defensive weapons, again, that allow Ukraine to withstand Russian missiles and drone attacks, or whether it would be offensive weapons which would allow Ukraine to keep taking some of the fight into Russian territory directly. We know Ukraine's been firing drones at Russia and looking to attack Russia on its own territory, and it's running out of those kinds of weapons, long-range missiles and so on.

But equally, for now, he's been able to keep going. The question is for how long, given those cracks that we're starting to see in his economy. So further sanctions or tariffs, or whatever you want to call it, on Russian exports to the US, that's unlikely to have a major impact because there's not much that Russia is sending directly to the US.  The real impact would be to come at countries, again, China and India primarily, who are buying a lot of energy from Russia, and that's giving Russia access to hard currency to fund their war in Ukraine. And if you penalize China,  and India for buying oil, for example, from Russia, that could have an impact.

And I think Mark will tell you that it was really perhaps more important the date of November 5th. That was the election day. Maybe that was the most important because we've made tremendous progress together. And one of the reasons that you're here today is to hear that we are very unhappy, I am, with Russia.  But we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with them, and we're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. Tariffs at about 100 percent. They call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And, as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine.  And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it. And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there. So, based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. It's very simple. And they'll be at 100 percent. And that's the way it is. It can be more simple. It's just the way it is. I hope we don't have to do it.  But regardless, we are going to be \u2014 we make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's missiles \u2014 you saw that recently in Iran, the way those planes flew in. They had every single \u2014 14 bombs hit every target. Then you had the helicopters shoot a total of 30 bombs, 30 missiles. And they hit every single \u2014 Marco, is that right? \u2014 every single piece, every single target. And it was \u2014  I guess on a scale of zero to 10, they say it was about a 15. That's how successful it was. That's how lethal it was, a word they like to use nowadays. But it was an amazing, well-organized attack that people in this country wanted to do for 24 years. You know, when we had the pilots in last week, they were saying, sir, we've been practicing this for 24 years, meaning people, not them, but other people that are a little older now.  But they do. And you were the one that let us do it. But we've been practicing it three to four times a year for 22, 24 years, because they always knew they had to stop Iran from doing what they were doing, which is trying to come up with a nuclear weapon, a nuclear bomb. And we did it very successfully. And we make the best equipment, the best missiles, the best of everything.  The European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And they have \u2014 these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too. But we're in for a lot of money, and we just \u2014 we don't want to do anymore. And we can't.  But we make the best, and we're going to be sending the best to NATO, and in some cases to maybe, at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany, where they're going to send early-on missiles. And they'll be replaced, and NATO is going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here, who's a great ambassador. And Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So, in a nutshell, we're going to make top-of-the-line weapons, and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something, and it'll be mostly in the form of a replacement. And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy, for having had the career that he's had, because he had an amazing career  before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months.

This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want to bring what it needs to have to maintain  to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent, but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production.  So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have the Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more. So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need.  So if you can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hexhead at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days at this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them. So I really want to thank you for that. And it means the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries. We will deal with that. And exactly as you said, it might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here.

India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled. And they did. And they were both great. Great leaders. And they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years. And at least 7 million people killed and killed with  A lot of pretty rough weapons, like machetes. Heads chopped off. Going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near. It's so frightening. And we got that one solved. Serbia, Kosovo. Got that solved. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I used. I used strafe for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars.  And that was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here on the Strip, the Gaza Strip. I call it the Gaza Strip. One of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace. It brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Witkoff is here, and I think we could have something fairly soon to talk about.  And we solved another one, one that we just seem to have, Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with an extra neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which  closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we're working on that one problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that. You've been hearing about that one. And that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam.  But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income in life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia. I'm not happy. And I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started.  If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye. But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they didn't have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. And I was outside looking in. And I said, you know, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started.  It's a real mess. We're losing \u2014 I guess they're losing 5,000 or 6,000 people a day. It's actually now more. I used to \u2014 I was saying 5,000 a day. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up, too. It's a horrible war. And it should be stopped. And so, if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing \u2014 secondary tariffs. And they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do, but I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk, and then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people. It's got to stop. It's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars' worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States, going to NATO, et cetera.  And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance. And they still would have had no chance if the equipment \u2014 they had the best equipment. Because we do make the best planes and missiles, and we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. And we have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about \u2014  the Golden Dome, it's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage, because somebody has to use that equipment. And they fought with tremendous courage, and they continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they don't have \u2014 they're losing on equipment.

I mean, they are missiles, but they are intended to intercept incoming missiles. They're most effective against incoming missiles than any other kind of projectiles, but the reality is they can take out other projectiles as well. One thing that really stood out to me in the president's announcement right there was when he suggested  that one country alone may send as many as 17 batteries. That's not 17 individual interceptor missiles. That's batteries. A battery is made up of a radar, a control station, multiple launching stations. Each one of those can fire off multiple interceptors. So a battery in and of itself  A new one right now is upwards of about a billion dollars, Hallie. The interceptors themselves, they range in price depending, but they can be well over a million dollars as well. I mean, frankly, even as much as six million, depending on the variant. But no matter what, this is an expensive system.  Only a handful of countries in the entire world operate a battery. And I think there's only two or three. I was trying to do the research as the president was talking there, that have as many as 17. The United States is one. Japan has only a few more than that. So one country sending 17 batteries is an enormous  investment by that country. Now, one thing that the president suggested there also is that the United States would work with NATO to distribute these. Remember, the United States several years ago set up a military command. It's known as SAGU. That's Security Assistance Group Ukraine.  It's a command based in Wiesbaden, Germany that is the whole purpose of the command is to distribute security assistance to Ukraine. Hallie, I could see that NATO in some way will be more even closely coordinated with SAGU as a way to effectively and efficiently distribute things like these Patriots and any other potential  defensive weapons that the United States decides to sell to these NATO countries, or what also sounds less about, it also sounds more like this is a swapping. The United States would sell newer systems to the countries and they would provide their older systems to Ukraine.

Now, with this legislation finally signed into law by President Trump, Main Street businesses will be able to expand, and working-class Americans will take more money home in each paycheck.  The golden age of America has arrived. Thank you. Madam Speaker, this past weekend marked one year since the attempt on President Trump's life in Butler County, Pennsylvania. While we thank God that President Trump's life was not taken, we mourn the loss of an innocent father, a firefighter, and a proud Pennsylvanian  Cory Comparator, political violence of any kind has absolutely no place in our society. Yet the violent rhetoric coming from my colleagues across the aisle has not stopped. Now, a year after the assassination attempt on President Trump's life, they have turned their violent action toward our colleagues, ICE agents, who work every day to protect our communities.  The political violence that we are seeing in our society today will not stop unless the violent rhetoric stops. One life lost to political violence is one too many. And I ask my colleagues to remember that regardless of our political beliefs, violence is never the answer to our nation's problems.

The European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too.  We're in for a lot of money and we just, we don't want to do anymore. And we can't, but we make the best and we're going to be sending the best to NATO and in some cases to maybe at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany where they're going to send early on missiles.  And they'll be replaced, and NATO's going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here. He's a great ambassador, and Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So in a nutshell, we're going to make top of the line weapons and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something and be mostly in the form of a replacement.  And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy for having had the career that he's had. He had an amazing career before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months. And if you could say a few words. Absolutely. No, no, Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you don't want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent.  but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defence industrial production. So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have the Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more.  So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hexhead at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for that. So I really want to thank you for that. That means the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here. So really, thank you. This is important."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 243.734, "text": "Thank you."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 243.954, "text": "You did a great job.

India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled. And they did. And they were both great. Great leaders. And they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years.  And at least 7 million people killed and killed with.  A lot of pretty rough weapons, like machetes, heads chopped off, going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near, so frightening. And we got that one solved. Serbia, Kosovo, got that solved. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I used. I used strafe for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars.  And that was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here on the strip, the Gaza Strip. I call it the Gaza Strip, one of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace. It brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Witkoff is here. And I think we could have something fairly soon to  talk about. And we solved another one, one that we just seem to have Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with an extra neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which  Closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we're working on that one problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that. You've been hearing about that one.  And that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam. But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income and life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia.  I'm not happy, and I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started. If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye.  But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they're going to they're going to have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. And I was outside looking in. And I said, yeah, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started.  It's a real mess. We're losing, I guess they're losing 5 or 6,000 people. There's actually now more. I used to, I was saying 5,000 a day. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up too. It's a horrible war and it should be stopped. And so if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing. Secondary tariffs and they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do. But I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk. And then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people.  It's got to stop. It's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars' worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States, going to NATO, et cetera. And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance.  They still would have had no chance if the equipment, they had the best equipment, because we do make the best planes and missiles. And we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. We have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about the Golden Dome. It's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage because somebody has to use that equipment.  And they fought with tremendous courage and they continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they don't have, they're losing on equipment. And Russia has really taken a very positive, very, very  strong, I mean, what they've done in the last couple of weeks. Without military reasons, that's what they are doing. 700 drones a day, missiles, bombing cities. This is not because of military goals. It is just creating panic, keeping people out of their sleeps, hitting towns. It's really terrible. And it is meaning a lot of people lose their lives, but also the infrastructure, whole cities being  They're wiping out the electric. It's going to take years to rebuild it. That's going to be the next problem. But that's going to take a long time. Many of the cities are knocked down to the ground. Many of the people have left. But many have stayed. I don't know. They actually stay. Most have stayed, actually. It's incredible that they stay, knowing that a missile could be hitting your apartment house.  And your apartment house that you're sitting in could collapse on top of you. And they do very heavy construction. They don't use rebar. They do very thick concrete construction. Those are heavy buildings, big buildings and heavy buildings. And they collapse like  like they're made out of paper. It's unbelievable to see this happening with people, so many people being killed. So we think we're going to make progress and we hope we're going to make progress. In the meantime, we're going to get you good service on what you need. And we really became friendly with NATO this last meeting. You know, we went from 2% to 5%, which everyone said  was not even a possibility. They weren't paying 2%. Many of them were paying much less than 2%. But even those, since you became president, all committed to the 2% before the summit. And now, collectively, we committed to the 5%. That's right. They did. They've been very good. And I think I made a lot of friends over there. We had a couple of days of very intensive talks.  And they're great people. They're leaders of countries, leaders of countries. Many of them great countries, some of them smaller countries. But for the most part, that's a very solid, strong countries and very successful. Some of them are among the most successful countries in the world.  So that's the story. We hope that's going to have an impact on Vladimir Putin. And we hope it's going to have an impact on Ukraine also. We want to make sure that Ukraine does what they have to do. All of a sudden they have, they may feel emboldened or maybe they don't want, you know, this is a very  difficult situation. Ukraine wants a peace deal. I think so. And they will stay committed to that. There's no doubt they want it. But the Russians have to be. They have to continue to want it, though.

You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes, then it's easier to stop them. And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language. I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. I know Putin very well from the days when I was prime minister. And then once you have to test him, and you did this, and you really gave him a chance to be serious, to get to the table.  Well, as we told you at the top of the program, President Trump is sending additional weapons to NATO countries for distribution to Ukraine. It's part of his effort to try to end the war with Russia. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was on hand for that announcement, as you saw in the Oval Office. He joins us on set tonight. Mr. Secretary General, thanks for being here. Good to be on the program. What's your takeaway from your meeting today and that announcement and how significant it is?  This is really significant. So last Thursday, I got a call from President Trump. He said, hey, Mark, we really want to ramp up the support for Ukraine when it comes to weapons. And then this morning, I was in the White House preparing for the meeting with him. And he said, when it comes to the sanctions, clearly, we have to take the next step now. And he can only dialogue once. So he has to take this step by step. I totally understand that.  But he was really, I think, irritated with his last phone call with Putin, who is not serious, it seems, about getting into peace negotiations. So now there's a 50-day deadline. Essentially, the president put that on the table today. And you think that the sanctions on other countries doing deals with Russia will create additional pressure, exponential?  Absolutely. This is significant. So today if you are in Beijing or in Delhi or you're in Brazil and you know that this is coming to you, you might want to call Vladimir or Vladimir Putin and say, hey friend, we are still buying stuff from you, but you have got to get serious when it comes to these negotiations on a ceasefire or a peace deal, or otherwise we get hit by these secondary sanctions. There will be also an effect directly on Russia, of course.  But this is really significant. And it is smartly designed by the president. What about the weapons themselves? Why not the U.S. directly to Kiev? Why through European countries? Well, there are two sides to this. One is the logistics. And NATO is good at logistics. So get the weapons into Ukraine in a way that they can make maximum use of them. So packaged in packages which are really useful. And for them to be maximum effective. And then, of course, is the issue of who is paying for it. And the president  And I totally understand this. He said, hey, listen, Mark, we want to deliver these weapons into Ukraine, making sure that they can sustain in the fight, that they somehow are able to defend themselves against the Russians. But you guys in Europe have to pay for it. And I think that's fair. We had the NATO summit, which was a huge foreign policy success for President Trump. Europeans stepping up. And here again, the Europeans are stepping up, taking responsibility to pay for these weapons.  You know, Vladimir Putin has shown no indication he's going to stop this. And obviously, you've talked to the president about how much these phone calls have irritated him. We have this chart that shows the number of attacks, drone and missile strikes on Ukraine, sometimes right after these phone calls going up. So what is it going to take? How much more support for Ukraine to get to the table?  negotiating table to push Russia to that point.  Putin now hears from the American President and from the Europeans is that we will do whatever it takes for Ukraine to be as strong as possible when peace deal is taking place or peace negotiations will start to be in the best possible place at that moment. And then on top of that,  the threat of sanctions in 50 days on those who are still buying, like Brazil, India and China, from Russia. So if I was in the Kremlin today, I would not be too happy. Because this is a clear signal that President Trump is serious. He wants peace. He hates the fact that so many people lose their lives in Ukraine.  You mentioned the NATO political success for President Trump. The New York Times writes it this way. Since his first term, Mr. Trump has been pressing for the Allies to spend more on their own defense. After one day meeting in the Netherlands, they agreed to raise their spending on the military to 5% of their national income by 2035. The amount consists of 3.5% on traditional military needs, like troops, weapons, shells, and missiles, up sharply from the current target  of 2%. I mean, describe that for the layperson in America, how big a deal that is, that shift. It really started in the first term with President Trump, but now in this moment. The direct impact, if I was living in America, is more jobs for the middle class. Because this will mean more production lines, more shifts in the great defense industrial base here in the US. Of course, the same in Europe, because we need the defense industrial base across the alliance, from Turkey up to and including California. Well, it will mean more jobs for the middle class in the US.  President Trump was pushing Europeans to get to this famous 2% which was the old target at the beginning of this year. Seven, eight countries were still not on that 2% and they all came in before the summit in The Hague. Spain was not there. Also Spain committed to the 2%.  But now 5% is a little too much for them. They are saying we can get there on a lower percentage. Absolutely not true. They will not be able to do that. They will need to spend the 5%. But OK, we said you show us you can do it for a smaller amount of money, but you will never be able to do that. That's clear. But all 32% have committed to this 5% and to their target.  I think one of the biggest foreign policy successes of President Trump. And it also means that NATO is reinvigorated because it is fairer, we spend the same as the Americans are spending on the European side, and we need it to keep ourselves safe from Russia, which is investing in its defence at a staggering rate.  You said that the US is not secure if the Atlantic, Europe, and the Arctic are not secured. There's an increasing realization, and let's not be naive about it, if Xi Jinping would attack Taiwan, he would first make sure that he makes a call to his very junior partner in all of this, Vladimir Putin, residing in Moscow, and telling him, hey, I'm going to do this, and I need you to keep them busy in Europe by attacking NATO territory. So you see this all linked.  together. And most policy experts see this all linked. Because there was always the thinking the Chinese might attack Taiwan as a sort of isolated incident, which is, by the way, of course, big enough by itself. But it is clear that China is supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine together with North Korea and Iran. So this is North Korea, China, Iran working together with the Russians.  And China is doing that for a reason. It gives them leverage over, indeed, their very junior partner, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. And clearly, if they would move on Taiwan, they will force Putin to move on Europe. And for the U.S., NATO is there because, of course, you want Europe to be safe, but in the first place, also, because the U.S. has to stay safe. And therefore, you need a safe and secure Atlantic, Arctic, and Europe. How is President Trump seen around the world by world leaders you deal with?  I think he is very well respected. And I saw in The Hague, at the summit, 31 leaders. So the 32nd, of course, is the US. In itself, by the way, bigger than all the other 31 combined. That is how powerful this country is and this nation is in your military. But the other 31 leaders really recognizing, hey, this is somebody who is absolutely clear what he wants to achieve, is committed to NATO, but he is extremely frustrated about the fact that we are not paying up. And now we are paying up. And therefore, this commitment to NATO is ironclad.

Thank you so much. Good to be in the show.  We just watched major, major policy shift from President Trump, who spoke live from the Oval Office, joined by NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The president announced he will be allowing Ukraine to purchase more American weapons, including Patriot defense missiles.  And the president tore into Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said, quote, he's very unhappy with Putin and threatened 100% tariffs on Russia if the peace deal is not agreed upon within 50 days. When asked 50 days, why that long? He said, it's really not a long time. I mean, think about it. 100% tariffs could be coming.  They could not sustain that with that economy. This is Outnumbered. I'm Harris Faulkner, here with my co-host, Emily Campagno. Also joining us today, Lisa Booth, Fox News political analyst, Alicia Acuna from the West Coast, Fox News senior correspondent, and Paul Morrow, Fox News contributor, attorney, and retired NYPD inspector and attorney. All right, so Alicia, we look at the situation. We've been covering this for 1,220 days.  So the idea of Ukraine getting crushed and needing more is not specifically new, but President Trump ran in part on saying he would end this. It's 157 days. It's not that long into his presidency, and he's given an ultimatum to a man he once described as having a good relationship with.  Yes, absolutely.

He's got his own deal going on as well, with 100% tariffs on the table in 50 days. He made it very clear, we're going to hit them and we're going to hit them hard. Some of it's going to come from me, some of it could come from the Senate. But either way, you are dealing with me now.  And he also made it incredibly clear that you are no longer dealing with President Biden. Right. I think it's also important, Paul, that we not pay for this. And that seems to be critical because the president hit that point hard. Let's watch. I am with Russia, but we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with him and we're going to be  doing very severe tariffs. If we don't have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100 percent. You'd call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine. And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it.  And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin, because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago. But it doesn't seem to get there. Paul, $350 billion the U.S. has already spent on this war. And so he's saying no. You guys ponied up for your percentages at the G7 summit recently. That's how they'll get paid for."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 689.594, "text": " This is where Donald Trump's straight-talking rail politic really hits the ground, and it's something he doesn't get a lot of credit for, because the foreign policy intelligentsia, this is all ironed out on the campuses and among the academics, all the think tanks, and they see Donald Trump as some sort of unwashed, uneducated character or something because he doesn't speak their language. Why? Because he speaks plainly and he goes right to the truth. Trump is the first guy that we've seen relative to the Soviet Union, which is what Putin wants to reconstitute.  He's the first guy who's taken NATO back to first principles, which is, we're all in this together, guys. And we're not going to pony up all the money for all of the defense. We've created in Europe a series of defense junkies. And they're all sitting around. I've been over there. Wow.  They're sitting around saying, don't worry about it, guys. It's OK. Because you know what? America will send the 82nd Airborne, and we'll get out of this. Take the money and put it into whatever. And very clearly, that's gone away. And you have to say to yourself, where were our NATO ambassadors all of this time? Did nobody come back?  from Europe come back from The Hague and say, Mr. President, I've got to tell you something. They're all deadbeats. They won't even put up the 2% that they're supposed to put up. You mean with the last administration? Going back even further, the German politicians literally laughed at Donald Trump first time around when he said, you're going to all be beholden to Russian  oil. As far as the tariffs go, one thing I would just say we have to be cautious about. Russia loves to say we can survive anything with self-sufficient. They'll sacrifice a whole generation over there. And they are, right now, a wartime economy. A lot of people fear that if this gets resolved, he'll start another war just to keep his economy going. So right now, the Georgians, the people in the Baltics, they're all very concerned about the fact that if you end this one, we may have another one."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 795.029, "text": " So that's really interesting, Emily, because he doesn't share a border with Germany, but he's across the Baltic Sea from Germany. And the president just said, the country that is talking so strongly about what would happen if Russia doesn't come to a deal and back down is Germany. He said, I won't tell you what we would do, but they're very bold about what they would do. And I wonder if it's not that Baltic proximity that has Germany going, we're also the ones with the most weaponry.  weaponry, rather, so on and so forth. What's your take? Yeah, I think that's why we sort of saw today the signal of this, like, hard-lined renaissance happening in the approach, and the whole point is that this is going to test the allied cohesion, indeed, absolutely that, and then the real impact of economic pressure.  To that point, will it actually work, or will Putin just spin out and start other wars? I thought what was interesting is that as we tip into this next phase, so we have military support for Ukraine. It's structured around financial accountability, and then the stick is sanctions. But the whole point is we're going to see the barriers along the way, the challenges. Do the allies have budgets? Germany has said, we are going to spend a lot.  At a certain point, there's obviously a finite end. Will the tariff timeline hold? Diplomacy with Russia may falter under inflexibility, obviously, because look at what Trump mentioned. We talk on the phone, everything's cool, and then he goes ahead and bombs everyone. So there's not a lot of predictability with that model.  predict with any type of confidence what the other person's going to do. And then I think there might be domestic criticism in just that it might undermine global diplomacy, the argument goes, and then obviously with China weighing in. So I think this is a test, but I know I have my money on the president because he won't falter.  The wild card is Putin. So the politics of this, you know, I mean, what Emily's talking about is true. It's what's going on at home and potentially what kind of pressure that can put on a deal or the president. So we know the United Senate and House can put on their 500 percent tariffs on the countries that do business with Russia. And the president said, well, Senator John Thune's coming over and we're going to talk about that. Now, I assume he means to the White House.  coming over to his house right the people's house but on top of that he says I can do my own deal so that's what you were talking about Alicia and he said and I could put that up to a hundred percent so if if people can't afford to do business with them and they can't afford to do business with us where are they gonna get their stuff  Well, I also think it's smart politically for President Trump to remove us slightly from saying, look, NATO's going to buy these weapons and then distribute them. We're not doing it. And that's also where you see President Trump not just the commander in chief, but the business guy, right? He's always looking out for the bottom line of Americans, with they're going to buy these weapons, getting Ukraine to sign a minerals deal, getting NATO to pay more, increase their spending by 5%.  So we see the business guy in President Trump. Look, I have concerns similar to what Paul expressed about, is this war never ending with Russia and Ukraine? Will it ever end? Russia has a larger military. They have more people to sacrifice at the altar of this war. However, I think President Trump deserves our deference. He's always right. When has he been wrong about foreign policy? His naysayers are the ones. Everyone said there was going to be a World War III.  after, you know, sending those bombs to Iran and taking out some of their nuclear facilities, or at least badly damaging them, that didn't come to fruition, right? So he's repeatedly been... Or, you know, moving the embassy to Jerusalem. Everyone was worried about that, right? So everyone has been wrong. He's always been right. So he deserves our deference. And then also, this is a guy who's really interested in peace, as he pointed out, ending that 30-year war between Congo and Rwanda, which he doesn't get any credit for. So, you know, look, I'm gonna wait and see on this, but I think he has earned our respect.  And he's earned our deference, because he has repeatedly been right, and his naysayers are wrong. Well, look, in India and Pakistan, that we're ready to have a hot war. He ended that in a weekend. Look, real quickly, because I think this is worth knowing. Patriot missiles in certain countries as of 2022. So who else has these, right? So some of them are in NATO, some of them are not. The US, obviously, the Netherlands, which for 14 years, Ruda was their prime minister, so we know that.  We can get a good count on them there. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been going around and calculating where all these things are. Germany has them, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Taiwan, Greece, Spain, South Korea, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Romania, Sweden, Poland, Bahrain, and Switzerland.

There are some very tough characters over there. They got it at the end of World War II. That's not that long ago in geopolitical time.

The United States, with our kinetic strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, re-established escalation dominance.  And Iran, I think, is seeking to gain some leverage to demonstrate that they could potentially hurt us in anticipation of nuclear discussions with us, negotiations over the future of their nuclear program. They don't have any other leverage. We've eliminated that. Israel has destroyed Iran's proxy terrorist network, as well as their air defenses. And we have the upper hand. And I think that's why we're seeing this threat.  I expect President Trump to be working closely with law enforcement as well as the intelligence community just to learn more details about how serious this threat is. But again, we have to be very, very vigilant."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1190.36, "text": " It sounds like that is the case. U.S. Secret Service did pass along a statement to Fox, and it reads, in part, quote, we operate in a heightened and very dynamic threat environment, and the safety and security of the president and all of our protectees remains our highest priority. To preserve operational integrity, we can't comment on specific protective intelligence matters.  However, our teams work around the clock with international, federal, state, and local partners to ensure the highest levels of protection. But to your point, Dan, this was a senior State Department official, an official statement from the State Department on this as well, saying a senior State Department official is telling the Washington Free Beacon that the Trump administration is aware of these threats and committed to, quote, holding bad actors accountable. This means using  every tool at our disposal, including sanctions, to implement the president's maximum pressure strategy.

When it comes to an Israel deal with Hamas, it's possible. But Hamas wants Israel out of the Gaza Strip, and they want a permanent ceasefire. Israel's not willing to do that.  We also don't know what the Gaza Strip is going to look like, what the day after looks like. Israel wants to ensure that there could be no future terrorist threat emanating from Gaza against Israel. And so what I expect is it's possible, through very intense diplomacy from the Trump administration, that we may arrive at some middle ground where we have a short-term ceasefire for 30 or 60 days.  a prisoner exchange where Israel releases perhaps as many as 1,000 Palestinians in return for some of the hostages who are still alive."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1320.1, "text": "This also, before I let you go, as the administration seems to be cranking up pressure on Russia, teasing this major statement or announcement, Dan, today as these drone strikes hit Ukraine, I just want to roll this on President Trump earlier on how he will respond if Putin escalates.

Thank you so much, Dan. Let's bring in now the United States Ambassador to NATO, Matt Whitaker. Thank you very much, Matt, for being here. This was President Trump, more from him, Satwan guys, on this deal. This was in the Oval Office. You were there on this weapons deal to Ukraine. More details, listen.  We've made a deal today where we're going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. The United States will not be having any payment made. We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it and they're going to be paying for it. So what do you want people to know about this deal?  Well, I think it's very important to know, first of all, the days of the United States sending unlimited taxpayer dollars to defend Ukraine are over. President Trump has made a very smart decision, an agreement with NATO, which says  Europe and Canada will pay for the weapons. The United States will manufacture them. Obviously, we make the best weapons systems in the world, and everyone wants them. And we're going to prioritize those going to Ukraine. And what this says also to Vladimir Putin, I think, is very loud and clear, which is, you know, we've given you a chance for peace. President Trump is a peacemaker. But if you want war, we will arm Ukraine, and Europe will pay for it.  It's actually, I think, a great step in ultimately bringing this war to a conclusion, to an end. In the last 18 months, Russia has gained about 1% of Ukrainian land. I mean, they're making no success. They're losing thousands of soldiers every single day. And way too many private citizens in Ukraine and the big cities are being injured. So I think this is a great next step  and finally ending this war. But again, if Vladimir Putin wants to continue to fight on the battlefields of Ukraine, the United States of America will sell Europe armaments so that they can be used by Ukraine to defend themselves. Matt, like his predecessor, Jens Stoltenberg, Mark Rutte appears to be a big fan of the president. Here's what he said after the announcement.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia. But you don't want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit.  I mean, this changes the status quo quite dramatically. It used to be that the Europeans would like to have Ukraine have weapons, but they were very happy to have the United States pay for it. Now they're ponying up for it. So that's different. But how also do you think Putin's going to react to this?  Well obviously he's going to react to not only the United States weapons being readily available to the Ukrainians at Europe's expense. He's also going to respond obviously to this tariff and especially as the people that are enabling of China India and others that are buying his oil. But you know this is a natural progression of what we did in the Hague at the NATO summit too. You know we obviously we  We move the burden off the American taxpayer for European defense and on to European taxpayers, where it should be. And the traditional defense of Europe is now going to be borne by the European population. And at the same time, we're doing the same thing with the Ukrainian war. You know, President Trump said today $350 billion of American taxpayers' money has gone to support Ukraine. No longer. But at the same time, we're not cutting them off from weapons, and we're also  also not making the United States of America less secure. We're going to make sure that strategically we have enough that we need and then anything else that we can make, manufacture and sell to our European allies and give to Ukraine I think is a perfect and elegant solution for this.  And now there's this idea of secondary tariffs, 50-day deadline. This may be the leverage that President Trump thinks he has with Vladimir Putin in Russia. And to John's point about this relationship with the NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, President Trump has spoken very highly of their relationship in the past. Here's just more of a sampling from the Oval Office, an exchange on this war, and it just keeps going on and on. Listen.  I felt, I don't know about you, Mark, but I felt that we had a deal about four times. And here we are, still talking about it. And he didn't send serious people to the negotiations. We thought, and I thought, we should have had a deal done a long time ago. But it just keeps going on and on.  Feel free to weigh in on that, Matt, but also having been in that Oval Office when all of this was going down, how important is it that they really seem to have developed a very strong relationship, the two of them?  Yeah, and obviously, Secretary, General Secretary Rutte is a very good politician. He was 14 years as the Dutch prime minister, and he knows how European politics works, and he can obviously bring people to the table in Europe. Obviously, President Trump is the master dealmaker, and I think he saw an opportunity here to not only, you know, bring jobs to middle America through making weapons systems. You know, I've seen some of those manufacturing  the U.S.  And I look, you know, every day that I work with him is enjoyable because he's such a professional and he is equally working hard to make NATO strong and make, most importantly, Europe strong. Because President Trump said it today when we were talking to him. And that is, is that a Europe, a strong Europe, a Europe that can deter Russia, frees up the United States to address all of our strategic concerns across the globe. And that's a good thing for everyone.  I mean, it is so interesting to see opponents of the president whining about him, insisting that NATO nations pony up and do their share. But the people who seem to like it are the people who are running NATO. Matt, great to catch up with you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Matt. Thank you. Meantime, senior White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich was at today's event in the Oval Office. She starts us off inside the White House briefing room. Good evening, Jackie.  Good evening, Brett. The president, who sharply criticized past assistance to Ukraine, often calling Zelensky a salesman, insulated himself from criticism over this policy shift, emphasizing that he's authorizing the sale of U.S. weapons to NATO allies, whose leaders he also praised after they stepped up their defense commitments. We had a deal about four times.  President Trump is stepping up Ukraine's defenses with billions of dollars worth of US weapons bought and distributed by NATO allies. Trump now fed up with Putin's games. My conversations with him are always very pleasant. When I tell the first lady, you know, I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation. She said, oh, really?  Another city was just hit. So it's like, look, he's, I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. Trump also giving Putin 50 days to reach a deal or face 100% secondary sanctions on any country doing business with Russia, a hefty consequence for major purchasers of Russian oil like China and India. The package is separate from the 500% secondary sanctions leaders in the Senate and House have been withholding for Trump's green light.  I'm not sure we need it, but it's certainly good that they're doing it. And I think they've actually crafted a pretty good piece of legislation that's probably going to pass very easily, and that includes Democrats. The president said Ukraine should begin receiving Patriot missile systems within days, replacements now heading to NATO countries as soon as this afternoon, a major development after the Pentagon briefly paused arms deliveries for a stockpile review early this month, an apparent surprise to the president. So who ordered the pause last week?  I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Trump indicated today this impending deal played a role. I knew what Pete was doing was evaluation because we knew this was going to happen. Obviously, that has a big impact on, you know, when you say a pause. Obviously, you're not going to be doing things if you don't know what's going to happen here. But we were pretty sure this was going to happen, so we did a little bit of a pause.  A White House official tells Fox the president ordered a review of U.S. stockpiles following the Iran strikes, and Pentagon officials believed that they were adhering to the president's wishes when they paused those arms deliveries for the purposes of that review, but there was no broader policy decision to pause military aid to Ukraine. Brett.  Jack Hanrak, live in the White House Briefing Room. Jackie, thank you. You think that the sanctions on other countries doing deals with Russia will create additional pressure, exponential? Absolutely. This is significant. So today, if you are in Beijing, or in Delhi, or you're in Brazil, and you know that this is coming to you, you might want to call Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and say, hey, friend, we are still buying stuff from you. But you have got to get serious when it comes to these negotiations on a ceasefire or a peace deal. Or otherwise, we get hit.  by the secondary sanctions.  President Trump stepping up the pressure there. You see the NATO Secretary General on set. Axios writes it this way, Trump to supply missiles to Ukraine gives Russia a 50-day ultimatum. This is a seismic policy shift from President Trump, who originally refused to side with Ukraine and until very recently insisted he would only supply defensive weapons so as not to escalate the war. Trump also said he was giving Russia 50 days to make a deal or else face 100% secondary tariffs, seemingly referring to a plan to impose tariffs on countries like China and India.  that by Russian oil, that would have a major impact on global oil markets. With that, let's bring in our panel, Fox News contributor Mary Catherine Hamm, Dasha Burns, White House Bureau Chief for Politico, and Guy Benson, also a Fox News contributor. All right, Mary Catherine, seems like it is a big turning point and may make a big difference.  Yeah, I went back to 2018 actually to reflect on how we got here when Trump first went to NATO and five countries were committing 2% at that point. And now you've got this big shift that the Secretary General noted with everybody but Spain saying we can get to 5%. And I think that's interesting because I was a person who back then thought, was worried about his rhetoric on NATO and who still worries about his rhetoric on Ukraine and Russia. But he has created a situation where he can do this deal that puts pressure on  Putin, because I think he feels like he's been worked over a little bit in that area. And he can do it in a way that is politically fine for him to do, even with his base, because Europe is paying for it, and strategically helpful to Ukraine, which is what I'm looking for. Yeah. Dasha, it is a change for this White House in positioning. And the question is, what happens after the 50 days? Does he agree to this Lindsey Graham bipartisan bill to put the pressure on, or does he do it himself?  Well, I just spoke to a senior White House official about just that, Brett. And the point here is I asked whether the shift was due to something. Did Putin say something? Did something happen? And they said, no, look, it's just time. And Russia at this point is now committing some of the worst atrocities against civilians of this entire war. And Trump feels like he's been tapped along by Putin. At the same time, Trump does feel like  Putin is the bigger fish with the upper hand here, and so he doesn't want to go full blunt force trauma against Russia right away, which is why we've really seen him hedge on this idea of sanctions. What I know is behind the scenes, the White House is very much in contact with Lindsey Graham about this, but they want the language change to give Trump the ultimate say, to give him the maximum optionality so that it's on the table, he can threaten Putin with it, but if Putin comes to the negotiating table in full good faith, then maybe it's a different story.  You know, the NATO Secretary General said the president gave Putin chances on multiple phone calls, but then noticed the attacks that came right after those phone calls as an affront to him and to the thought that he's going to get to the table. And he, frankly, was angry about it."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2156.283, "text": "Yeah. I think the NATO chief, to make this point, is very good.

Especially when you think about elitists in Europe, right? The default setting has been vis-a-vis President Trump. Smug, condescension, sneering.

But Trump's DOJ and FBI have concluded that there's no evidence for either. Mary Catherine.  Yeah, I think there's a couple things going on here. Many, many, many people look at this and go, on its face, it looks like it was handled at least incompetently, if not corruptly, from day one, regardless of leadership. And they want answers because there are real victims who we will probably never know much about because they signed NDAs and because very powerful people were involved.  And also, there was an easy answer for the Trump administration here, which was, Ghislaine Maxwell is appealing. We cannot release anything while that is ongoing, right? I think that would have been the clean answer. Now they're in this situation where a bunch of people are deeply invested in this particular story, which there may be plenty more to, as a decoder ring for all that is corrupt in government. And if they don't get answers on that, they'll be very mad. Here's the other thing, though. There's a large portion of that portion of the base that will listen to Trump when they give him, when he gives them an answer on this.  And the question is, how politically salient is that? And does he have the benefit of the doubt?  Here's the tension. The White House wants to move on from this. One senior official tells me that they understand it's important to the base, and that doesn't mean they're going to ignore it, but they want to move past it. They also feel like this is very much an online kind of outrage, not that the issue is not important to the base, but that the outcry and the rage factor is very much an online thing led by these influencers. But the reality of it is that the people in Middle America that voted for Trump  are not as invested in this as they are in the economy and health care. The other piece of it is, the more that this administration doesn't want to talk about this, the more that online group wants to talk about it and shout about it and feels like there's more of a there there.

They have been firing missiles at a rate never seen before in the three years of the war. And it almost seems like Putin has been pursuing this mad moment, if you will,  of sending as many of these things as possible. And they're not all aimed at military targets, primarily hitting civilian targets, things like that. Other things that are on the order going out are what they call defensive weapons. Now, there's a lot of interpretation on what that can mean, but artillery rounds  certainly are well in there and you know I would mention we've sent about 3 million artillery rounds over to Ukraine during the course of war so that's something they desperately need. Certain types of HIMARS may be on the list, I think they are. There are some, there's a version  of a new missile that we have that can be fired through the HIMARS system. We haven't even sent that to our closest allies in NATO yet, but that's something Ukraine has asked for. It has about a 500 kilometer range. If that thing gets released, that's a significant shift in US policy. But basically all the things that you would expect, and mostly ammunition type stuff.

I've heard of a few other countries that are in, that are paying, that will be paying for buying those weapons from the U S now the question, uh, comes to my mind is what will we charge?  It might be we charge a very discount rate for this purpose as well. That's very possible. There is a lot of latitude on what we can charge for weapons, and certainly if it's something we have in the inventory, what we can charge. But this is actually kind of going back to something we've heard from President Trump and those around him for quite some time, is that the European countries need to start pulling their weight and providing more support for NATO.  What this does is it addresses a defense industrial base shortfall within Europe. I'm not saying the U.S. is healthy in this regard. We have a lot of work to do to rebuild our defense industrial base, but Europe is much further behind us. So they're not in a position where they can suddenly start producing weapons at the rate to support Ukraine with what Ukraine needs. So now it's okay.

That's been drawing down. There's not a lot of that fun left, but there still was some of that fun left. So some of those weapons, particularly the Patriot missiles, are from that. Now, the thing they just announced, this is new.  This will be on top of whatever that is. And I will say the Europeans have been stepping up really fast. In fact, I saw an estimate some weeks back that said they'd actually filled the gap in terms of contribution towards buying weapons for Ukraine that the U.S. used to fill.  And so that was pretty big. But this actually addresses that other problem, which is how do you get the weapons? And again, it goes back to the ability of these NATO European countries to produce weapons that Ukraine needs. And particularly the fact is, you know, a Patriot missile, there's only one place you get a Patriot missile. That's from the U.S. All right. That's our missile. So they have to get that.

It's been helping their economies because they're able to buy this cheap Russian oil. Of course, it's dangerous for the whole world because the Russians ship it in these, what they call shadow tankers, these dilapidated old tankers that are not particularly seaworthy. And they're running around the world with their automated identification systems turned off because they don't want anybody to know that they're  extremely dangerous for maritime commerce. Basically, what this would do is potentially shut that whole thing down, and that would cause a massive crunch in revenue going to Russia. Russia is, to use the late Senator John McCain's expression, is basically a big gas station. They are a petrostate.  And they are running out of places they can sell their oil. And this makes them run out of pretty much every place that they can sell their oil. So that's part of it.

And something that's very interesting is that Biden's use of the auto pen stems far back into the early days of his presidency, whenever he was signing proclamations at first. It really wasn't until, I believe, the first year of his presidency, I believe on a trip to Israel where he used the auto pen  kind of as it is usually intended for, which is to sign legislation while you're away from the office. But as it turns out, we began to see later into Biden's presidency, there were days whenever he was even at the White House,  where he was having the auto pen being signed. That's according to information that's been obtained and released from the Oversight Project, formerly part of the Heritage Foundation, but they uncovered on at least seven different occasions. There were times whenever Biden was working at the Oval Office, but he still had things signed with auto pen. Therein lies where Republicans start to get suspicious because they think to themselves, kind of like we were just mentioning before, if it's supposed to be something that is convenient and for ease,  Well, one can make also an argument that it's just as easy to use your own hand to sign a signature on something, especially if you're at work that day. So I think that that's where people start, especially Republicans, start to look at the issue and wonder to themselves, was there something else happening here? Were there more aides that were doing this, perhaps unbeknownst to the president? And I think that that's where, especially Republicans like, say in Comer's camp,  want to see the Justice Department look into this as well. And I'll say this, you know, last week, whenever we saw Biden's doctor plead the fifth, there was a bit of a discussion about whether I remember Mike Lee, Senator Mike Lee from Utah was asking, why don't we just give Biden's doctor immunity if he's going to plead the fifth?

The mayor of Pembroke Pine says there have been more than 35 crashes over the past five years involving that airport. He's calling on Broward County to launch a full investigation. Tom? Incredible. Everyone survived there, Tom. Thank you.  Okay, to the Grand Canyon now, where two wildfires are burning out of control, forcing hundreds of evacuations and destroying dozens of structures, including the iconic Grand Canyon Lodge. Steve Patterson is at the Historic National Park with the latest. Steve, we can still see that thick black smoke behind you. Tom, from here, you can see it, you can feel it, and right now, crews are fighting against it on the cliffs of a six-million-year-old canyon.

OK, we want to head to Texas now, where there are new concerns as heavy rains threaten to bring more flooding to the areas hardest hit by those recent deadly storms. This as new reporting reveals details about the response to the floods at Camp Mystic, where dozens tragically lost their life. NBC's Morgan Chesky has more.  Tonight, dangerous downpours threatening the Texas Hill Country, with flood watches covering areas in recovery mode. The death toll statewide from the flooding, now more than 130 people, as new details emerge about the crucial moments the waters rose.  at 1.14 a.m. on July 4th. A family spokesman tells NBC News Dick Eastland, the owner of Camp Mystic, received a National Weather Service alert on his cell phone. The spokesman says Eastland then walked outside to assess the property, called family on walkie-talkies, and between 2 and 2.30 a.m., staff began moving campers to the Mystic Rec Hall. Eastland later died in the floods.  Following the tragic loss of life, growing scrutiny over the lack of warnings from officials, who are the only ones able to tell residents to evacuate or shelter in place. It wasn't like a tornado. It wasn't like a hurricane even. It lasted all day. We asked Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice on who has authority to issue alerts at a city level.  What person would that be? So ultimately, it's me. Ultimately, I have the ultimate authority to be able to make those decisions based on that. Rice adding he was managing rescues and says other local officials can also blast out citywide warnings. Did you issue one? Yeah. So I did not. But that does not mean that something did or did not get issued. I don't know. We haven't dove into looking at the after action stuff. Officials say full reviews are still coming. Until then, the search for the missing, now in its second week.  These divers clearing off debris above before scouring the murky depths below. A painstaking process for closure that may never come. And Morgan joins us tonight live from Kerrville, Texas. Morgan, what do those flood warnings tonight mean for the search and recovery effort?  Yeah, Tom, well, authorities have said that volunteers needed to vacate this river area because the levels are still high. They're telling all of those individuals to stay on higher ground. But as for the search and rescue crews or recovery crews, unfortunately, you can see they are still absolutely in this river, even though that there are hazards beneath the water here, Tom. They have been scouring this stretch of the riverbank here on the Guadalupe. And unfortunately, Tom, with more rain in the forecast, that could pose an issue for them.  But just a testament to their tireless work. And you have yet another helicopter flying up above us. Tom, it feels like this has really been a nonstop effort since this flood began, now 11 days ago here. Unfortunately, that number missing, not dropping as fast as families would like. But the one thing we continue to hear from these crews that are out on this river every single day is they're going to stay here as long as it takes to try to make that closure happen here. Tom?  All right, Morgan Chesky for us. Morgan, we thank you for that. I want to get right over to NBC New York meteorologist Violeta Yaas, who joins us tonight here on Top Stories. So it has been relentless for parts of Texas right now, and millions across the East Coast are at risk for flash floods. What are you tracking tonight?  It has been a very rough rush hour across the northeastern U.S. with torrential, slow-moving downpours now advancing across that I-95 corridor. You can see numerous flash flood warnings in effect. We're seeing not only that, but we've got flood watches in effect through this evening, impacting 46 million people. You can see that really includes that whole I-95 corridor. So we've been seeing this all afternoon long.  This is going to be the focus through the next couple of hours. It's not just the amount of rain, but the fact that these thunderstorms are very slow moving in a very densely populated area of the country, the most densely populated area. So this has been causing big issues as delays have been piling up here across some of our major airports, D.C., Baltimore, up through Philadelphia, Newark, LaGuardia and JFK as well. So very stormy afternoon.  We can expect potentially significant flooding here. That's going to be the bullseye area, unfortunately, from D.C. up through Philadelphia into the New York City area as well. In terms of how much rain we're talking, you can see a general injure or so, but locally in some of those heavier downpours.  We're talking totals on the order of three to five inches of rain, certainly enough to cause flooding, especially when you're talking about a short period of time. So expect very difficult travel here through the next several hours. It's certainly a situation where if you don't need to be heading out the door, you definitely don't want to do that. So very unsettled weather here through this evening, very heavy downpours in the forecast here, really through tonight before conditions start to improve as we head into tomorrow.  All right, Violeta, let's talk about the Gulf now and what's happening just off the east coast of Florida, but why we're tracking it tonight.  Yeah, I actually do have an update for you. We now have tropical disturbance at 93 L invest that essentially formalizes this as an area that we're going to be watching. Still hasn't developed into a tropical storm or anything like that, but conditions are going to be favorable through the next couple of days. So this is going to be tracking across Florida into the Gulf the next couple of days. So if it does intensify, this would become Dexter through the remainder of this week.  Now, the rainfall totals here, you can see on the order of three to five inches locally, even more from parts of central and southern Florida, extending right through the panhandle into the remainder of the Gulf States. So this is an area that does need to be on alert through the next couple of days. Is there enough room, enough time for this to sort of develop into something potentially deadly?  We do have some time for this to intensify. It's possible. It doesn't necessarily do so before tracking across Florida. But once this moves into the Gulf and we've seen this time and time again, those very warm water temperatures, conditions are favorable in this particular area for that intensification. So we'll need to watch out for that. But another thing we've seen through the last several years is that you don't want to get too hung up on the exact categorization because this is going to provide  very heavy rainfall, and the potential for flooding in all of these areas, regardless of whether or not it does formally intensify into a tropical storm eventually. All right, Violeta, yes, we thank you so much for being here tonight. In Washington, President Trump announcing a new plan to rearm Ukraine as Russia intensifies its attacks on the country.

Maggie joins us now live. Maggie, a couple questions for you. First, you mentioned that state trooper who was shot and injured. And then I was also thinking about what you just reported there at the end. How did he get all these weapons if he had these prior convictions? Tom, we know of one possibility. We talked about that protective order that reportedly an ex-girlfriend just filed here earlier this month. In it, she wrote, among the other factors that kind of tie to his escalating behavior, she said that he had broken into her home and stolen her guns  plural. Now, police were asked today whether or not they knew or could say whether where he got his weapons and they declined to do so. So we can't definitively tie that to the shooting, but obviously it's a distinct possibility based on that document. As far as the trooper is concerned, authorities are not naming him, but just saying that he has serious injuries. But tonight an update is stable and recovering at a local hospital.

The Supreme Court today said President Donald Trump may proceed with his plans to carry out mass layoffs at the Department of Education in the latest win for the White House. The justice is lifting a lower court ruling that put an indefinite pause on Trump's plan while legal challenges play out.  Trump ordered mass layoffs at the department earlier this year, cutting its workforce in half. But lower courts have blocked that effort, noting that the education department was created by Congress in a scathing dissent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision, quote, indefensible. Here in New York City, four kids were spotted by police drones riding on top of train cars. It's a dangerous trend known as subway surfing. Two of the boys were only 12 years old.  hard to believe. Police boarded the train and all four kids were taken into custody. The incident comes after a 15-year-old boy was killed on July 4th while subway surfing. Police and MTA officials believe the practice has increased in recent years due to social media urging people not to glamorize it. Former Major League Baseball player Dan Serafini has been found guilty  of murdering his father-in-law and trying to murder his mother-in-law after a 2021 Tahoe area home ambush and shooting. The motive, according to the prosecution, was rooted in longstanding family tensions and financial disputes. Key testimony came from Serafini's wife, Erin Spore, who said she didn't believe the family's disagreements could lead her husband to commit murder. In addition to murder and attempted murder, Serafini was found guilty of first-degree burglary. His sentencing set for August 18th.  And police in Richmond Heights, Ohio, capturing the moment three women twerked on a cop cruiser, then using a facial recognition platform, they identified them. Take a look at this. So dash cam video shows a woman climbing onto the car with others. Later joining police say the brazen act, which involved this type of dancing you see here, happened back in June. It damaged the vehicles because of that twerking with dents and scratches. A detective telling us with the use of Clearview AI facial recognition, they were able to identify  to identify two of the women who were twerking. Warrants are out for their arrest. They're still searching for a third. Okay, and a paraglider making it out unscathed after a run-in with a power line in North Dakota. This is pretty incredible. The paraglider flying steadily until you see this coming in close with those power lines, setting off the sparks, then plunges into the Red River. Crews are able to rescue the paraglider, helping him to get to shore. Thankfully, he was unharmed. Incredible he survived that. Okay, to Atlanta now in a major theft.  music world. Atlanta police say hard drives containing unreleased Beyonce music were stolen during a car break-in last week. The hard drives also included footage plans for Queen B's show and future set lists. For more on this, I want to bring in NBC's Priscilla Thompson, a proud member of the Beehive. Priscilla, thank you for this. So talk to us more about the break-in. I mean, this could be pretty huge, especially if it is all of Beyonce's stuff and they end up putting it somewhere on the Internet.  Yeah, Tom, incredibly huge, especially for such a high profile celebrity as Beyonce. We have obtained the incident report that shows that this happened last Tuesday, just as she was kicking off her Atlanta leg of the Cowboy Carter tour. And it happened at Crog Street Market, which is this very popular food hall in Atlanta. Now, according to Beyonce's choreographer, Christopher Grant, and also a dancer, D'Andre Bleu, they pulled into this market at around eight o'clock at night  An hour later, they went out to the car, and they noticed that the window towards the trunk was damaged. And they found that two suitcases were missing. And inside those suitcases were hard drives that contained watermarked music, unreleased music, footage plans for past and future shows, and also set lists.  We know that in addition to all of those very important things to Beyonce, I'm sure there were also laptops, headphones, different kinds of electronics. So lots of questions about why that would have been left in a vehicle in a parking garage, but definitely not something that such a high profile celebrity would want to fall into the wrong hands. Yeah, no, I hear you. And Priscilla, do we think this was random or do we think that they were targeted, like they knew these people worked for Beyonce?  That is definitely the big question. Now, police have not said whether it was random or targeted. But what is interesting that, you know, a lot of folks have the Find My app that connects all of their Apple electronics. And so police were actually able to ping the headphones and the computers, and they sent out, like, multiple units to this area. We know that they interviewed a man in this area and that they were also looking at a vehicle that appeared to be moving as the items that they were tracking were also moving.  And what's more, there is video, police say, that this parking garage had video cameras. The entire incident was caught on video. We know that they took fingerprints at the garage. And police have said that they have issued a warrant for the arrest of the suspect. But they say that an I.D. is, quote, not yet available for release. So unclear if they have that identity and just aren't releasing it to the public yet. But, obviously, it comes as Beyonce is  probably about to take the stage any minute now for her final concert in Atlanta before the tour moves on. Tom? Yep. All right, Priscilla Thompson, we appreciate that reporting. Next tonight to Tesla's new legal battle over its autopilot driving system. A 2019 Florida case where a woman was killed when a Tesla crashed into her parked car, now at the center of a federal trial. The jury seated today must decide if the company bears responsibility for the fatal accident. NBC's George Solis has some of the details.  Tonight, Tesla on trial. In a first for Elon Musk's electric car company, Tesla will now have to defend itself before a federal jury against claims its driver assistance technology is to blame for a deadly 2019 crash in the Florida Keys. Those fateful moments caught on the Tesla's own cameras. In a lawsuit brought by the victim's family, the plaintiff's attorneys say the driver was using the electric car's autopilot, which failed to detect the substantial profile of the Chevy SUV parked at an intersection.  It goes on to say the vehicle struck the Tahoe at almost 70 miles per hour, causing it to violently rotate.

The Tesla's driver admitting to taking his eyes off the road moments before the crash as he searched for his phone, according to court documents. The core of the case centering on whether Tesla is liable when its autopilot tech is involved in a crash and how it was marketed to drivers, according to the lawsuit.  In 2016, the company posting this video of a Tesla appearing to drive itself. The text on screen reading, the person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself. Today, the company warns that autopilot is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel. Tesla has denied responsibility for the 2019 crash. In a statement to NBC News, Tesla says in part, the crash had nothing to do with Tesla's autopilot technology,  Instead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cell phones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver. Tesla's autopilot system has faced legal challenges as recent as last year. In three separate California cases, Tesla either settled or was found not liable. Getting into the robo-taxi. The outcome could not only threaten Tesla's reputation, but also impact its self-driving footprint as it begins a push for robo-taxis nationally. Musk himself did not appear in the courtroom today.  All right, with that, George Solis joins us tonight from Miami. So, George, the jury already seated today. What do we know about the makeup of the jury, and how long do we expect this trial involving Tesla to last? Yeah, Tom, the jury was just elected in a couple of hours. It's made up of six women and three men, and some of them were weeded out during some of the questioning, saying they couldn't participate because of their feelings about Elon Musk. Others saying they were just supporters of Tesla and Elon. Now, this whole trial is expected to take about three weeks.  Tom. All right, George Solis first. George, thank you.

He was out interacting with the public. And today in that video and in a statement that Cuomo sent out to his supporters, he basically said that he was not aggressive enough  in that early campaign. And so he seems to be trying to take on a different approach. The other thing that was notable in the comments that he made in that video is he talked about affordability, which was really the hallmark of the Mamdani campaign. It wasn't necessarily something that Cuomo made front and center of his. So is he adopting some of that language? That seems to be somewhat of the approach here.  Does he have a point, though? I mean, if only 12% of the voting electorate participated in that primary election, I mean, is there a chance? He's got a chance.  I mean, he comes in as basically the most well-known man in New York City, arguably, though Mamdani, if you look at some of the preliminary polling, and it's very preliminary, still has the edge here. The major foil for Cuomo is that he is seemingly fighting for the same pool of voters as some of the other unaffiliated candidates or third-party candidates that are in this race, including the sitting mayor, Eric Adams.  as well as a Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa. And so if they're all fighting for the same piece of the pie, that does give Mamdani, it seems, again, preliminary polling, but does give him certainly a lane where he can kind of fight for his own way to win this. And if you have so many candidates, you don't have to get 50% to win, you just need to have the most.  Yeah, let's talk about a controversy involving Mamdani right now. He's facing the past few weeks. He has said previously that he doesn't consider himself black or African-American, despite being born in Uganda and living there for years. And yet, the New York Times has learned through hacked documents shared with the paper, Mamdani identified as both Asian and African-American on an application to Columbia University. Mamdani, of course, put his Muslim faith and South Asian descent front and center in his campaign. How is this revelation playing with New Yorkers?  There certainly seems to be some voters that are saying this is a bit of a bridge too far, but this of course does come in as Mondani has faced criticism on various other fronts, including his lack of a desire, or at least a lack of willingness, to condemn, for example, the idea of globalize the Intifada. There are these various aspects of Mondani that some voters are clearly not very comfortable with. One of the things that he is trying to do right now, and he's doing this to some degree with some success,  is to basically get all of the mainstream front and center Democrats behind him as they go into now the general campaign. Whereas Cuomo had a lot of endorsements from, for example, labor unions and other groups during the primary, they're now lining up behind Mamdani.  One of the key folks to keep an eye on, at least that I'm watching here in Washington, is Congressman Hakeem Jeffries and Senator Chuck Schumer. Jeffries is not yet endorsed, nor has Schumer, and Jeffries is set to have a conversation with Mamdani in person at the end of the week. Obviously, he is the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, could be Speaker of the House, depending on how some key races fall next year. When Mayor Eric Adams ran and won, he ran on crime. He's a former police officer. What is the top issue, you think, in this race?  At this point, at least it seems, and if anything you can take away from the primary, it seems that affordability is front and center. Whereas back in 2022 or 2020, what year is it now? 2021 rather, really front and center was we were coming out of the COVID pandemic. There was a peak in crime. And so part of Adams' successful message as a former member of the NYPD was I'm going to push back on crime.  Now we've kind of turned the corner on some of those crime rates, and it seems that the affordability crisis, the inability to afford rent, and so forth, might be really the defining mark for this race. It's going to be an interesting race, and there's a lot of months. I'm sure there'll be investigations and articles and a lot of opal research in that time. So great to have you on the show tonight, Kevin Frey. We appreciate it.  No problem, Tom. Elmo's World now causing controversy. The ex-account for the beloved Sesame Street character posting a string of racist and anti-Semitic comments over the weekend. Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind the popular children's show confirming Elmo's account, had been hacked.  NBC's Melanie Zenona has been following this for a while and joins me now. Melanie, thanks for joining Top Story tonight. I thought Elmo might be too young to be on X, but apparently not. He has an account. In all seriousness, though, break down this for us and also why this is so sad, right, for X.  Yeah, this all started on Sunday when Elmo's account began posting this very hateful and racist content. It also posted some derogatory comments about President Donald Trump in connection to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Now, we should know that NBC News was not able to independently verify these posts before they were deleted. But Sesame Workshop, that's the nonprofit behind Elmo and Sesame Street, did put out a statement confirming that the account was hacked, although it is still unclear at this point who was behind the hack. I want to read you part of their statement. They said,  Elmo's ex-account was compromised today by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including anti-Semitic and racist posts. We are working to restore full control of the account.\" And since that statement, it does appear that they have been able to regain control and secure that account. The posts were deleted. His bio, Elmo's bio, was restored. But this caused quite the nightmare on Sesame Street. A beloved Muppet in character  that really did, you know, he's done these other things in the past, gone viral for starting a mental health conversation, saying, Elmo checking in, how are you doing? So just a very sad sort of situation to see play out here. Yeah, those hackers are pretty heartless. I do want to ask you, this is sort of the second or third or fourth hate speech scandal to hit X in under a week, coming just days after Elon Musk's AI chatbot made a series of anti-Semitic posts which have since been deleted. Does Elon Musk or the team behind X show any signs of cracking down?  Well the AI company that's behind Grok did issue apology for what they called horrific behavior on the platform. The company also said they did conduct an internal investigation and they determined that the root cause was an update to the code path upstream of the Grok bot. However it isn't clear what additional measures or crackdowns they're going to take.  to prevent this from happening again. And this is not the first time that we've actually seen this type of hateful comments popping up on the GROK chat bot itself. And so there is also going to be a resignation we already saw from X, the CEO of X, stepping down. They also did introduce a new version of GROK, GROK4, right after  these alarming posts, but there are still calls for more accountability to prevent the platform from not only spreading this hate speech, but from providing it itself. Yeah, and before you go, Mellie, since we have you here, it's sort of in the same vein. All of this happening as the Senate is expected to vote this week on whether or not to take back funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports children's programming like Sesame Street. Is there any talk of a possible connection here to this?  Well, these cuts had actually been in the work for quite some time on Capitol Hill. Both PBS and NPR have been top targets of Trump, who's really pushing Congress to get this over the finish line and get it to its desk this week. But Tom, I got to tell you, there are Republicans who have concerns with this bill. There are Republicans like Susan Collins who have concerns with the cuts to foreign aid programs. And then you have other Republicans who are concerned with the cuts to PBS and NPR, which they say are crucial.  to providing not only news, but also weather alerts to rural areas, which, of course, is top of mind after those horrific floods in Texas last week. So we could see some changes to the bill. If that happens, though, it needs to go back to the House. And the time is ticking here because Congress has a deadline of needing to act by July 19th, which is Friday.  All right, Melanie, we thank you for having on Top Story tonight. Up next, what might be the strangest bust you'll ever hear about. German officials foiling a plan to smuggle 1,500 tarantulas into the country. And you won't believe where they found them. Plus, pediatricians sounding the alarm over nicotine poisonings in children. The number of kids getting sick from nicotine pouches and other products skyrocketing. What parents need to know. That's coming up right here on Top Story.  We're back now with Top Story's Global Watch, and we begin in South Korea, where officials there are ordering airlines operating Boeing aircraft to inspect fuel cutoff switches. The mandate comes amid safety concerns raised about the airplane parts after the deadly Air India crash. Officials have now provided a timeline for inspections. In 2018, the FAA recommended inspections of the switches on Boeing models, including the 787.  Officials in Germany foiled a plan to smuggle 1,500, get this, young tarantulas into the country inside sponge cake. The eight-legged venomous creatures were discovered in chocolate cake boxes shipped from Vietnam to Cologne's airport. Many of the spiders did not survive the trip. Those that did were given to an expert handler. Criminal proceedings have been filed against the intended recipient.  All right, and France celebrating its largest national holiday, Bastille Day, with festivities nationwide. In Paris, at least 7,000 marchers in a parade along the Champs-Elysees with horseback riders and armored vehicles. A drone show, I should say, happening over the Eiffel Tower and fireworks in nearly every city. The holiday marks the day Parisians stormed the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, sparking, of course, the French Revolution.  At a Top Stories health check and an urgent new warning for parents, the number of babies and toddlers with illnesses related to nicotine products has skyrocketed. A new study from the Medical Journal of Pediatrics say more than 130,000 cases of nicotine poisoning in kids under the age of six were recorded from 2010 to 2023. Most of the cases attributed to contact with products like  nicotine pouches and vape e-liquids. For more on what you can do to protect your kids from exposure and sickness, let's bring in NBC News Medical Contributor, Dr. Natalie Azar. Natalie, so great to see you. I want to give this stat to our viewers because this is one of the reasons why we're doing it. The number of nicotine poisoning shot up almost by seven, it shot up 763% in kids in just three years. So how are these kids ending up sick from nicotine and is it those zinc pouches that have become so popular?  Yeah, well, I mean, I agree, Tom, that I think we've seen a significant rise in the popularity of a lot of different products in lieu of people smoking cigarettes, including these nicotine pouches, as well as vapes. And they're almost really ubiquitous.  I think, you know, children are uniquely susceptible to toxicity from these, Tom, given simply their size. The average amount of nicotine that is contained, let's say, in a pouch of Zin, is anywhere from about one and a half to 15 milligrams of nicotine. But as little as one to two milligrams can be toxic to a toddler, as opposed to really a much, much higher amount that adults can tolerate before they can experience toxicity.  But I guess the big question is, Dr. Azar, why are kids getting into them? Is there something that these nicotine products now look like that they didn't look like before?  So kids have always been susceptible to putting things in their mouths that they shouldn't. You know, it's not necessarily that they're flavored. You know, we talk about that a lot with vaping and with teens. But I think it's just, it's something small lying around the house. Children are going to put that in their mouths quite simply. That can suck on them. It's exactly the right size or the wrong size, you know, for exposure if you have little ones in the house, Tom.  Dr. Azar, if your child does suffer from nicotine poisoning, what are some of the symptoms and do you call 911? Should you rush your child to the ER?  Yeah, so in the first couple of minutes after exposure, Tom, some of the symptoms could include sweating, agitation, nausea, vomiting, a high heart rate. But after that, that's when it gets kind of critical, where children can experience a drop in blood pressure, a drop in their heart rate, and even coma. And so if you ever are suspicious about any kind of exposure or ingestion of nicotine with those early signs or symptoms that I mentioned, you need to call 911 immediately.  All right, Dr. Azar, always a pleasure to have you on Top Story. We thank you so much. We learned a lot here. When Top Story returns, some hope in the midst of heartache. The Texas camp that gave children with disabilities a place to belong nearly wiped out by the floods until an army of volunteers stepped in to help. Their story's coming up next.

The spokesman says Eastland then walked outside to assess the property, called family on walkie-talkies, and between 2 and 2.30 a.m., staff began moving campers to the Mystic Rec Hall. Eastland later died in the floods.  Following the tragic loss of life, growing scrutiny over the lack of warnings from officials, who are the only ones able to tell residents to evacuate or shelter in place. It wasn't like a tornado. It wasn't like a hurricane even. It lasted all day. We asked Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice on who has authority to issue alerts at a city level. And who, what person would that be? So ultimately, ultimately it's me.  Ultimately, I have the ultimate authority to be able to make those decisions based on. Rice adding he was managing rescues and says other local officials can also blast out citywide warnings. Did you issue one? Yeah. So I did not. But that does not mean that something did or did not get issued. I don't know. We haven't dove into looking at the after action stuff. Officials say full reviews are still coming.

Next, our NBC News exclusive, the parents of one of the four murdered Idaho college students speaking out about that chilling confession, their reaction to seeing Brian Coburger for the first time just ahead.  Now to our NBC News exclusive, the parents of Ethan Chapin, one of the four victims in the Idaho College murders case, speaking out about the moment they saw their son's killer in court. Here's Liz Kreutz. He's going to get what's coming to him. I really don't care what happens to the guy. He's off the streets. He can't hurt any more kids.  Jim and Stacey Chapin say they can finally breathe again, knowing that Brian Koberger, the man who killed their son, his girlfriend, Zanna Kernodal, and her housemates, Kaley Gonzalez and Madison Mogan, will spend the rest of his life behind bars. Did you kill and murder Ethan Chapin, a human being? Yes.  Koberger recently pled guilty in a deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty and gave the parents the assurance he'll never be allowed to appeal. The Chapin spoke to NBC exclusively for the first time since that chilling confession. Was that your first time seeing Brian Koberger in person? Yes. What was that like? Honestly, I really didn't give it a thought, because it doesn't matter. It's done. It's just shocking, the wreckage that is that person.  Their focus now, remembering Ethan. His parents and triplet siblings, Maisie and Hunter, reflect on his life in a new Amazon Prime documentary, One Night in Idaho. Ethan was definitely like the leader. Like I would go to him and Hunter would go to him. We were raised very centered around family. So we were friends with everyone, but we were best friends with each other.  The family remembers their best friend by holding on to things he loved. Ethan's Jeep still parked in the garage. It was just so him. I mean, he even had the flag and the grill. In what ways do you feel Ethan's presence? Everywhere in this house.  I mean, he just could just blow into any room and had something funny to say. We feel very fortunate to have had him for 20 years. Is closure a word you could use to describe the plea deal for your family? Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Now we get to just move on. Yeah. Yeah, there's big time closure.  Liz Kreutz, NBC News. When we come back, the stunning moment a paraglider crashed into power lines, then fell into a river. The miracle rescue, next.  We're back now with a stunning moment caught on camera. Take a look at this. A paraglider in North Dakota crashing into power lines, sending sparks flying, then plunging down into the river below. The fire department told local media they were able to rescue the paraglider from that water. The person who took this video confirming the man somehow survived.  Here in New York City, four kids were spotted by police drones riding on top of train cars, a dangerous trend known as subway surfing. Two of the boys are only 12 years old. Police boarded that train, and all four kids were taken into custody. Earlier this month, a teen died after being found on top of a train car. Police believe he had been trying to subway surf.  Beyonce's Cowboy Carter tour is one of the hottest shows of the summer. But during a stop in Atlanta, two people identifying themselves to police as members of Beyonce's team said their car was broken into and that hard drives with future set list and unreleased music were stolen.

And we just signed, President Trump just signed the most significant piece of tax legislation in American history, the largest tax cut.  For working and middle class families, that means more money directly into the pockets of every single American watching your show tonight.

That man is working around the clock. He hardly ever sleeps. He's constantly thinking about not just the problems in our country here, but around this world and how to solve them. And look at what he's done on the world stage with bringing peace to the Middle East,  withdrawing Russia and Ukraine to actually talk directly for the first time in this war in years.

I think the bigger, broader question here, though,  is that Trump has not shown a lot of interest in trying to really stick it to the Russians, economically or militarily. He has not demonstrated in the past a lot of support for Ukraine. If that is shifting, the question is how far does that shift? I think what we've seen is a partial shift,  The US now looks like it's going to continue military supplies.

And then the economic question is, how much of an economic hit is the president willing to absorb to stick it to the Russians in support of Ukraine? There's limits to what the Biden administration would do.  So I do have some doubts about how far we are willing to go. And I think Russia may just try to call our bluff here. And it'll be really interesting when the 50 or 60 days expire, whether that prompts sort of a strong US reaction.

Iran has built a Shaheed drone factory in  Russia, after giving them thousands of their own Shaheed drones or selling them, they now have a factory there producing it. That's what's hammering the Ukrainian cities every night. And the third thing is China has been backstopping the economy with increases in imports and exports, but equally importantly, providing the microelectronics that are used in Russian cruise and ballistic missiles.  So all three of these countries, this axis of authoritarians are supporting the fourth Russia in this fight. And that's who Ukraine's been going against.

It's essentially a threat to freeze Russia's lucrative oil exports, and it mirrors Senator Lindsey Graham's legislation that is gaining some momentum on Capitol Hill. Senator Graham touted his bill as another tool available to President Trump to pressure Putin to come to the negotiating table.  This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariff on any country that helps Russia and props up Putin's war machine. He can dial it up or down. He can go to zero to 500. He has maximum flexibility. But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.  All together, this is a significant turn in President Trump's posture toward Ukraine, as he deals with the practical reality that Putin remains a significant impediment to a long-sought peace deal to end the war. Joining me now is our team of superb reporters, NBC News Senior White House Correspondent Garrett Haake,  NBC News Senior National Security Correspondent Courtney Kube and our double chief, Chief Washington and Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell joins me on set. Great to have you here. Let me begin with you, Garrett, if I may. What more did we hear from the president about how he views this different kind of deal regarding weapons for Ukraine?  Well, I think the president here is trying to sort of split the middle here and provide weapons to Ukraine without providing weapons to Ukraine. He had a campaign promise to end this war on day one that obviously went out the window some time ago. But another one that said the U.S. would no longer be funding Ukraine's defense."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 241.133, "text": "Now he's able to allow for Ukraine's defense.  without funding it directly."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 244.979, "text": "And this includes those Patriot missile air defense systems that have been number one on President Zelensky's wish list, if you will, which will be coming from other countries. This is the other kind of benefit for President Trump, who has long talked about the idea that Europe needs to do more for its own defense. Here he gets to say that it's Europe providing these weapons, other NATO countries buying them from the US, and he can tout the superiority of American military hardware, another favorite talking point. From the White House's perspective, this is all a win-win.  And it was notable today, Garrett, that the president talked about the importance of a strong Europe, something we don't always hear from him. And part of that is some of Europe has had its own relationships with Russia over the years. What more do we know about how this could affect energy prices? Certainly, China is a big consumer of that.  Yeah, take a look at Mark Rutte's hand, the NATO Secretary General here, who's been kind of a guide for Donald Trump in dealing with Europe and dealing with NATO. I think you could probably argue pretty successfully to get to this point. The nature of these tariffs as secondary tariffs, not on Russia, a country with which we do little business of any kind right now, but on the other countries that buy their oil and gas, is significant. It's the kind of thing that could potentially raise prices in those countries on these  products and could raise global prices given the global nature of the energy economy here. So if you're China or Iran or another major importer of Russian oil, it might also increase your willingness to lean on Russia to end this war. This is just not the kind of thing that's good for the economies of any of the places in the graphics on your screen, potentially including the United States, which could see prices rise as well, again, given the global nature of the oil markets.  So it ratchets up the pressure, if you will, on Vladimir Putin in a variety of ways to make a deal of some kind and soon.  Thank you so much, Garrett. Let me turn now to our colleague Courtney, and obviously you can give us the picture of what does this announcement mean for the real fighting that's taking place on the ground. So it's symbolic in that the fact that President Trump is providing these weapons to Ukraine, but the reality is there are very few number of actual weapons or systems. They're going to be a game changer on the ground in Ukraine, and patriots are definitely not them.  But they will have the ability once, if in fact there are going to be multiple Patriot batteries brought into Ukraine that will defend against what we have seen are a barrage of Russian attacks in recent weeks. We're talking hundreds of missiles and drones being fired in just a day or just one night, Kelly. These Patriots will have the ability to defend against those, to save Ukrainian civilian lives. And that in and of itself should be enough to help bolster some of the Ukrainian momentum  hopefully, including on the battlefield, is the goal here by NATO to help bolster the fighting there. But the reality is, on a day-to-day basis, it continues to be a war of inches in Ukraine. And defensive systems like this are not likely to be able to push Russian military back in any real way.  and that cadence from Russia has been just alarmingly increased. When you consider the NATO piece of this, do you have any sense of how that will work? Is NATO ready to embrace this fully? NATO absolutely has been embracing this already. And one way that they may look at this weapons, this change, and how the U.S. is going to provide weapons and systems to Ukraine is a U.S. military component there called SAG-U.  It stands for Special, I forgot what the A stands for, Group Ukraine Assistance. That's the A, Special Assistance Group Ukraine. It's a military component that's based in Wiesbaden, Germany, and that's where the U.S. coordinates all of the assistance that they are providing to Ukraine.  NATO already works closely with SAG-U. Kelly, I could see a scenario where they only increase their coordination and cooperation, maybe even NATO taking a leadership role with SAG-U, and that they would be the ones to essentially distribute or coordinate systems moving into Ukraine going forward.  You are always fluent in acronyms, Courtney, I have no doubt. Thank you so much. Let me turn to Andrea. Andrea, so good to have you here with us.

The president tells his base to cool it amid a revolt against the Justice Department leadership for failing to deliver on conspiracy theories they once amplified, tied to Jeffrey Epstein.

President Trump's threat of new tariffs on Russia's biggest trading partners comes as he announces new tariffs on the nations the U.S. relies on for major trading relations, including a 30 percent tariff on most imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1st, unless they make a deal. That weekend announcement coming just days after the president threatened 35 percent tariffs on certain Canadian goods, also effective August 1st.  In reaction, the EU is pausing its proposed retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. until August 1st as it looks to continue negotiations toward a trade deal. But at least some EU officials appear skeptical the president will actually make good on these latest threats."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "EU", "Unfair"], "line": 34, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1211.909, "text": " Could I just add that until now, our American friends have achieved one deal and 23 threats. So it makes a lot of sense that those of us who are threatened compare notes, as the commissioner said. And I think we shouldn't underestimate our power."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 35, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1229.611, "text": " They're keeping track. NBC News Senior Business Correspondent Christine Romans joins me now. Anne, help us to put this into everyday terms. When you hear 30 percent tariffs on EU and Mexican imports, what could that look like for American consumers?  I mean, it's a huge new cost in the supply chain for medicines, for pharmaceuticals, for important, you know, highly skilled manufacturing equipment that comes to the United States. You know, French wine and Spanish olive oil and Italian cheese. I mean, just think of all of the different things. This trading relationship is 30 percent of the entire globe's trade is those 27 nations in that block and the United States.  huge. So the worry is it could cause some companies, some industries to have, you know, huge new costs and company and factory closures. It could mean new costs for American consumers. And if there's that retaliation that you talked about that's now on the table, but that retaliation, if it happened, it would really hurt American farmers and brewers and Kentucky bourbon makers and a whole bunch of really important industries that export to the EU.  more of that uncertainty that you've been talking about and helping us understand for months. So when you look at the fact that the EU has, at least for now, delayed its retaliatory tariffs, what is more likely at this point, do you think? Is the EU willing to negotiate or are they expecting President Trump to simply back down?  I mean, they have to keep negotiating. And what we're hearing is that they are indeed still talking. But when you listen to the people close to the president, Kevin Hassett, who is one of his top advisers, saying that they've been working on these deals, but the president is the one in the end,  who can decide what he wants for the American people and who wants more from what some of these countries have been offering. In terms of the EU, it's an incredibly difficult, difficult negotiating bloc. You have the self-interest of 27 different countries, and then you have the trading interests of the bloc itself. So, I mean, it must be very, very interesting to try to be the person or the team negotiating with the U.S. on behalf of 27 different countries.  I suppose it's good they're still talking. One other way we look at this is how seriously are markets taking the latest iteration, the president's threats now? Anything you're seeing there? Taking it in stride, and this is something that we're told is actually bullying the president. The president can see that the markets have not reacted dramatically.  That said, it was the worst first six months for the dollar, I think, in 50 years. So in dollar markets and in bond markets, we have seen sort of the strain. You got Bitcoin at record highs. That's an alternate sort of store of value. So that could very well be all of this controversy and drama has pushed people into Bitcoin, although this administration and this president and his family have been very bullish about Bitcoin and actually in that business. So that could be part of it there. But the Nasdaq at a record high today. So you have  some people who are kind of cautiously looking at this snapback in markets from April, when the president made his first, you know, threats and then paused them, and who are saying maybe the market could be ahead of itself if the president really does come through with these very, very strong and steep tariffs.  Christine, thank you so much. Really appreciate that. I want to turn now to some news that has just been developing, and this comes out of the Supreme Court. We just learned that the high court is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its staffing cuts at the Department of Education. In May, a federal judge blocked the administration from making those drastic cuts to the workforce.  And now in a six to three, so that's the conservative to the liberal bloc ruling along those ideological lines, the court says they can go forward. The White House is looking to lay off more than 1,000 people as part of its effort to dismantle the Department of Education.  And up next, former President Biden speaks out, calling President Trump and other Republicans, quote, liars amid GOP investigations into his clemency decisions and his mental fitness while Mr. Biden was in office. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  Welcome back. President Trump is facing a brewing revolt from his MAGA base after his Justice Department shot down conspiracy theories tied to convicted sex offender, the late Jeffrey Epstein. Conspiracy theories, which the president and multiple top DOJ officials had previously amplified. In a recent memo, the Justice Department said it won't release any more evidence in the Epstein case and reaffirmed that Epstein was not murdered,  died by suicide, and that he did not maintain a client list. Now, that has prompted fury from Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, who has threatened to quit over Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of this matter, and that is according to a source who has spoken with Bongino. Bongino's anger at Bondi and skepticism of the DOJ's conclusions is being echoed by the president's loyal base.

President Trump is tamping down on any rift and standing by his attorney general, Pam Bondi, appearing with her this weekend and defending her as, quote, fantastic on social media. Joining me now is NBC News senior national politics reporter Matt Dixon, who's been covering this story for us. And, Matt, glad you are here to help us kind of put this all in perspective. When you look at this firestorm in MAGA World, is this really a creation of the president's own making?  But to some degree, I was at that conference in Tampa that you just played some clips from."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1640.099, "text": "And there really is sort of a Frankenstein's monster element to all of this sort of the scandal or the controversy that's been created really over a few years in the sense that the Trump campaign had promised its base transparency on the issue. They had talked about releasing the files, the Epstein files to the extent there are in client lists. And now they're in this moment where they're trying to walk that all back.  But they've created this sort of intensity with their base, and the MAGA movement that Trump created really wants answers on this. And the idea that the carpet has been pulled out from underneath them so abruptly really isn't sitting well with them. Trump has traditionally been very Teflon with his base, where he can have missteps, he can have things they might slightly disagree with, but they always come home. But I can tell you, in the convention center in Tampa this weekend,  It felt different. It felt like this is going to be a little more difficult. And to your point, part of that is, you know, because Trump himself promised so much on this issue and now appears to be walking it back."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 39, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1700.041, "text": "There was definitely a bubbling energy there where you were.

It feels like Bongino could be on the outs. And there was initial reporting that if he left, Patel would leave as well. And there was sort of a rift between those two and Attorney General Pam Bondi. Director Patel has since put out a tweet publicly saying that he is not leaving, he's going to stay with the administration. I think, again, that's sort of  the effort to try to move beyond this moment, even if that might be a little more difficult for the White House. So Bongino is a podcaster, had a large media following, and he is among the people who helped amplify the Epstein stuff. So I think there is some sense he wants to preserve here and wants to make sure that he still has credibility with Trump supporters in the MAGA base when and if he leaves the administration."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 41, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1765.038, "text": " So that credibility question leads me to my next thought. It's not the first time we've seen the president sort of annoy his base. That happened when he engaged in the bombings on Iran, those who didn't want him to be involved in foreign wars. Does this anger over the Epstein files feel different in some way? Does it have more staying power?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 42, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1783.465, "text": " It feels like it. It's always hard to tell because you don't want to sort of be captured by the moment necessarily where there's the most intense reaction and then it goes away. But being in that room in Tampa I've covered a lot of Trump events. I've covered a lot of conservative conventions. It certainly felt different. And again because Trump built  some credibility with his base on this issue is a main talking point for a very long time. So to the degree that you can put the toothpaste sort of back in the MAGA tube feels like it might be a little more difficult this time, because one, the allegations are terrible that the Epstein, and two, excuse me,  The idea that, you know, messing with children and doing things like this has become a main tenet of sort of Trump's messaging, of MAGA's messaging. So this hits home. This is sort of guttural for a lot of his supporters. So it does feel a little different than, say, a policy fight or an issue over foreign policy.

Option two is they're engaging in a cover-up. So is conspiracy something that Democrats really want to wade into? They often use that as a political weapon against Republicans and certainly MAGA conservatives. Is this a place where Democrats want to be?  You saw two things today. One thing you saw Mark Vesey, who has one of these districts in Texas that the Republicans are wanting to redistrict in a special session, who came to the floor and said, yes, let's make all of this public. Let's jump. And that's a Democrat running right into the middle of this saying, yes, let's just open this up so everybody can see everything, which is a good political move for him. But the second thing is we're moving into  off your election cycles. And you've covered this, and it's all about for everybody at home, off your elections. It's not elections where everybody votes.

And after the break, we're on the ground in Texas, where heavy rainfall and more flooding is threatening recovery efforts as the search for the missing enters its second week. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  We're glad you're back. More rain is hampering recovery efforts in central Texas. The Kerr County Sheriff's Office is ordering all volunteers to leave the river area and move to higher ground because of more threatening weather. That's after as much as 10 inches fell over the weekend, halting efforts to find the more than 100  60 people still unaccounted for after the July 4th flooding. And this all comes as the Trump administration is defending the federal response to the catastrophic floods following the president's visit to the area on Friday. Now, on Meet the Press yesterday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem denied reports that thousands of calls from flood victims to FEMA call centers went unanswered. She also acknowledged and defended a new policy that requires her direct sign-off  on contracts or grants that spend more than $100,000. And that has raised concerns about the pace of aid distribution."}, {"keywords": ["Export"], "line": 64, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2377.364, "text": " It's not extra red tape, it's making sure everything is getting to my level and that it's immediately responded to.

My colleague, NBC News correspondent Ryan Chandler joins me. And Ryan, what is the latest that you are hearing on the search for those from the July 4th flooding? You're on the ground. What are you hearing?  Well, it's more difficult news, Kelly. This is the last thing that Texas needed. This entire central Texas region battered by rain through yesterday and into today, which is stalling the search and rescue efforts here and causing the need for a lot more rescues in other parts. We just heard from Governor Abbott, who increased the total death count for the state. We now know statewide 131 people have died due to flooding, including  of course, most of the deaths here in Kerr County. In Travis County, where Austin is, nine people are dead and three are missing. So that speaks to the urgent need to try and find as many people as possible. We have seen the helicopters, the ground teams working again today after taking most of yesterday off. Kerr County gave the all clear to them to resume their efforts yesterday afternoon. But with more rain, it's been hard to get things in the air and people in the water  This is dangerous work as it is, and this weather is not making it any easier, Kelly. And exhausting and emotionally wrenching certainly work as well. Are you getting a sense that some of the additional changes in the forecast are having really practical impediments for what they're trying to accomplish?  Yeah, absolutely. I'll tell you, we were out with the dive teams a couple days ago watching how they do their work. And they said they're literally trying to look for bodies in muddy water that is far deeper than they are used to. And the problem is with the forecast, even if it's not raining on top of us right now, if it's raining upriver, that's going to come down in the hours ahead. So they are preemptively making sure that they're not in the water as it  rises. We were at the base camp for thousands of volunteers yesterday and it was empty. We saw it a couple days ago. There were people cooking food for first responders, donating trucks and equipment. It was buzzing. It was a little depressing to see it empty because as much as these people want to help, they just couldn't yesterday, Kelly.  You heard we played a clip of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem talking about the administration's response. Certainly the White House and she have been saying it has been an exemplary response. Are you hearing any questions on the ground? What is it that in the community where people are really personally affected by this, are they seeing the speed of the government response as she describes it? Or do they have a different perspective based on the conversations you've had?  I'll tell you, we have seen FEMA workers on the ground collaborating with local, state, and federal resources today. We've seen the FEMA office that has stood up to help anybody who needs to come to them for disaster assistance if maybe their home has been damaged.  To be honest, I've noticed a bit of a disconnect between the ground truth here and the narrative that FEMA has been ineffective. I've been talking to first responders, search and rescue teams, asking them if they are happy with FEMA's resources, and a lot of them tell me,  What are you talking about? We haven't noticed anything different. We have everything that we need, whether that is from FEMA or from neighbors coming out with a chainsaw offering to help. It has been an outpouring of support. I have not heard from anybody who says we don't have enough to do our jobs here.  That's very helpful to gather that kind of on-the-ground perspective. Ryan, thank you so much. Stay safe there. Stay cool if you can. And still to come, there are conflicting reports on the conditions of detainees at a controversial new immigration center that's been called Alligator Alcatraz. We will have reactions from the Democratic and Republican lawmakers who had a tour of that facility this weekend. You're watching Meet the Press Now.  We're glad you're back with us, and we are following a number of developments in connection with the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, including a court ruling limiting who ICE agents can arrest in Los Angeles. A federal judge issued that temporary restraining order on Friday, ruling that federal agents have been arresting people based upon their race or their spoken language. The Justice Department says it is appealing the decision.  Also, we're watching that lawmakers are providing drastically different accounts of the conditions inside Florida's new immigration detention facility that's been called Alligator Alcatraz. After a tour of the facility this weekend, Democrats described it as dirty, crowded, and unsanitary, while Republicans describe it as well-run and no squalor.  It comes as NBC News has exclusive new reporting on the conditions inside other detention centers. Immigration advocates tell NBC News that immigrants being held in ICE detention centers in at least seven states are complaining of hunger, food shortages, and spoiled food. A DHS spokesperson said in a statement, quote, any claim that there is a lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.  NBC News Chief Capitol Hill Correspondent Ryan Nobles joins me now. And Ryan, when we talk about a tour of members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, how did that come about? Who are we talking about?  Well, this is a group of Florida, members of the Florida delegation, both Republicans and Democrats, but it was really Democrats that pushed to get access to what's being dubbed Alligator Alcatraz. This was after they were initially denied access to this facility. They ended up getting a tour. They said that it was a limited tour of the facility and what they described were inhumane conditions. They say that the people that are detained in this facility are  packed into cages, as they describe them, as many as 32 people per one of these cells that divide the detainees that are being brought in. They say that it is hot, it is uncomfortable, and it is not the way a federal immigration detention facility should be run.  Obviously, the administration feels very differently about this. They think that this is an appropriate use of taxpayer funds and an appropriate way to run this process as they carry out their mass deportation plans. But obviously, this is a controversy that is just beginning, and Democrats are going to try and highlight it as much as they possibly can going forward.  And their visit, Ryan, seems like it would be instructive because the Homeland Security Secretary said to Kristen Welker, our colleague over the weekend on Meet the Press, that the administration wants to build facilities similar to Alligator Alcatraz in other places. So might this be a fight that plays out from Capitol Hill this fall and in other states?  I mean  full of funding to help support the Trump mass deportation effort. So there's every reason to believe that if the administration wants to create more facilities like this, they're going to have the ability to do it. And there isn't much that Congress can do to stop it. And that there's even much of a will for members of Congress to stop it.  I think it really much more becomes a campaign issue, Kelly, as we head into the 2026 midterms. Democrats are going to point to this as being an example of how the Trump administration has run just roughshod over this immigration policy and that their mass deportation plan goes too far.  When you talk about campaigns, I want to bring up a new Gallup poll that shows that Americans' views on immigration are more favorable now than they were a year ago. A record 79% say immigration is a good thing for the country. That's up 15 points from a year ago. Just 30% say immigration should be decreased compared to 55% a year ago. So should this be a red flag for Republicans that views might be changing?  I mean, if it is, they're showing no signs in that direction, Kelly. Republicans have long believed that immigration is what they call an 80-20 issue for them. They believe that there's nuance in these numbers. And when presented with the way they're going about enforcing immigration, that that likely will be favorable to voters in the upcoming midterms. And we'll end it right there. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate it. We're back tomorrow with more Meet the Press Now. But the news continues with Hallie Jackson right now.

Anyway, Trump made it absolutely clear that he wants the war to stop and that he inherited Joe Biden's war. Trump believes, and I'm sure he's right, that Putin just waited for Biden to come into office and then he invaded Ukraine.  Certainly Biden's decision to flee from Afghanistan had a lot to do with Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. And we can all remember how pathetic Biden's response was as hundreds of thousands of Russian troops amassed on the eastern border of Ukraine when Biden then said, and I'm going to quote, don't end quote, don't.  which, as one wag put it, is what you say to your dog who's pulling a sock away. Don't didn't stop Putin, and nothing else Biden did stop Putin. And Biden's appeasement with Iran didn't stop Putin, nor his appeasement with China.  Trump is really the first president since Ronald Reagan with an effort to check Russia and its grandiose empire ambitions. Mr. Trump also announced a 100% secondary tariff on Russia, but not for 50 days. Personally, I think it should be a much shorter period.  Also impressive was NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, a former conservative prime minister of the Netherlands and a Trump friend and ally. But even more than that, the NATO countries agreed with President Trump to seek defense spending of 5% of GDP, which will send a strong, tough message to Vladimir Putin's phony ambitions. More than any time I can remember, the US is now working in tandem with Europe.  Now there will always be differences, of course. But interestingly, in response to a question on tariffs, Mr. Trump reiterated his 30% EU tariff proposal, but clearly suggested that it was a work in progress and trade negotiations are continuing. By the by, both the stock market and the dollar rallied over the course of the Trump-Ruta press conference.  More than anything, Mr. Trump wants peace, not war. He tried to negotiate with Putin, but it didn't work out. He has inherited a war that would never have happened if Joe Biden were any kind of a strong president. But Biden was a weakling, an appeaser. And Trump has to pick up the pieces and end this Russian problem.  If the United States and the NATO countries of Europe do act in concert, new weapons and all, it will mark the first major show of strength against the dictator Vladimir Putin.

He should have had security that was commensurate with a sitting U.S. president because of the unique nature of who he was, who he is, and the threat at that time. So what needs to happen moving forward is the leadership, of course, did change. Cheadle's gone. Roe's gone. And that's very important because it starts at the top.  And you need to embrace technology. You need to change the training. There's cultural changes that need to be made. And they're starting to be made by Director Curran. And that's a very positive thing. But in embracing technology, if you remember, two weeks after the attempt in Butler, there was another attempt in Florida. And that fellow was laying in wait. That assassin was laying in wait for 12 hours. That should have never happened if you had infrared technology, drones, robodogs, and even old-fashioned good old sniffing German shepherds.  They would have literally sniffed him out within 20 or 30 minutes, not waiting for 12 hours.

And that was that no longer is the American taxpayer going to foot the bill for traditional security and defense of Europe.  You know, for 76 years, American presidents have been talking about that. Donald Trump delivered it last month. And now the next step is to make Europe pay for the defense and the support of Ukraine, which Joe Biden and, you know, some members of Congress decided that the U.S. taxpayer and the hardworking Americans should be paying for that.  Obviously, America makes the best weapons, and everyone wants them. And Ukraine, to defend themselves, President Trump's been clear, they should get access to U.S. weapons. And so Europe has come through the NATO structure and said, we'll put up the money, we'll buy these American weapons, and we'll send them to Ukraine to defend themselves.  Now, there is already a lot of support for Ukraine happening, and weapons are constantly moving, and that's anything from Patriot missiles, which you mentioned, to things like just ammunition and other types of armaments. But this idea that President Trump has put together and brokered, I think really is a big win for Ukraine.  Ukraine to defend itself, but it's also a big win for the American taxpayer.

Yesterday, July 13th, marked one year since the tragedy that struck my hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman nearly assassinated President Trump. Tragically, he took the life of Corey Competore and seriously wounded David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Yesterday, I returned to the Butler Farm Showgrounds  where I was with the President a year ago. I met with the Comptatore family during a celebration of Corey's life. They are incredibly strong, and I know all of us on stage continue to send our thoughts and prayers to them as we seek more answers about what actually happened that day. Now, we're here today to highlight  new resolution H.R. 571, which formally recognized the events of 2014 and July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania. The resolution also condemns the rise in political violence we have seen across our nation over the last year.  from the assassination attempts against President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, and West Palm Beach, Florida, to the attacks against Governor Josh Shapiro in April, and to the deadly attacks on the Minnesota state lawmakers just last month. Let's be clear. We must stand up together to oppose violence against our nation's leaders all across each party. And I want to thank my co-lead on the resolution  RSC Chairman August Lugar from Texas. When we talk about this, though, we can have as many resolutions as we want to bring it forward. And I've heard person after person, politician after politician, get up and say, I am absolutely appalled by the violence that's taking place in this country today. And we've got to stop using that type of language. And with 24 hours, they're out talking again about who should not be sitting in certain offices.  So it's one thing to have a resolution. It's one thing to be resolved the fact we're not going to keep talking like this. What I'm asking all our Congress, everybody that's in the Congress, everybody that's in elected office, please watch what you say. Don't start off saying we should never do this and then within 24 hours go out and make statements again that incite people. That's a false lead. It's a false premise. Our resolution is an attempt to get people to speak  the way they should speak. In America, the way we settle things is by votes. So it's my pleasure to be with all these people behind me today because they're all feeling the same way. And, uh, I'm going to introduce Dan Muser now. Dan and I sat beside each other in Butler July 13th last year and watched as the assassination attempt took place. I got to tell you at first,  Nobody knew what was happening. It sounded like somebody was shooting off firecrackers. And then, when we saw the president go down, we knew exactly what happened. We did not know that Cory Compitore had been seriously wounded and was going to die. We did not know the two other gentlemen were seriously wounded and are still recovering from those wounds. But today, we are making an effort to make sure that we start speaking the right way in America. Mr. Muser.

And I said, Mr. President, I advise against it. I was not supportive. I was more concerned about his safety.  But his level of courage is, well, boundless. When the president was hit on July 13th, we all couldn't help but really think the worst. But that certainly changed, as we all saw. At the moment, he lifted up security agents on his back.  put his fist up, said, fight, fight, fight, wiping blood from his face. And in so doing, he lifted everybody in that arena up, at the rally up. They began the chant of USA, USA. And I think he rose the entire nation up. And I think we saw that on the following November 5th.  Uh, but the rhetoric, rhetoric and politics is, is out of control, right? I recently met with, uh, members of the indivisible group and up in my district insisting I show up, insisting I show up. Well, we had an hour meeting. I let it go to an hour and 40 minutes, but right at the very end, they said, uh, one of them said, you know, you're, you're, you're a Nazi. And so, so it was president Trump. Okay. Nazi. All right. We know what the Nazis did when people were out there making such comments and elected officials.  You know, some people believe them. They actually think that you might be that, and that hate-speak turns into violence. Just this weekend, Vice President J.D. Vance and his family were at Disney World, cursed at, all kinds of foul language thrown at them, and Governor Newsom has to put something out saying, did you enjoy your time at Disney World, okay?  Governor Newsom is sick to do something like that and to act that way. And how about the ICE agents being demonized and attacked for doing their jobs? And elected officials are out there cheering it on. So there are too many Democrats, frankly, that are tolerating this, in fact, encouraging it. Not all, not all by any means. My friends that are Democrats condemn it as well. But there's too many falsehoods. And we've got a governor in Pennsylvania that does nothing but skew falsehoods.  And again, people believe him, how certain measures are being taken that we're taking food out of hungry Pennsylvanians' mouths. Nothing could be further from the truth. And Brooke Rollins came up to Pennsylvania and pointed out the truth. So we have this resolution. It's about hate speech.  uh, cause hate speech leads to violence. It's dangerous. Uh, we also are seeing a high level of a surge in antisemitic rhetoric. I mean, for crying out loud, I put out a post recently on Facebook, uh, something positive about Israel. I literally got hundreds of, of, of, uh, basically threats and, and all kinds of other, uh, hate, uh, messages. So look, we, um, we're not going to stop at all, but this resolution is about,  calling for an end to hateful rhetoric. Uh, it is about a resolution that somberly, somberly making, uh, answering or, or a, uh, recognizing the one year anniversary of the attack on president Donald J. Trump at honors Corey Compertor, who died shielding his family and David Dutch and James Compa Haver who are, who are injured. And it also brings out, uh, the governor I just mentioned, uh, Josh Shapiro and some others,  that had, we had our governor residents attacked, okay?

It was an attack on our president, on the families that were gathered there to hear him speak, and on the institutions that hold our democracy together.  As a member of the bipartisan task force on the assassination attempt, I joined my colleagues to ask the hard questions. How did this happen? And what can we do to make sure that it never happens again?  Our final report laid out clear recommendations, and since then, Congress has acted, improving threat detection systems, strengthening agency coordination, and expanding protections for officials. The Secret Service has also responded by updating its threat modeling and improving interagency protocols. But important questions remain, and so does our responsibility.  I want to thank Chairman Kelly and Chairman Pfluger for introducing the resolution. It rightly honors the bravery of those who responded. It remembers Corey Comparatore, who gave his life to protect his family, and uplifts the heroism that saved others.  But this resolution is more than a remembrance. It is a call to action. Threats and attacks, whether against the president, a judge, a member of Congress, or ICE agents, are unacceptable.

That the people who have been ravaged by globalism and mass migration and fentanyl will have a champion in Washington. And meanwhile, leftists on the other side of the aisle were slandering that same then presidential candidate.  saying that he is a threat to democracy, that he's a wannabe dictator, that he is literally Hitler in their words.

Political violence has absolutely no place in this country, but unfortunately, this kind of rhetoric has continued. We hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle demonizing the brave men and women who serve in ICE and in immigration facilities, saying that what they are doing is similar to the secret police, that they are being compared to the Gestapo.

This is a very serious situation, and it happens in many ways. It happens in the headlines. It happens in news clips. It happens in social media posts. It happens in campaign literature and e-mails. And it happens in rhetoric going across the aisle between Republicans and Democrats.  There is no place for political violence. And the people that suffer the most are people like Corey Compertor and his family. It's also a major strain on our Capitol Police. And if you talk to Capitol Police, I encourage you press to talk to them.  They are dealing with a massive amount of death threats for members of Congress, and they have limited resources. We would love to see their resources used here at the Capitol for visitors and safety for everyone.  However, they are constantly having to investigate death threats that come from me and other members of Congress. Over the break, I spent time talking with the FBI about someone that delivered a syringe in my mailbox and talked with them about other cases. And there's been multiple people convicted for pleading guilty to planning to kill me.  But this goes across the aisle on both ways, and I think I'm really grateful to be standing here with my colleagues that are saying enough of this.

You know, the culture of lawlessness and violence, this didn't just start last year.  Y'all, this started under the Obama administration when they decided to illegally investigate conservative groups, when they were out there demonizing Republicans who just simply wanted to follow the Constitution and make our country better. Then you fast forward to the Biden administration, who they put this on steroids and actually allowed the public to take part in this game.  Example, Summer of Love, where rioters were out there burning police stations, assaulting officers, taking over our cities, where they were advocating to defund the men and women in blue who protect us. And they didn't just encourage it, y'all, they promoted it. Hey, they even paid for their bail. The other thing I want to make a point is, and I think Representative Green hit the nail on the head, y'all, we got a morality problem in this country.  There's no value to the sanctity of life anymore. Socialists, woke politicians, they want to have people to look to the government for every answer they need. That's not what we, we, we don't look to the government. We're supposed to look towards God for our, for our answers. What happened in Butler?

And he said, you know, hey, Maxie, how's it going? I said, going well, Mr. President. She said, can I help you? I said, no. I said, thank you. Thank you for fighting and thank you for being here. Because on that day, that could have altered the trajectory of this entire country of where we are. President Trump is our 47th president. If that gentleman would have been successful, I don't know where we would have been today.  And honestly, I don't care because he's still standing and he is our president. And when you talk about political violence throughout this country and rhetoric and what it ensues, I know all of my colleagues have experienced it. I myself, just a few weeks ago, got ran off the road.  because some individual wanted to get my attention and he couldn't and he decided to use his vehicle as a weapon. This legislation should be bipartisan in its nature and it should be pushed through without question. And enough is enough. You have an issue with your city councilman, your mayor, your legislator, your governor, your Senator, call them and set up a meeting. And if they're not, hold them accountable because I can tell you that we answer phone calls and emails and messages from our office.  every single day that we are here and not here, because that is our job as a representative for each and every single one of our districts. But what should not be forgotten is what could have happened on that day and where we would have been. And thank God President Trump is here. Thank God he is addressing political violence. But I'm sick of it. I myself have experienced it. My family has now been put, you know, right in harm's way. And enough is enough. And it's not just on members of Congress.  It's also on our constituents with the quorum and just to behave with respect. Yes, you know, we do set an example for the American people to see, but it's not just on us to carry out that example. It's for everyone within our districts who is a loving father, mother, brother, sister, grandmother, grandfather, you name it, cousin, uncle. It is on all of us as a community to come together and just put your weapons down and say enough is enough and just politely disagree over political rhetoric. Because I can tell you one thing,  It wasn't worth it for that gentleman who tried to take out President Trump, and it wasn't worth it for that gentleman who tried to run me off the road. Consequences have actions, and you will see swift action being taken against anybody who harms any publicly elected official or any constituent. So thank you very much. It's my honor to introduce a great Texan, Roger Williams.  One year ago, as we've talked about, a violent and deranged terrorist set out to change the course of American history by attempting to assassinate President Trump. God spared his life for a reason. Moments after bullets intended to kill him miraculously grazed his ear, President Trump stood and commanded the American people to fight, fight, fight. A renewed spirit of American strength and determination was unleashed that day. Now more than ever, we must work to uphold the values that this country is built on as we usher in the golden age  of national security, economic prosperity, transparency, and peace through strength. President Trump has put everything on the line. He's put his name, his freedom, his legacy, because he believes in America. He works tirelessly every single day to put the American people first. Let me be clear. Political violence, as we've talked about, has no place in our country. Evil will not prevail. We are one nation under God. And let us honor the victims that faithful day by restoring American legacy that future generations are proud of.  Now, in my lifetime, there's three things that come to mind as I stood up here. I was one of the last people to shake the hands of John Kennedy on November 22nd, 1963, as a 15-year-old. I shook his hand at 1046 in the morning. At 1246, he was assassinated. I remember that like it was yesterday. Rhetoric. Rhetoric brought that to be. I also remember the baseball shooting. Some of you may remember that. Many of us, our lives were changed that day because of rhetoric.  And I remember that day, everybody wanted to pray for us and offer thanks or offer their prayers. But it wasn't 24 hours later, and Mike, you touched on this, 24 hours later, we were back to where enemies were enemies. And I remember my daughters, two daughters, went to the mailbox several weeks, well, several months ago now, and opened up two letters, each one addressed to them, and had urine, blood, and feces in them.  in the envelopes, and it said, this will be on your father's tombstone. That's tough stuff. It's got to stop. Mike Kelly, Pfluger, and the rest of us believe now is the time to make that happen. So let's keep America great. Let's again pray for President Trump, pray for his safety, and all my colleagues' safety. In God we trust.  Thank you, Mike and August, for having this event today to just remind us all that, you know, despite what happened a year ago to President Trump, and I believe that the Lord spared President Trump's life in that field there in Butler, Pennsylvania. But in spite of that, he remained in the presidential race. He carried on because of his love for our country and the encouragement of the American people. Sadly, we have reached a point in political discourse in this country  where President Trump and every politician must have the courage to speak our political beliefs while knowing that at any point, our lives can be in danger. Just like we saw in Minnesota, just like Congressman Miller mentioned, I too had, uh, was met on an airplane, uh, met by the police because there was a deranged man who was a former San Francisco police officer that was in Fort Wayne, Indiana, looking for me. And I know that every one of us probably have a story similar to that. And I remember, um, Congressman Kelly back in 2010,  during the Tea Party election. Passions were high, but we didn't see the hate speech and the political violence that we see today. We have got to stop it on both sides. In fact, I know every one of us up here would always condemn anybody on our side of the aisle that was performing a political  And I believe that the left needs to do the same thing. That they need to condemn political violence. They need to condemn hate speech. Just as much as what we do.  Their side continues to behave differently. And heaven forbid that it happens from either side. But we continue to see it coming from the left side of the aisle. But I tell you what, as Americans, we have a great opportunity. As we elect our leaders, we need to continue to make sure that we as leaders are responsible in our rhetoric.  But I just appreciate President Trump standing up, even though he was almost killed that day, that he continued to fight, fight, fight for Americans, and standing for not only our democracy, but for our Constitution and our great republic. So Mike, thank you for leading this today, and I'll turn it back over to you. Thank you. So you've heard from us. I want to share something with you that has nothing to do with a political entity.  I was at the Celebration of Life with the Comptor family yesterday. Just for a moment, step out of whom you are and think about them. On the morning, Cory, his wife Helen, his two daughters were so excited to be able to travel a short distance to the Butler Farm Show  to see president Trump speak. This was Corey's idol. This is Helen's idol. This was the girl's idol. They just couldn't wait to get to Butler to see president Trump. The four of them get in their car. They make their way over. It's like 97 degrees that day. Okay. So it's not pleasant. It's a warm day. And what was even warmer was the crowd that was there to greet our president.  And what I want you to think about, especially of those of you who've lost somebody, a father, a mother, two daughters go to an event. It's not supposed to be event about anger. It's not about event to anything other than they're going to see their favorite president.  They actually were not sitting in the seats that they were assigned. There was an opening at the top that they went up to. Shots rang out. Corey Comptor's first reaction was to get his wife and his daughters down so he could be over the top of them. What they didn't realize was that Corey had already been shot.  That day is a day that lives in their memories. It's in their sleep. It's in their waking hours. This has nothing to do with politics. This has to do with life. And I think we've become too casual about what life is and what life isn't.  If every single life is precious, then we should not be having this discussion today. But I want you to think about that family leaving their home, a volunteer fireman who spent his whole life running to danger to save others, who took his wife and daughters to an event to see somebody who they really liked and they wanted to listen to. Four people in a car drive to the Butler Farm Showgrounds. That evening,  Helen and the two daughters go home. Corey's been killed. Helen has lost her husband. His daughters have lost their father. Forever etched in their memory is that moment, that single moment when those shots rang out.  So if you're asking yourself why these things happen, is it because maybe intentionally or unintentionally we stoke those fires? This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. This is an issue actually just about human being to human being. Do we respect life? Do we respect other people? And what is it that we're trying to accomplish? Isn't it amazing that we have to have a resolution in the Congress of the United States to condemn that type of action?  What happened to the Comptories is horrible. And when I was with Helen yesterday, for her, it's the same day over and over and over again. For Allison and Kaylee, it's the same thing for them over and over and over again. Look, the way we speak, the way we act, the way we insinuate things,  That'll continue. We can pass resolution after resolution. We can go to church on Sunday and abhor what's taking place and we leave that church and we go out and we practice what we just condemned in our churches. I would say that the illness has far deeper roots than we know. We're gonna pass this resolution. And we're gonna think that in some way, we were able to change the way people think and the way people act. I would just ask you all,  as you live your lives, think about it. Think about it. Some of these things are said casually. Some of these things are said to get a reaction. The members behind me, the people in our Congress, the people in our homes expect nothing less than for us to act respectful to each other and always honor life. So with that, I'm going to close. I don't know, uh,  He's not here. So we can take some questions. Okay. Uh, you know, Danny and I sat beside each other, by the way, there was another person who, and I think I told you about, uh, Mark Fogle's mother was with me and she just wanted to meet the president. And she, when she talked to the president, we were standing together and she said, Mr. President, please, please bring my son home. I miss my son. I'm staying alive so I can see him. The president told her, Ms. Fogle, I get elected. Your son will be home.  Mark Fogle is now home with his family. I would ask all of us to please let's honor life in every single way. So if there's a, if there's questions, please, and we're all open to listen to anything and you're all, if you all want to say anything, I want you to say stuff. I think they were all magnificent. What you said. It is about life. It is about life and much, much more strongly. This political talk has got to stop. Let's talk about the value of the pieces of legislation.  what, how we value it. If we don't like the legislation, you know, we can solve this with a vote, right? Is it their vote? Yes or a vote? No, it's not that complicated. I don't know why life has become so complicated. So please, anybody that wants to ask a question, please. Yes, ma'am."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1818.515, "text": " Yeah, I think probably all of the above, but I don't care how much funding we put into it."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1840.042, "text": "I don't care how much protection we have.  there's always going to be a danger.

And we really worked and strove to really bring down the rhetoric. And it all came to a crashing halt in 2018.  And I'll let you figure out why that happened.

I think Democrats and Republicans should join together and really try to talk about why, you know, tell the truth to people out there and get them to calm down and realize that we're working together.

So it isn't just something they heard about on...  TV or somebody talking, they were actually there for it. And so there's people that can't go back onto those grounds. There's people who have trouble sleeping. All these different things happen. So I don't know that there's enough money in the world to change some of the way people think. I wish it were that way.  we face something, we're going to have a resolution and we can pass resolution after resolution after resolution. I will let you be the judge of that when you talk among yourselves. How is your speech? Uh, and I think each American should ask that. And if you're truly thinking the way our country was formed and why it's why it was the way it is, uh, and then try to figure out what happened today. I have no idea why it's happened. Yes, sir. Yeah.  I usually don't comment on other members' remarks. I just know that right now, we're still doing work.  We're not the task force that was the task force, but we still were individuals who were still concerned about what happened on both sides of the aisle. I think it has to be careful when we start to say, what was this? They'd want to do this. They don't want to do that. We were told that there were certain things they couldn't talk about right now. Okay. Right now is a year ago.  So I would like to see other things come out. I'm, I gotta tell you, I have no idea what's going on with Mr. Ralph. I have no idea of how these other things happen. We haven't heard the federal agencies early on, uh, really had kind of locked us out of things. Local law enforcement and Butler was very forthcoming of what happened. Uh, so we're still waiting for some answers on some things that didn't happen. Um, but today is about the resolution. Uh, we could have another discussion about other things else that we think we, we fell far short of the questions we were asking.  Yes, sir. Okay. Are there any conversations at all about supplemental funding for extra or additional security in the districts given how many threats you all have talked about facing and even action and violence? I think there's always going to be conversations about that, but I know for myself and the rest of the members that are with it, I, uh, I don't know if there's enough money in the world  that can address the problems we have with morality today. So it's good to say, if we had just had a few more dollars that day, it wouldn't have happened. Really? Really? We keep talking about the problem as a lack of funding. My feeling is that we have a problem with a lack of respect for life, in general. And when people do these things, they're acting out on something that I, while I'm not in that business, I would say, there's something wrong with them.  But if we encourage it, and what we're talking about with this resolution has nothing to do with a lot of those things, but it does have to do with members of Congress coming together on a resolution condemning what's happening. So hopefully that will have an effect. And thank you all for being here. I think later on we can talk about other things because you have an interesting question. I think Ms. Lee would have answers too to what we didn't get that we thought we were going to get. So listen, thank you all for being here.

The president spoke from the Oval Office alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte during the NATO chief's visit to Washington.  Trump suggesting that he could impose 100% tariffs, but it was not clear right away what products would actually be targeted here. I do want to talk a little bit more about tariffs in general. So let's bring in Peter Navarro, the White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing. Thank you so much for taking the time to be here with us today.  Let's be really sure. All right. And first off, I do want to ask you about the situation here regarding President Trump's announcement, so to speak, earlier regarding what could happen if the war is not to end in 50 days. What impact could those tariffs actually have on Russia and their trading partners? But also, do we know what products would be included?"}, {"keywords": [], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 61.726, "text": " Well, let's talk about the impact broadly. In order for Russia to prosecute the war it's prosecuting at the intense level it is, it needs a tremendous amount of money. And right now it's getting a lot of that money from the sale of its oil and natural gas. And if you tariff that,  and you put on what's called secondary sanctions, which would penalize China, India, and other countries for buying Russian oil, that would have a tremendous impact on the Russian economy and on Russia's ability to wage war. So that's the underlying strategy here. And what we've seen in the past is that sanctions alone  are a very useful and important tool, and they are an effective tool. But when you combine the power of financial sanctions, which is to say to cut off, say, Russia's access to the financial system, if you combine that  with tariffs. It's a very potent weapon. The problem we've had with sanctions is that there's workarounds and runarounds that Russia has been able to do. So this is a complete package. The mission of President Trump, let's be clear, there are  millions of people that have died from this war. The loss of life in this war is unimaginable to the American mind. If you compare, for example, the roughly 60,000 soldiers we unfortunately lost in the Vietnam War, which was a multi-year war, it was many years, with  What's happened with Russia alone, it's at least a million soldiers and Ukraine probably another half million. I mean, it's just unbelievable bloodshed. It's just gotta stop. The president has tried to do everything so far he can to bring the parties to the table. This is the next step in his strategy. And he's giving Russia some time to think about  what to do and how to respond, not just putting the hammer down, but this is the way he negotiates. So as the boss likes to say, let's see what happens. But peace in Ukraine would be a tremendous boon, both to the world in terms of just the people dying, but also in terms of the economy and stability in the region."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 233.007, "text": " What about the European Union and, of course, Mexico?

I mean, Navarro's rule here is that every country cheats us in a different way, depending on how they're organized, their industrial policy. India, for example, is the Maharaja of tariffs, has the highest tariffs in the world, whereas Japan has very high non-tariff barriers to keep, for example, our automobiles out. If you look at Europe, Europe has  tariffs, for example, that are four times higher on our autos than theirs. As a result, our auto deficit with Europe is very, very significant. What's fair about that? But on top of that, they also have this thing called a value-added tax, and the way that's treated makes it effectively both an export subsidy  to their exports, but also an additional tariff. So the effective tariff, for example, on autos is 30% on American exports to Europe, whereas it's only 2.5% on German and French exports to us. So those are the kinds of things that's got to be settled in Europe, by the way. I mean, we've tried to play fair with Europe. We went to the World Trade Organization. We've won cases.  on things like pork and beef. And Europe just flat out refuses to abide by the results. So President Trump, we know that their deficit is, I think, the second highest behind China.  And it's stealing our jobs, it's stealing our factories, it's stealing our wealth and our assets. President Trump, if Europe doesn't settle with us in a good deal, then he is imposing unilaterally a good deal for them.  And what we have to be careful, and I would simply suggest to Europeans that the idea of retaliating against the United States when you're cheating the hell out of us, not a good idea. That's not fair. I think you guys over there in Europe have to go to the mountaintop, look at what you're doing to us, understand that it's not a level playing field, that we have a president who will not tolerate that.  and that we have to come to an accommodation which is fair to American workers and American business."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Tariffs"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 394.05, "text": "There's been a lot of criticism since President Trump did announce these tariffs.

We've collected almost 100 billion dollars so far in tariff revenues.  And what that allows us to do, for example, with the big beautiful bill, is to pay for that bill and pay for debt reduction. The Council of Economic Advisers, which is a quasi-independent body within the White House, just issued a study that showed that the tariffs that President Trump has put in has not led to any inflation  at all. And that's consistent with our experience from the first term. So you have to distinguish between what the panicans, as President Trump calls them in the media, want to say as attacks on Trump or attacks on his policies and what reality is and what we've learned about terrorists. OK, initially, the terrorists were put in place. Wall Street melted down. Well, guess what? Wall Street melted right back up when they realized the terrorists were good.  and we're bringing in investment. So forget about that problem there. As far as tariff uncertainty there's no uncertainty. President Trump is going to use tariffs to level the playing field raise revenues for the American people. And I think  The markets are realizing that and adjusting very well to that. So all is good in Trump land. All is good with the Trump trade deals. It's a long process.

He is giving Putin an ultimatum, agreeing to a deal within 50 days, and he's threatening 100% secondary tariffs on Russia if the Russian leader fails to comply.  The novel arrangement will see America selling billions of dollars' worth of advanced weapons, potentially to European countries, who will then supply them on to Ukraine, instead of America sending them directly to Ukraine, as it has so far in this war. Countries like Germany, Finland, the UK, Denmark would be among the NATO buyers supplying Ukraine. What weapons is not clear beyond Patriot missile air defence batteries?  Ukraine desperately needs better protection from Russian air attacks. They've ramped up massively recently, up by 50% in the last month alone. As these figures show here, almost 500 drones fired on the 9th of June, then peaking to more than 740 on one night last week. Compare that to a year ago when Ukraine was coping with 200 or 300 drones a night on average.  The number of drones and missiles launched by Russian forces in June this year was ten times the amount launched in June 2024, and it is exacting a punishing toll in terms of casualties. Last month saw the highest number of civilian casualties in any month since the war began from air attacks. More than 230 killed and more than 1,300 injured.

Um, the,  Again, maybe it could be related to that declining demand from Gen Z. But we also got news on the Trump tariffs. So President Trump declared a 30% tariff rate for Mexico and the EU. There wasn't anything specific  about alcohol, but these are key markets for drinks makers. So not only Constellation Brands is down, but we're also seeing Brown Foreman, Boston Beer, Molson Coors down. Constellation makes Modelo and Corona.

They're in the US. They joined the S&P 500 a couple months ago. And so that stock is higher today. We tend to see whenever there's Bitcoin reaching a new high, Coinbase does well. And then also just watching the space for this week because the White House is calling this crypto week. There's going to be  some bills that Congress is voting on this week that would clarify the structure of the crypto sector and regulations around it. So all around, it's like a very bullish day for crypto and Coinbase. The ticker there is coin. All fitting. You're also looking at Rocket Lab, right? Yes.  So Rocket Lab, ticker RKLB, is at a record high right now. It's up about 7%. Citi raised their price target on this stock. They said that the price target comes as they shift their valuation methodology to the company's revenue potential, which if that  Sounds a bit boring. There's also some actually space related news in here. This is a rocket satellite company. They said they expect revenue to grow roughly 2.6 billion driven by 20 neutron launches per year.

And so after the subprime mortgage crisis, there was broad agreement that the Federal Reserve Board and other agencies just didn't focus and have the attention on making sure that existing consumer law was being followed. So the CFPB is responsible for inspecting the largest financial institutions and taking them to court  when they break the law, of course, also administering all sorts of rules that keep the mortgage markets, the credit reporting companies, and so many others in line."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 346.542, "text": " How does the CFPB interact with all the other bank policy stakeholders?

Two things happened that day. One was the wind down of a bank called Silvergate Bank.  which was heavily involved in banking some of the major crypto trading platforms. There was a flight of deposits out of that bank after the crypto winter and the collapse of FTX. We had been tracking, I serve on the FDIC board, and we were tracking Silvergate Bank, and on that day they announced that they were not going to need to be put into receivership, they would be self-liquidating.  And simultaneously, on that same day, we had an announcement by Silicon Valley Bank, which was a little bit of a goofy press release they issued, saying they're experiencing some real losses on their securities portfolio and they're going to be looking for capital.  it raised a lot of red flags and suspicions about whether they were viable. And this is something that is just so fundamental about banking and deposit taking is that it really is based on a belief that your money is gonna be there. And the truth is, is with federal deposit insurance and federal reserve discount window lending,  It always is, except when you have a bank that is over 90% uninsured deposits. This is something that is really unusual and some would argue is not even really a bank when you are that dependent on very, very large depositors that you grew so quickly. And so then the run began."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 644.757, "text": " How much would you ascribe it to the high percentage of non-insured deposits versus the concentration? So in very specific industries. So you mentioned the crypto one, but also here are all of these startups. It has raised a ton of money in 2020 and 2021. A bunch of them apparently just put their money in a bank.  which is kind of weird to me, a non-insured. And then we had the stock market plunge in 2022, funding dried up. There was no, very little new VC fundraising. So new dry powder to be put into the bank, startups drawing down their own deposits just to make payroll or whatever else. And so you have two things going on. One is the high level of uninsured deposits, but also the concentration so that there was this one specific sector that was all going through the cycle at the same time."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 694.842, "text": " So let me just push on that because even though it is one sector, and I agree with you, the concentration was an important factor in this, but let's remember that the individual firms that were funded by venture capital, many of them were doing fine. There was not necessarily something specifically or systemically wrong with those businesses.  But I think, and I agree with every small and mid-sized business out there, if I am launching a startup, whether it is an AI company or a dry cleaner,  It doesn't rank in the top 20 reasons of my business failing that my bank is gonna fail. And so what you start hearing is that these businesses, which are highly networked, as well as much faster communication, you get the advice from your funders and others that you need to run.

Their company was. And I could hear the panic in their voice as they tried to digest the news of what was happening.

So at the end of the day, though, the regulators, we saw an active run that was occurring. And of course, those insured depositors, the insured depositors really through the entire crisis did not really run. It was those uninsured. It started at Silicon Valley Bank.  After that Wednesday release, by Friday morning, they were dead. We had actually voted the night before, or maybe at the pre-dawn hours, to accept it into receivership, and I believe by the time it was closed, it had roughly $100 billion queued up of outbound wires.

And I was going to go there next. And I think, again, it was a thing that Stephen Kelly wrote for us. But one of the things about 2023, I think he said it wasn't a crisis of regional banks. It was a regional bank crisis, as in specifically the region of California. Because then there were other banks that got into a lot of trouble. And the all thing they had in common  was that they were all sort of in some way connected to California. I think I remember like people were going out and looking for any bank that had California in the title in some way and betting against them.

Of course, the second bank that we closed that Sunday was Signature Bank, which operated a crypto network, but also had a very real business. It is a New York City bank that was deeply involved in New York City multifamily real estate.  You, at the same time, Joe, had people worried about commercial real estate. But what we were seeing was that the banks with the highest percentage of uninsured deposits, they were being badly battered almost immediately."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 27, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1000.988, "text": " So ultimately, a decision was made to expand the deposit insurance net and basically bail out SVB customers and others.

Is there like a legacy from that decision?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 28, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1017.745, "text": " It's a very big deal and it's one that in many ways is still hard to live with the decision even though it was the right decision, I think. Here's how it works. The federal law basically directs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the FDIC, to resolve a failed bank at the least cost  to the deposit insurance fund. That's the fund that everyone pays into with their bank deposits and it builds up a fund to pay for certain bank failures and make sure deposits are made whole. And here's what was interesting about Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and then later First Republic, it was a super majority of uninsured deposits. That means a bank failure is not that expensive  to resolve. The cost to the deposit insurance fund for a bank that is 90% plus uninsured is going to be pretty low. And if the law says resolve it at the least cost, in many ways the best case is sometimes to liquidate it.  make as many people whole as possible and top them up with the deposit insurance fund. But there is a proviso in the law which says that if a failure is likely to lead to systemic effects or to threaten the viability of the US financial system, there's a process  of key turning that a series of regulators must go through to recommend to the treasury secretary who must consult with the president to authorize the FDIC to take a different path. So over the weekend, the Sunday after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Sunday morning, roughly, Signature Bank was taken into receivership, First Republic was  a zombie and basically dead already. There was a decision where the FDIC board, we voted to turn that key and the Federal Reserve Board had voted to turn that key. And ultimately the Treasury Secretary discussed it with the president and activated that authority. The authority essentially led to the backstopping of all uninsured deposits.

There was lots of issues we dealt with when it comes to fraud and identity theft. There were certainly issues when it comes to the shift of where money was being stored. Many people believed that the app they were using to send money had money in a bank account somewhere, but in fact, maybe it was in an uninsured account.  So I think that we should be looking at payments in terms of what is the ambitions of those companies and why do they want it. We worked hard  with global central banks and regulators to inject more competition. Apple, for example, had a real chokehold over iOS devices, only allowing Apple Pay to be used.

So I think it's really important that we do not have payments and money controlled by any real big commercial player.

I really worry that if we keep having enormous flows from banks to these money funds, we are essentially going to create problems with how we transmit and intermediate credit to the real economy.  I would argue that a stable coin, if it was a tokenized bank deposit versus a tokenized money market fund, has a lot of different effects long term. Most of us know that banks are still the key to lend to small businesses, to lend to farms, and to lend to the real economy. If you are essentially putting a thumb on the scale,  toward money market funds or tokenized money market funds, the beneficiaries are very large firms, sovereigns, and others who can access those money markets.

When Silicon Valley Bank was failing, where was all the money flowing to?  they were taking their money out of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and others, it went to the very big guys because every investor believes that these banks are essentially always going to be protected.

We partnered closely with Senate Democrats under the leadership of Chuck Schumer to strongly and uniformly oppose Donald Trump's one big ugly bill. And I'm confident that Senate Republicans will continue  to rubber stamp Donald Trump's extreme judicial choices, and Senate Democrats will continue to aggressively push back on behalf of the American people. This whole situation that America has found itself in over the last six-plus months has been one big corrupt, chaotic, and cruel project  that has been unleashed on the American people and it continues. I mean this Texas thing shouldn't surprise anyone because despite the claims by house Republican leaders that the American people have fallen in love with these extremists in the house of representatives and so they're acting upon a mandate. Give me a break. The only reason  The only reason that house Republicans even have a majority right now is because they stole three seats from the people of North Carolina. North Carolina is a 50 50 state. Donald Trump narrowly won the state in 2024. It's a democratic governor, a democratic lieutenant governor, a democratic attorney general, democratic elected officials across the state.  of North Carolina who won on the same day. North Carolina is a 50-50 state. The North Carolina Congressional Delegation, which previously had fair congressional lines, produced a 50-50 congressional delegation. Seven Democrats, seven Republicans, as recently as January 2nd of this year. That was the makeup of the North Carolina Congressional Delegation. What happened?  Republicans engaged in mid-decade redistricting in a 50-50 state that had fair maps and produced an evenly divided delegation, and took it from 7-7, stole three seats that were in Democratic hands from the people of North Carolina as a result of illegitimate mid-decade congressional gerrymandering, and turned that delegation into 10 Republicans and four Democrats.  There's a three seat difference in the House of Representatives right now when Republicans are at full strength and Democrats are at full strength. 220 Republicans to 215 Democrats. That entire difference, the majority that Republicans have can be explained solely by the fact that they cheated in North Carolina. These people have zero credibility.  in terms of the issues that they're allegedly championing on behalf of the American people. If you believed in your ideas and the power of your issues, then why are you trying to cheat now in Texas, just like you did in North Carolina? The problem that Republicans confront is that the Texas congressional map is already gerrymandered.  And so this gerrymander may actually turn into a dummy-mander because they are going to create a situation where four, five, six, seven, eight Republicans who are currently in safe districts are going to be on the front line of our efforts to flip seats, particularly in a midterm election where Donald Trump is deeply unpopular and his signature one big ugly bill.  is deeply unpopular. Imagine a group of people, this is how corrupt they are, who in the middle of a search and rescue operation that is taking place in Texas right now, dozens of children drowned to death. Some of that has to do with incompetence in the Texas state government and incompetence in the Trump administration.  And instead of actually trying to be there for the people of Texas and the hill country, children at summer camp, who's lost their lives, they call a special session. And the main reason for that special session is to try to steal the midterm elections by rigging the Texas congressional map. These people are complete and total embarrassment.  The American people are not going to stand for it. And things aren't going to get better for them. Politically, they're only going to get worse.

It's a honor, great honor, to have a friend of mine who's become very friendly over the last number of years. We knew each other before, but Mark is the head of NATO, Mark Rutte, Secretary General of NATO. Highly respected by everybody that knows him, but in particular the European countries. They have great reliance on him.  And he's done a fantastic job. And we had a tremendous meeting. I guess it's about a month now, a month ago. And I think Mark will tell you that it was really, perhaps, more important the date of November 5th. That was the election day. Maybe that was the most important, because we've made tremendous progress together. And one of the reasons that you're here today is to hear that we are very unhappy \u2014 I am \u2014 with Russia.  But we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with them. And we're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. Tariffs at about 100 percent. You call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine.  And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it. And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there. So based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. It's very simple. And they'll be at 100 percent. And that's the way it is. It can be more simple. It's just the way it is. I hope we don't have to do it.  But regardless, we are going to be. We make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's missiles. You saw that recently in Iran, the way those planes flew in, they had every single 14 bombs at every target. Then you had the helicopter shoot a total of 30 bombs, 30 missiles, and they hit every single mark. Is that right? Every single piece, every single target.  And it was, I guess, on a scale of 0 to 10, they say it was about a 15. That's how successful it was. That's how lethal it was, a word they like to use nowadays. But it was an amazing, well-organized attack.  that people in this country want to do for 24 years. You know, when we had the pilots in last week, they were saying, Sir, we've been practicing this for 24 years, meaning people, not them, but other people that are a little older now, but they too. And you were the one that let us do it. But we've been practicing it three to four times a year for 22, 24 years.  Because they always knew they had to stop Iran from doing what they were doing, which is trying to come up with a nuclear weapon, a nuclear bomb. And we did it very successfully. And we make the best equipment, the best missiles, the best of everything.  But the European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too.  We're in for a lot of money and we just, we don't want to do anymore and we can't. But we make the best and we're going to be sending the best to NATO and in some cases to maybe, at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany where they're going to send early on missiles.  And they'll be replaced, and NATO is going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here. He's a great ambassador, and Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So in a nutshell, we're going to make top of the line weapons and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something and it'll be mostly in the form of a replacement.  And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy for having had the career that he's had. He had an amazing career before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months. And if you could say a few words. Absolutely."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 314.587, "text": "No, no, Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision, and the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you don't want Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent.  but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production. So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have Kingdom and Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more.  So what we'll do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need, so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning, as Pete Hicks said, at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment, if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them. So I really want to thank you for that, and at least the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here. So really, thank you. This is important. Thank you. SECRETARY KERRY."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 441.349, "text": "You did a great job. That's a really great job.  We've been very successful in settling wars. You have India-Pakistan. You have Rwanda and the Congo. That was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled. And they did. And they were both great, great leaders. And they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years.  And at least 7 million people killed and killed with a lot of pretty rough weapons like machetes, heads chopped off, going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near, so frightening. And we got that one solved.  Serbia, Kosovo, Bethesda. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I use. I use trade for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars. That was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here.  The strip, the Gaza Strip, I call it the Gaza Strip, one of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace. It brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Whitkoff is here, and I think we could have something fairly soon to  talk about. And we solved another one, one that we just seem to have Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with an extra neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which  closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we're working on that one. It's a problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that. You've been hearing about that one. And that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam.  But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income and life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia.  I'm not happy, and I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started. If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye.  But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they're going to have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. I was outside looking in. And I said, you know, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said.  And it started and it's a real mess. We're losing. I guess they're losing five or six thousand people. There's actually now more. I used to I was saying five thousand. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up. It's a horrible war and it should be stopped. And so if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing. Secondary tariffs and they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do. But I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk. And then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people. It's got to stop. That's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States going to NATO, et cetera.  And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance.  They still would have had no chance if the equipment, they had the best equipment, because we do make the best planes and missiles. And we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. We have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about the Golden Dome. It's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage because somebody has to use that equipment.  And they fought with tremendous courage and they continue to fight with tremendous courage, but they don't have, they're losing on equipment and Russia's really taken a very positive, very, very  strong, I mean, what they've done in the last couple of weeks."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 750.259, "text": "Without military reasons, that's what they are doing. 700 drones a day, missiles, bombing cities.
