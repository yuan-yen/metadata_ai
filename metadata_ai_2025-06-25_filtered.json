Yesterday, Iran launched several missiles against AUAB. Many of those missiles were successfully intercepted due to the combined efforts of the U.S. and Qatari armed forces. Thankfully, no Americans or Qataris were hurt.  In further announcements today, Secretary Rubio has landed along with the President at the NATO Summit at The Hague. As the Secretary has noted, under President Trump's decisive leadership, we're driving historic change at NATO.  Also this week, the United States will participate in the 55th Organization of American States General Assembly in Antigua and Barbuda, where we will engage with regional partners to advance our shared goals to make for a safer, stronger, and more prosperous hemisphere.  Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau will lead the U.S. delegation, reinforcing our commitment to supporting Rosa Maria P\u00e1ez's candidacy to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, addressing the crisis in Haiti, and countering the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the Western Hemisphere.  In addition, today, the Department of State's Rewards for Justice program announced a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the location, recovery, and safe return of Mahmoud Shah Habibi.  Mr. Habibi was abducted and detained by the Taliban's General Directorate of Intelligence on August 10, 2022. He has not been heard from since that time, and the so-called Taliban government has not yet provided any information about Mr. Habibi's whereabouts or condition.  We encourage anyone with information on Mr. Habibi to contact Plus 1 202-702-7843. That is Plus 1 202-702-7843 via signal, telegram, or WhatsApp.  or go to rewardsforjustice.net. That again is an up to a $5 million reward for Mahmoud Shah Habibi for his safe return. And again, that is rewardsforjustice.net. Excuse me. Excuse me, Matt, please. I'm more of an announcement here. To conclude today,  The United States condemns the brutal and cowardly attack on the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church and offers its condolences to the victims and their families.  We call on the Syrian government to hold all perpetrators of violence accountable and ensure the security of all Syrians, including members of religious and ethnic minorities. As Ambassador Barak has said, the United States continues to support the Syrian government as it fights against forces seeking to create instability and fear in their country and in the broader region.

One of the most transparent men we've known. Americans in the world have watched all of this unfold, I think, in a very clear way, and certainly with the leader of the free world, of the world, really, essentially, and Donald Trump making it clear his opinion. And this is what also, I think,  keeps things moving. With any ceasefire dynamic, it's fragile. And in the meantime, of course, things did come together and there has been quiet in that region. He did make clear his feelings about that. But as I mentioned in the opening that he said, gosh, just a couple of hours ago, both Israel and Iran wanted to stop the war equally. It was my great honor to destroy all nuclear facilities and capability and then stop the war.  So, obviously, the president has believed from the beginning that diplomacy can stop wars, that it is the thing that we should rely on. He leaned into that, and it's continuing to work. This is a dynamic now that is in play and is, I think, steady, as he has, I believe, also recognized based on his comments."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 328.942, "text": " And then on his comments about China being able to continue to purchase oil from Iran, how did this come together?

The president has signaled what he expects, what he is looking forward to. This is a cabinet and a government that acts to the nature of what he says and what he  he wants. And in this case, of course, I'm not going to discuss what that process will be, the nature of any of the applications via the various departments in this government. But clearly, we are focused on making sure that that guiding hand of President Trump prevails and moves this government forward. So we will have to wait and see when it comes to what that ends up looking like. All right. Yes, Andrea. Well, just to follow up, does that mean, I mean, just to translate,  Are we lifting sanctions? Has anything happened to make that possible? I'm not going to get ahead of the president or try to guess at what his strategy will be. But it will be one that will benefit this country. And that, again, he's very clear. I think the difference is, obviously, sometimes you don't hear ahead of time about the trajectory of a president. With President Trump, he speaks honestly with us. So I would suggest to not.  translate, to not speculate or guess, but to watch because things happen quickly and I think we'll find out sooner than later."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade"], "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 431.314, "text": "Yes ma'am, one more."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade"], "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 432.497, "text": "Quick follow up on something.

Well, a conclusive comment for me would be coming from the President of the United States. I have great admiration for you, Andrea Mitchell, but I think he might know more than you do at this point, more than I, more than any one of us here. At the same time, obviously, the information that we receive, that the American people receive, which will be public, will take some time, but President Trump has indicated his  pleasure at the success of that raid, which obviously was very limited in scope.

Americans appreciate that about him, the nature of how he looks at the issue of national security and safety.  And he has in the past addressed the issue of relationships with this country, keep other nations secure, that we are a good friend to have, that a friendship with the United States assists and helps facilitate the natural national security of another nation.  I look at that in his approach in certain things, and that's been certainly his attitude about it. And it seems to be a correct one. It's one I agree with. So I think we'll see that if that in fact is the case here. And we'll find out. All right. Yes, ma'am.  Is there any sort of monitoring mechanism for the ceasefire if it continues to hold? Will there be a third party that is making sure that both sides are adhering to the ceasefire? Well, as the State Department, I can't really speak to that. I think that's a DOD question and certainly a White House question. And then how do you view the next steps for nuclear talks potentially resuming in light of the ceasefire? Is there anything  on the schedule, any follow-on conversations between the two sides to try to resume the talks that had been scheduled? Well, I can't speak to a schedule. I can't... I'm not going to guess or speculate about when something might happen. What we do know, and President Trump throughout this process had been tweeting about the fact that this would be a good time for negotiations to renew, for these talks to renew. Of course, with some disappointment that it got to this point. He has been committed  to diplomacy and to discussions. Obviously, he's displayed that for these last five months. And I would think that that has not changed. So the commitment, not just from President Trump, but also from Secretary Rubio, to minimize the need and go out of your way for the need to not  engage militarily is clearly a hallmark for him and his view of national security and foreign policy, as it is for Secretary Rubio.

And there are reports that Qatar has tried to mediate nuclear talks, tried to restart those. Are you receptive of  Qatari efforts at this point? Well, that's not something I can address in any detail at all. I do know that the president was very confident in his assertion of the destruction of those sites. That was necessary because of the point that he's had from the start of this, which is that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. That has been a very singular, clear point. And the understanding is now they're not going to have one.  And that clearly might open the door for the people involved in those kinds of decisions about how to move forward. And the strikes indicated that. It was a very distinctive, limited strike regarding the issue that was in the forefront of the president's mind that he made clear over and over again, that they will not have a nuclear weapon.

It has been his hallmark from the start, and that has not changed. What we can say, and just as a reminder, Saeed, there is a deal on the table. Hamas must stop acting recklessly and accept it. As Special Envoy Whitcoff has said, Hamas's recent response to the offer was totally unacceptable and only takes us backward.  It hasn't been that long, right? A lot of stuff is happening in a short period of time. But the fact of the matter is, is that we've never stopped working for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. We've never stopped wanting that to end, to get us out of that repetition.  of something that has certainly made the first victims, the people of the Gaza Strip, and then everyone else. It's a reflection of what needs to end and what has been the problem. President Trump has made clear to, in this case, Hamas specifically, that they will face consequences.  If they continue to hold hostages, which they do, including those who have already passed away and those who are still living, Hamas has rejected repeated ceasefire proposals and therefore bears sole responsibility for how this is continuing. Saeed, if you have a chance, I don't know if you do in your work, to pose the same question to Hamas.  I hope you might be asking them.

And Deputy Special Envoy John Cole led the discussions on U.S.-Belarus bilateral relations, which resulted in the release of 14 long-held political prisoners from Estonia, Japan, Latvia, Poland, Sweden, and Belarus.  And that is the result of what you can do with diplomacy, with envoys, and with a commitment to peace and freedom for people around the world.

I'm talking about the Chinese artificial intelligence breakthrough known as DeepSeek, remember that? Which caused Wall Street to turn its back on the AI data center cohort. Earlier this year, we were told that the Chinese had come up with a way to build AI models using far less hardware, meaning chips from NVIDIA. And it crushed every stock in the group.  With the biggest casualties being the stocks of all the companies needed to create high-speed computing and generative artificial intelligence.  Today, the deep-seek nightmare officially came to a close, as data center tech led the way back up, driving the averages to near their all-time highs, Dow jumping 507 points, S&P climbing 1.1%, NASDAQ pole-voting 1.43%. How's the pleasure? Almost back to where it was before everything started getting kerflooey.  This rally is a total reputation of everything you heard back in January when we accepted that China had beaten us in AI. It was almost a replay of the Sputnik affair when the Soviets launched the first satellite to orbit the Earth on October 4th of 1957.  Back then, we had an inferiority complex about the Soviet Union like we have now about China. We decided we were finished. We'd never catch up to them in the space race. But not only did we catch them, we leapfrogged them, and we never looked back. When the deep-sea news broke, Wall Street exhibited the same inferiority complex, and everything AI-related got hammered. Everyone just accepted that China had come up with something revolutionary that made all of our artificial intelligence efforts pointless.  They know nothing! Almost no one dug into Deep Sikh's highly misleading numbers. But just like with the Russians in 1957, it was all chimerical.  We never heard from the Chinese again, did we? Except that they were willing to go to the mat to get their hands on NVIDIA second-rate semiconductors. Not even the best of them. We were never going to give them that. It didn't work. Our governments came to some sort of agreement. But we didn't give them the chips they wanted. Chips they wouldn't have been going begging for if Deep Sikh Sputnik had been a real breakthrough.  Why didn't any of the naysayers and pessimists put that two and two together? If they had, they would have stayed in these stocks, as we did for my travel trust. This data center renaissance, so shocking to the people who abandoned these stocks, the NVIDIAs, the AMDs, the Vertivs, the Microns, the Marvell Technologies, are all back or nearly back. And the story that NVIDIA CEO Jensen Wang calls the new industrial revolution is once again front and center. It's like deep-seek never happened. The AI stocks,  They're all breaking out. Of course, success has many fathers, and this rally is about more than just the data center. Just a week ago, we were trembling about what would happen in the Middle East. As we watched oil prices climb and climb, the decline in oil earlier this year had been our hope to offset the rising price of tariffed goods, but suddenly was going away because of the war between Israel and Iran. Stocks which had tried to climb back once again seemed ready to roll over. It felt like only oil stocks were worth five  For all its prowess, Israel seemed unable to stop Iran's nuclear program on its own. But then, this weekend, President Trump bombed Iran's three big nuclear enrichment sites, and suddenly Iran no longer had a viable path to become a nuclear power. Of course, Wall Street wasn't really worried about the Iranian nukes at all. It was worried about the price of crude.  The usual pessimists assume that Iran would shut down the Straits of Hormuz, blocking 20 percent of the world's oil supply. But that would have represented a major escalation. And without a functional nuclear program, they just didn't have the cards. In fact, Iran is desperate for money, which means they need to keep the Straits open, not closed, to sell their own oil, 1.7 million barrels a day.  Once the Bakke thesis got taken off the table, oil plummeted from $78 and change at its highs yesterday to the mid 60s today. It's given up all of its gains since the mini war began. And I think, by the way, that oil has got a lot more downside.  With crude going in the right direction, we're back in the declining inflation story. It wasn't enough to get Fed Chief Jay Powell on board with rate cuts today. He just told Congress that he wants to wait and see. But there is enough slowness in the economy, particularly in housing and autos, that I think we'll definitely get rate cuts at some point this year, tariff or not.  That's the other leg of this rally that's driving up so many stocks. But now, I got to go back to this thing that I know you care about so much. This tech situation, this deep-seek affair, is one of the most instructive stories I've come across in years of trading. It's a microcosm of everything that causes people to get the market wrong, to lose money, to write off stocks in bizarre embrace of American mediocrity.  In a market with the memory of a Mayfly, it may be impossible to remember, but DeepSeek's ability to do so much more with less went almost unquestioned because it was China. And if DeepSeek's numbers were real, which I don't think they were, then all the hyperscalers, the Microsofts, the Googles, the Amazons, the Orals, were wasting billions upon billions of dollars on unnecessary AI hardware.  If you believe Dream Seek, it meant that virtually every tech executive was an idiot. Our tech titans, we were told, had lost their minds. All that build-out simply could not be justified. We had visions of tens of billions of dollars worth of write-downs. So you had to sell every one of these tech stocks."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 351.597, "text": "Every one!"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 352.419, "text": "And that's exactly what happened.  For months on end, I told you it was a mistake and a handful of experts called out DeepSeek's numbers. But for the most part, nobody listened except CNBC investing club members. And we will convene tomorrow noon to talk about it. These AI companies became the punchline of endless jokes about overvaluation, with the biggest joke of all being NVIDIA.  You couldn't go a day, make that an hour, without hearing about all the brilliant hedge funds that sold NVIDIA, could you? The company which had been leading a new industrial revolution suddenly became a one trick pony, a semiconductor maker that needed China to make its numbers. But it wasn't going to be allowed to sell it. So what do you do? You had to sell, sell, sell.  Those of us who champion the data center in general, and NVIDIA specifically, look washed up, clinging to a thesis that had been defrocked by the Chinese. We tried to argue that perhaps the whole thing was highly misleading, but DeepSeek never actually disclosed their full costs, including their hardware costs. Yeah, they didn't even tell you what they spent on chips and servers. Yet somehow their numbers were treated as gospel, and anyone who questioned them, they were regarded as insane. Now looking back, with so much of tech bordering on new highs, it's clear that these stocks never should have been sold in the first place.  because Deep Seek simply wasn't that meaningful. With the data center story back on, all those analysts and hedge fund managers, newsletter writers, have to try to get back into these stocks.  the ones they dumped at much lower levels. They might be able to get back in if we have a tariff fiasco, maybe they can have an earnings report or two, but I think they'll be left behind. The bottom line here, the deep seek affair made so many money managers believe that Mark Zuckerberg from Meta, Andy Jassy from Amazon, Larry Ellison from Oracle, Satya Nadella from Microsoft, Sundar Pichai from Alphabet were all a bunch of morons.

Thank you, Jim. Wonderful to be with you.  As the averages rebound in response to a possible detente in the Middle East, we're now back to levels last seen in February, before the whole market got derailed by President Trump's tariff agenda. Four months ago, everybody was really ready to give up on all speculative stocks that had been flying lately. People were eager to throw in the towel on anything connected to artificial intelligence, with the whole AI complex getting crushed until the market-wide bottom in early April. But now all these groups are on fire again. It's like the tariff turmoil and the open conflict with Iran never happened.  Throughout this period, including at the top of tonight's show, I always told you that nothing had really changed on the business side, that the AI bull market was just as strong as it was in January, if not stronger. I thought it made no sense to give up on such a powerful story, which meant the AI stocks got cheaper as they went lower. And now we know that was true. So today I want to think about what it means to say that we have a long-term bull market in artificial intelligence, one that can get knocked down, but like Chumbawamba, gets back up again.  That's why we're going off the charts with the help of Joe Fami. He's the portfolio manager at Zur Capital LLC. He's also the founder of JoeFami.com Education, because he's got a unique take on the situation. When you look back, we've had a bull market in all things AI going back to late 2022, early 2023. You can argue about the exact start date, but certainly by May of 2023, the AI revolution was upon us, because that's when NVIDIA, the backbone of artificial intelligence, delivered one of the greatest earnings reports I've ever seen.  And aside from a detour earlier this year, the stocks never really looked back. We know that in terms of money-making potential, AI is more of an enterprise technology than a consumer technology. But Fahmy points out that ChatGPT was still the fastest application to reach 100 million users in history. ChatGPT got there in two months after it launched. TikTok took 13 months, Instagram 26 months, Snapchat 39 months, Facebook 42 months.  I've been telling you that AI represents the next industrial revolution, and Fahmy sees it the same way. Just like railroads, personal computers, cell phones, the Internet, AI can help us boost productivity, and higher productivity translates into higher stock prices across a whole host of industries. That's why he thinks it's safe to compare the AI bull market to the great Internet boom from 1995 through early 2000. Normally, when someone makes a comparison to the dot-coms, they're implying that the bubble will burst and we'll all end up in tears.  And it's true that dotcom collapse was terrible. But man, the late 90s gave us one of the greatest bull markets I've ever seen. People made fortunes and they kept those fortunes as long as they were disciplined enough to ring the register on some big gains. Follow me once to make this comparison more explicit. If the bull market is following in the footsteps of the dotcoms, then we've got two or three more years of incredible gains. Years. Take a look at a chart from Bespoke Investments comparing the action in the Nasdaq composite  from the mid to late 90s in blue to the current moment in red. He starts this with the release of Netscape at the end of 1994. This first chart shows you how the Nasdaq roared in the first three years following the launch of Netscape, which is a real game changer in terms of Internet access. Fahmy says if you look at the AI bull market from the launch of Chad GPT, their trajectories, well, they're kind of ridiculously similar.  Now here's another chart that shows you how things played out for the Nasdaq Composite in the five years following the launch of Netscape. So if Fahmy's even partially right, we could have a lot more gains in the AI cohort over the next two or three years.  Of course, that doesn't mean you should go all in AI here. Even though 1995 and 2000 was one of the greatest bull markets in history, there was insane volatility along the way. For instance, in late 1997, we witnessed a horrific, horrific correction thanks to the East Asian currency crisis. In the summer of 1998, we took a beating from the Russian debt default and the collapse of a highly levered hedge fund that was called Long Term Capital Management.  Take a look at how the S&P 500 traded in 1998, okay? It's really important because we had a terrible summer followed by a terrible fall.  The market only recovered after the Federal Reserve stepped in with an emergency rate cut in October of that year. 1998 was so bad I'd almost put my hedge fund out of business. But then we came roaring back. The S&P raised all of its losses by December. And 1999 was one of the best years on record. So even if FOMI is right that we're in the middle of a five-year bull market in AI, one that could last until 2027, we're still going to see plenty of corrections, some shakeouts, some pullbacks along the way. In fact, we just escaped from one, didn't we?  Fahmy points out that coming out of the correction in late April of this year, we caught an incredibly bullish technical signal. It's called a Zwei breath thrust, named after my late hero, Marty Zwei. This is when the 10-day moving average of the percentage of advancing stocks goes from below 40% to above 61.5% within the 10 trading days. When that happens, it shows a decisive change in momentum. You know, we've seen only 19 of these moments since World War II, and all 19  have led to above average returns over the next 12 months. Well, maybe we're going to join them up. Fahmy also points out that there's been an insane level of call option buying, specifically call options, that expire in June and December of 2027. It's been happening in Amazon and Google, Nvidia, Tesla.  Broadcom surface. Now, if the bulls are right, then these stocks can take up the entire market. We've seen that before, haven't we? At the same time, he notes that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF, the SMH, has been consolidating for the past year. That looks poised to break out to the upside. Big consolidation upside.  Given that NVIDIA's been roaring lately, while Taiwan Semi and Broadcom have also started working their way higher, he's feeling very bullish about the chipmakers. I also like the action in AMD and Marvell. Of course, this is not just about the bull market and AI. Whether or not the Fed cuts rates at its next meeting, it's very likely that rates will go lower over the next 12 to 24 months, not higher. And lower rates are almost always good for the broader stock market.  Look, if the AI boom is really a sequel to the dotcom boom, then that's good for more than just the AI stocks. We had all sorts of big winners the late 90s because people felt so good about the stock market. So here's the bottom line. The charges interpreted by Joe Family suggest that the AI bull market is following closely in the footsteps of the dotcom boom, which would mean we've likely got two or three more years of gains.  even if we definitely won't get there in a straight line. Keep that in mind the next time something happens that makes you want to give up and sell everything. Let's go to Michael in New York. Michael. Hello, Jim. How are you? Booyah. Booyah, Michael. I'm in Arizona, but I'm from the Bronx.  I have a question concerning CrowdStrike. I purchased it in 2020. I'm up 649%. It got to 10%. I sold a third. I got my principal back as well as a significant profit. It is back up to 8% of my holdings. Do I hold it or do I take more profits?  Many disciplines involved here. Obviously, you exercised the first discipline. That was terrific. Next discipline, you're a little bit too overweighted in CrowdStrike, but I do like CrowdStrike very much. Why don't you take it down a percent? Just take it down to seven. And then I think you let it go. It's a little bit more like what we do with the Travel Trust. We'll talk about it again tomorrow at noon. But thank you for sharing that with us. You know, I think CrowdStrike is terrific. The charts, as interpreted by Joe Fami, suggest that this AI bull market has a lot of similarities to the dot-com boom, with some outsized gains still to come.  So just remember that the next time you want to give up and sell everything. Much more mad money, including my sit down with the CEO of MasterCard. I'll get engaged in what kind of disruptions these stable coins might be posing to the business. Fresh off the company's annual shareholder meeting. Then discipline will always trump conviction in the stock market. I'll tell you why it's more relevant now than ever. And of course, all your calls rapid fire tonight's edition of The Lighting Round. So stay with Kramer.  Over the past couple weeks, Visa and MasterCard, two of my favorite companies, have pulled back sharply from their all-time highs. Wall Street's suddenly worried about the whole payments industry might be threatened by advances in crypto, especially now that Congress looks like it'll pass this genius act, which establishes a framework for regulating stablecoins. Visa fell over 10 percent from its high set on June 11th to its low last Friday. MasterCard dropped more than 11 percent over the same period, though both stocks have rebounded this week.  In part, that's because there's no reason these companies can't deal with stablecoin, too. In fact, MasterCard already supports a bunch of them. This morning, I spoke with Visa CEO Ryan McInerney. And Ryan told me, I think, a story which made me feel like that you'd be nuts to be in this, frankly. And McInerney's a very smart guy. But I got another guy I want to hear from. This is Michael Mieback. He's the CEO of MasterCard. After the company's annual meeting earlier today to find out what he thinks. Mr. Mieback, welcome back to Man Money.

So when you think about what we do as a company, it's kind of all relevant payment choices. Somebody wants to be paid or pay with a debit card, credit card, prepaid, whatever, you name it, we have it. And as of late, that does include Stablecoin. There are some use cases where Stablecoin does add some value.  There are niche opportunities, but let's think about why that is and what is new about stablecoins. So fundamentally, if you look at innovation in payments, it always comes down to a couple of central things. People got to trust it. They got to understand what is it doing. It's going to be simple and it's going to be secure. That's the standard for debit, credit, prepay. Everything has ever happened. Buy now, pay later, you name it. So stablecoins.  in itself is a rail. So we have leaned in because we said, OK, it actually does help with some use cases. Let's take its cross-border payments.

Jim, I wanted to ask you, what do you think about this company, and is it a good time to possibly enter? It's ACHR, Archer Aviation. OK, Archer and Joby. Again, I'm going with them. Why? Because a news headline, and it can be up 25%. That's what I'm looking for these days. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the conclusion of the lightning round.  The firm's been busy lately putting through a lot of your calls about speculative stocks. I don't mind. I actually like it. You can make a lot of money speculating.  But remember, you haven't really made any money until you sell something. It's all conjecture otherwise. No matter how much you love these speculative winners, you don't have a gain until you actually ring the registry. At the end of last week, for example, Hims and Hers Health, the online health care company, was trading at $64. But then yesterday, the stock fell 22 bucks for almost 35% decline. The cause?  The company had to deal with Novo in order to sell its Miracle Weight Loss drug, Wegovy. Novo canceled the deal, charging hims and hers with deceptive marketing, something the company vigorously disputes. Now, I don't want to go into particulars here because I don't care about particulars. What I care about is that this stock had almost tripled in two months. If you own hims and hers up almost 200 percent and you hadn't sold any at that point,  You were being a knucklehead. Why? Because this is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market. 35% of the share sold short. A lot of people are betting against it. The haters are plentiful. In that situation, the stock can erupt on any good news. And there was a lot of good news when HIMS was making money with the McGovey deal.  But a lot of those gains came on the backs of the short sellers who were forced to cover or buy back the shares they sold short because they couldn't take the pay. That's why when a stock goes up that fast and there's a big short position, you've got to generate some discipline here. You've got to let discipline trump your conviction. Maybe you have to take something off the table. It's not a case of suddenly hitting a stock that you love.  It's simply that the gains don't count until you ring the register. You can love a stock and still sell some of it. Gradually selling your winners on the way up is responsible money management. Now, this kind of thing is happening all over the place right now. A little worrisome. Take CoreWeave. This is the company that came public at $40 a share, a company I recommended and pushed incredibly hard to you. People didn't believe me. Many chose to bet against the stock. 32% of the shares are sold short.  On Friday, CoreWeave hit a high of $187. Stock still sits at $172 and change. Short imported great quarter. But a lot of this move is because so many people were betting against it because the company picked a bad time to come public. I had tremendous conviction that CoreWeave would make a big move, but not this big. Again, I think discipline must trump conviction. And you got to do some selling here. Sell, sell, sell, sell.  While I still like the stock, I recognize that much of this move was powered by panic short sellers. Take something off the table, please. Finally, there's Circle Internet Group. Again, I have conviction that this company has a bright future in the red hot stable coin market. But I care about the stock price, not just the company.  Less than three weeks ago, Circle Internet came public at $31. It's now at $222 and change, and that's after a 15% decline today. You may think you've made a fortune in this one. However, you've made nothing until you ring the register. I'm not questioning your conviction. I'm questioning your sanity. How can you not at least take your cost basis out?  You can let the rest run. That way you're playing with the house's money. That's the ideal place to be because you'll never lose. Look, I know a lot of stocks are going nuts here. It's sensational. Some of these moves are short squeezes. Others are because of overexuberance. The last thing you want to hear is some old geezer telling you how to sell part of your position.  Know this, though. I want you to make money. And you can't do that until you sell at least some of your position. So tomorrow, examine your spec winners and ring the register on at least part of those positions. Go buy yourself that you've always wanted or put it in the bank so you don't give it back.  Don't worry, I'm not saying sell the entire position. You can keep your favorite stocks. I'm not going against them. But remember, you haven't made a dime until you ring the register on part of your position. Then and only then can we say you made money in a hims and hers or a core weave or a circle internet group. I like to say there's always a bull market somewhere. And I promise to try to find it just for you right here on Bad Money. I'm Jim Cramer.

Out in our Washington, D.C. bureau, Michael McKee, Bloomberg News international economics and policy correspondent. And here in our Bloomberg Businessweek studio, we've got Alex Steele. She's gonna talk oil and the energy markets and tie it into the macro environment. Mike, first question to you, I think a lot of people  Remember just less than a week ago hearing from Fed Chair Jay Powell in the press conference. How would you characterize any differences or distinctions between what we heard today versus what we heard from him last week?  Oh, I think, Tim, that basically what you were hearing is an echo chamber today. His prepared remarks were almost word for word the same as the statement he gave at the beginning of the press conference last week. It's the sort of Hippocratic Oath of the Fed. First, do no harm to the markets. Don't move anything. And that was his goal today.  He just underlined what the Fed has been saying all along, that they're going to have to wait for more information on the impact of tariffs and the impact of other fiscal policies from the administration before they know what they will have to do. He did say that if we see inflation go down, continue to go down, and if we see unemployment go up,  Those could be two reasons to cut interest rates, but he didn't put a time frame on it and sort of leaned against the idea that they could do anything in July. So we walk away from this with pretty much the same view that we had going into it, that the Fed is not in any hurry.  All right, so let's talk about oil, because Fed Chair Jay Powell was certainly asked about oil, Alex. We've seen oil plunging, what, for a second straight day on what seems to be easing tensions in the Middle East. We just had a guest on, not really guest, she's family, Dina Esfandiari, and she said, you know, there's not a lot different, that there is still a lot of risk out there in the Middle East. Why are oil markets just kind of backing off? What's your read on it?  Yeah, also oil prices are now lower than they were before Israel's attack on Iran on the 13th of June. So what does that mean? It just means that there's more supply than demand. I mean, that's the thing, is that the oil markets can be very different than the broader geopolitical risk market, because it's pure supply and demand. In order to have a kind of supply shock, you also need strong demand. And if you don't have that kind of increasing, rising demand, you're not going to have the same kind of supply shock. And two parts of that. One is that China was stockpiling before this. So they got a lot of oil anyway.  China's the one that buys from Iran, by the way, so they would feel the shock. Apparently, this is, Reistad was reporting this earlier today, that there are ships that, with Iranian oil, just wading off of Chinese ports, so it's there. Product market may be a little different. Supplies there are a little bit lower, but they have refineries that they can run, and it'll be okay, that's why.  So Alex, does the conversation now shift about the way that oil is an economic indicator in terms of how demand for it around the world is kind of indicating the health of the economy?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 264.128, "text": "You're asking me a macroeconomic question?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 265.97, "text": "We've got McKee in DC."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 268.352, "text": "Then we're going to get Mike to weigh in. But it's about oil. So I go to Alex for oil."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 272.876, "text": "Does it reflect macroeconomic conditions? Yeah, because when we think about the narrative with oil over the last week or 12 days, it's been about, OK, tensions in the Middle East. This is why we've seen prices go up.  In more peaceful times, when we look at oil prices, we look at it for clues about demand outside of the United States, demand inside of the United States, and what that says about the macroeconomic environment. I'm laughing because when we're looking at demand concerns and lower oil prices, then we pivot and talk about the supply picture. So it's like you can't get one for one. So then if you're taking a look at the macroeconomic environment, I would also say, oh, but take a look at supply. We're still pretty well supplied. OPEC plus, really Saudi Arabia.  the world.  The volley goes to you, as Alex said. All right, macroeconomic. When it comes to oil prices, Fed Chair Jay Powell definitely asked about it in terms of concerns if we've got higher oil prices, how that feeds into higher inflation woes and worries. Jay Powell seemed to be like, unless this sticks around for a while, it's not really an issue.  Yeah, that's the way the Fed looks at it now. They went through the original sin of Arthur Burns cutting interest rates when oil prices went up during the original oil crisis in 1973. And at that time, what ended up happening, of course, is the great inflation that we saw.  And the Fed doesn't want to do that again. They've learned that you don't cut rates to deal with a supply problem like that. Instead, they would wait and see what the impact on the overall economy is. And for it to have an impact on the overall economy, it would take some time. It would have to get into other things besides just the gasoline in your tank.  get into petrochemicals, get into paint, get into pharmaceuticals, all the things that at some point use petroleum. So right now, there doesn't seem to be any reason to worry about it, particularly now that prices are going down. But the Fed chair made it clear that that's not something that's a major concern for them. And also, over the years,  Petroleum prices have become a much smaller impact on what the U.S. spends because we've gotten so much more energy efficient. So it would even take longer for that to have some sort of effect than it did back in the 70s.  I love that you went there, because that was going to be my follow-up. Alex, come back in. In terms of oil, are we going to ever see, could we see $100 a barrel oil? The way the world is moving, and even though we maybe have an administration that isn't so embracing EVs and alternative energy, has that kind of horse left the stable?  No, I don't think so. I mean, I think what the read through is that you're going to see more oil volatility, not necessarily oil price spikes that we may have seen in the last, say, 15, 20 years. And a big part of that has to do with U.S. shale. So we look at that as the reserve, right? We have so much oil, it's all good.  The problem, though, is that a lot of the really good stuff has already been drilled. So the stuff you're getting is a little gassier, so less oil, more gas. And it's getting harder and maybe more expensive to drill. It doesn't mean that shale's toast. It just means it might not have the same kind of growth rate that we're used to. So you change the world for shale. You have sanctions on Russian oil, Venezuelan oil, TBD, what happens with Iran. Yeah, sure, you could definitely get that. The question is, do we stay there? And that, I think, is the question that may not happen.  So what are the economics of exploration here in the US right now, in an environment where the president wants to have so-called energy independence in the United States, and also wants to see companies drill baby drill? So I love that he tweeted to Secretary Wright, because when I have interviewed Secretary Wright about oil, he's like, dude, I'm not an oil guy. I'm the energy guy. And then he's like, not taking that mantle. Well, Mike McKee and I did a piece on this for Wall Street Week. It was a twofer, and it was just about this very issue. What was the question? The economics.  I love it. The economics for oil exploration in an environment such as this, if oil prices aren't necessarily at $100 a barrel, like Carol's asking, then is the incentive actually there for American companies to do this expensive process? 40, they're definitely losing money. They're shutting stuff in. 50, they're recalculating what they're spending, how they're spending it, maybe on the margins. Maybe they're drilling, but they're not completing their wells. They're keeping that oil in the ground. 60s, they're fine. They can cover everything. 70s, they're golden. They're going, going, going.  Get her a role on Landman. That's what I'm going to say. She can forget the question any time she responds like that. Mike, come on back in, because as we do talk about inflation, I mean, what's the bigger concerns when it comes to inflation remaining sticky here in the United States? What is it that we really have to worry about at this point? If it's not really maybe higher oil prices or energy prices, what is it?  Well, it's been changing actually, Carol, over time. We were watching housing as a very sticky point of inflation, but house prices are starting to come down now. We saw a decline in the Case-Shiller numbers today. Overall, the housing market weakening in large part because Fed interest rates are keeping people from taking out mortgages.  So we look beyond that, and what you're really going to be looking at is the kind of things that the president is talking about tariffing. Consumer goods like clothing, which actually fell in price the last couple of months. So we're still looking for the things that are going to be sticky in inflation, but they seem to be changing.  even as we speak. So that's another reason for the Fed to step back and try to figure out which categories and why prices are staying up or going up. Mike, any addressing from the Federal Reserve Chair about the potential for a rate cut in July, given since he spoke last week we've heard a couple different Fed officials come out and say that's a possibility?  No, he stayed away from that. He was asked about it. And he said, when we get the right information about what we need, we can consider cutting rates. Did not put a time frame on it. And I might point out that we heard from Atlanta's Rafael Bostic this morning in a Reuters interview. We heard from Beth Hammack of Cleveland today. We heard from John Williams, the New York Fed president, and all of them have said"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 659.05, "text": " know to July that they think rates are going to stay higher for a little bit longer."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 664.819, "text": "Maybe September, but July doesn't seem to be the majority's view.

It did back in like 2014 because you had a lot of companies that had negative cash flow and had to borrow a lot and those rates were high and that's why you got to wash out. But there's been so much consolidation that maybe not in the same kind of way.  One last question, because it plays into the geopolitics. I mean, you see Saudi Arabia and the Middle East really kind of looking to diversify in terms of their exposure. I mean, they certainly see the energy markets as not going to be, you know, the money machine that it's been, you know, for such a long time. Are they right to? Like, will this, will oil ultimately change maybe geopolitics going forward? Just got about 30 seconds.  Yeah, it's going to be oil and everything else at the same time, and that will be a different kind of fight then when it comes to energy. It's going to be energy security and energy nationalization, but it's not necessarily going to mean oil. It can mean other forms as well. All right.

Let's head to Geneva, Switzerland, and to Bloomberg News Middle East Geo and Economics reporter Dina Esfandiari. She has worked at the International Crisis Group, the Harvard Kennedy School at King's College, London, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies. We have been dying to talk to you, Dina, and I know it's been a busy couple of weeks for you. We had a headline a little more than an hour ago, Iran's president, the Saudi crown prince, discussing the U.S. and Israel in a call. It feels like  new relationships may be being formed, maybe new alliances. You are the author of New Order in the Gulf, The Rise of the UAE. Is the order of the Gulf being rewritten as we speak?  I don't know if it's being rewritten, but it's certainly changing. A lot of things are changing at the moment. I think the Gulf Arab states were quite confident of their position in the region, of their relationship with Trump, of their new relationship with Iran a few weeks ago when Trump was visiting the region. And now things really do seem to be up in the air. They're absolutely terrified by what happened last night when Iran targeted U.S. bases in Qatar in a first  I think it caught them off guard. It is one of their biggest fears to be caught in the middle of an escalation between the U.S. and Iran, and it happened. And so I think everybody is just trying to grapple with what just happened and where we go from here. Well, it certainly seems like markets here in the U.S. are sending the signal that they're confident that this crisis has been de-escalated. And perhaps it appears that  this truce between the two countries may actually hold. Is that view, in your opinion, is that short-sighted? No, I do think that the truce will hold, but I think we're going to find ourselves in a new normal. I don't think things are going to escalate like they have over the course of the last 12 days. I'm hopeful that that has been put behind us, because I do think that President Trump is now going to wield the hammer  and try to make sure that both Israel and Iran stick to this ceasefire. And also, Israel and Iran don't want this war to extend beyond these 12 days. I think both have been badly hit, and so they are more than willing to move on.  But that doesn't mean the tensions between Israel and Iran are going to dissipate overnight. These two countries are longstanding rivals. That will continue. So I anticipate that we find ourselves in a situation where we were a few months ago, or even before October 7th, where the two sides are trading blows, but at a lower level, at a more manageable level. Will the tensions exist between Israel and Iran?  until there is or unless there is regime change in Iran? You know, the regime change question is the million-dollar question at the moment. What is for sure is that regime change isn't going to happen at the hands of Israeli and American bombs. There is discontent in Iran, but the more Iran faces external attacks, the more you have a bit of a rally around the flag effect.  on  government official to government official. It doesn't really trickle down to the people. But what happens is when you have these cycles of escalation, then that's when it trickles down to the people. That's when they start to feel it personally. So the faster these wars are dealt with, the better it is.  Hey you know on that and I'm curious in terms of tensions continuing certainly between Iran and Israel. Let me just go back to something that came out former U.S. Secretary of State under President Biden Antony Blinken in an op-ed in the New York Times critical of President Trump's  strikes on Iran. He does hope it works, though. He noted that Iran will essentially build back their nuclear enrichment capabilities. And he said, finally, while there's no doubt the American strikes set back Iran's nuclear ambitions, Iran could rebuild quickly in locations and adepts virtually immune to airstrikes while pursuing weaponization at the same time.  So he goes on to say, while their program has been significantly disrupted, and buying time is a good thing, it underscores that sticking with the JCPOA was the better option. It bought us at least 15 years ago instead of just a few, or bought us at least 15 years instead of just a few. And that was, of course, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, that 2015 agreement between Iran and several world powers. So is he right that, I mean, will these tensions continue?  Iran will continue to want to have those nuclear enrichment capabilities? Or do you think there is a truce where they say, I'm out, I'm done, realistically?  Look, I think it's really hard to imagine that Iran is going to put its hands up after facing 12 days of attacks plus a round of U.S. attacks and say, you know what, that program that we invested all that money, all that energy, all that time into, we're going to give it up just because of, you know, 12 days of airstrikes. I just don't foresee that happening.  I do foresee, however, that Iran will be willing to talk, will be willing to negotiate. But it was already willing to do that, and it was already at the negotiating table before this escalation round began 12 days ago. So I don't think that will have changed that much. But Iran does have one red line.  And that red line is the ability to continue enriching on its soil. I think Iran is going to be wedded to keeping that. It will be willing to lower the enrichment level or the amounts of stockpiles that it keeps. But I do think that symbolically it has to keep some enrichment on its soil.  There's still that question now of where that enriched uranium went. And there are also questions about the battle assessment report of what exactly those bunker busting bombs accomplished over the weekend. A lot of unknowns still here. And I'm wondering what your view is given the unknowns here and just the view of the based on the folks you've talked to the reporting out of the region.  If folks feel like that region is safer than it was 12 days ago now, as a result of what's happened? If you're asking me if we're better off now than we were 12 days ago, then I think my answer is going to have to be no. What we've achieved with these airstrikes, I think, is very little. Satellite imagery appears to indicate that the only thing that really has been affected  is the entrances to some of Iran's nuclear facilities, the three that were targeted, but not much more. Prior to that, as you mentioned, Iran had already moved some of that highly enriched uranium out of the facilities. And what you've effectively done is bolstered that Iranian desire that had been kept under a lid for a long time to really make a dash for the bomb. And  On top of that, you will have driven the program further underground, further hidden behind closed doors, buried further underground, especially now that we know that the bunker busters don't appear to be that effective. And so, to me, it looks frightening. We find ourselves in a situation where perhaps you've gained a couple of months or maybe a year, but ultimately you've re-injected Iran with a desire to go for a nuclear weapon, something which it hadn't done up until now.  Dina, what about Iran's proxy militant groups, Hezbollah and Hamas? They were refusing or unable to enter the fight in support of Iran and its Gulf neighbors were urging restraint. Will they continue to be present in whatever is the next chapter of Iran?  So I think Iran's partnerships with these groups in the region, those partnerships will endure, but the groups themselves have been weakened. It's undeniable. After over 18 months of war with Israel,  Hezbollah has been decapitated. Much of its capabilities has been affected. Even the Houthis and the fighting facing U.S. strikes were weakened. Now, all of these groups will retain some of their capabilities, but they're going through a bit of a reckoning right now and figuring out what it is that they want, what that relationship with Iran will look like in the future, how they're going to work together.  part of the reason why you've seen them be so quiet in response to this direct war between Israel and Iran. They haven't offered themselves up to help, and Iran hasn't asked them to help. Because I think both sides are trying to figure out where we go from here after being weakened.  One thing I want to ask you, China also, in a very succinct statement, criticized the U.S. strike on Iran and the nuclear facilities, reiterated that it's willing to join international efforts to restore peace in the Middle East. You've co-authored the book, Triple Axis, Iran's Relations with Russia and China. Where is China and Russia on all of this, and where will they be in the future?  Well, I think that relationship between Iran, Russia and China is going to endure. It's going to continue to grow. But they have a really weird sense of what working together as partners is like. It's very different to the way that in the West we would view alliances. Their relationship is very compartmentalized. They're distrustful of each other. They only work together when they see eye to eye and they ignore issues that they don't see eye to eye on. And that's likely to continue. It also makes Russia and China  unreliable partners in times like this, because while they will step up and condemn the attacks and pretend to side with Iran and maybe even help Iran in the UN, for example, they won't really take more concrete steps to assist Iran in its face-off with Israel and the U.S.  My last question for you is the status of the relationship between the U.S. and the Gulf states, specifically the ones that the president visited in recent weeks and touted the business and economic ties between the countries. Is that, are those relationships intact?  Well, I think from the perspective of those Gulf Arab states, they saw President Trump's visit as a big moment for them. It was kind of their reacceptance amongst the rest of the international community, and especially in the U.S. 's arms. So it was a very important moment for them.  And they felt as though they had the president's ear and they could talk to him about issues, whether bilateral or regional. And I think today they're a little bit disappointed because during that visit, they had set some red lines. They had expressed their support for the U.S.-Iran negotiations, and they had really impressed upon President Trump how critical it was that this doesn't escalate into a regional war. And that's exactly what happened.  I'm so appreciate it can tell you I we know you're busy and this was super helpful to us and we know the Bloomberg audience Tina thank you so much. Dina Esfandiari.

And Max, when we've spoken to you in the past about the driverless car technology, specifically Waymo, you've been a little skeptical about it. I think everything Craig is saying, everything you're saying is true. The questions around Waymo are business questions. Essentially,  Is this more than a very, very expensive, money-losing attraction for tourists in a handful of cities? Which it definitely is compelling in that sense. There are questions, and these are questions that even Waymo has acknowledged. They need to figure out, they need to turn this into a money-making business. They feel like they've gotten the  I think  Tesla is I think technically like a good way to think about this is they are years behind where Waymo is like Waymo was doing some of the stuff that Tesla is doing you know years ago like five years ago there are ways in which Tesla yes is  is impressive and ahead. Tesla has a lot of miles logged using its driver assistance technology, which it also confusingly calls full self-driving. But Tesla is really at the beginning of this. Even this pilot program we're talking about,  Very modest it doesn't include members of the public just a handful of influencers in a very small in a very small part of Austin So just just very early and everything that Waymo is doing both in terms of customers and then in terms on the business side Kind of makes that point just shows you how wide the gap is and how far?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 26, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1811.75, "text": "Tesla is at least at this moment from actually operating, you know a money-making robo taxi"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 27, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1817.519, "text": " All right, so this came up in the news.

Hey Craig, come on back in here because you've covered more than just these two companies and also more than just the sort of driverless element here. But a question that I have is where does this technology leave Tesla?  the traditional automakers, because there was this promise from Elon Musk years ago. I mean, I've lost count of how many years ago this was, but he basically said, your Tesla will become more valuable because you will be able to essentially set this thing free as a robo-taxi when you're not riding around in it, and you'll be able to charge for that.

Ben, great to see you. I first want to ask you about bond yields being at 4.29 on the 10-year. And I'm just wondering, because we saw, this is a day when the markets rallied. We saw oil come off precipitously with all the risk premium got taken out of the oil market at this point. And we didn't have much of a move in the bond market.

At the press conference, he was a bit more stern about it. But in this testimony, he sort of outlined the paths and how he can get to these rate cuts, and that he sees this tariff really the reason why they're holding off. He also quantified that if there were no tariffs, then rates actually could be as low as 100 basis points from here. So I think that keeps the bond in place, because  If you were to cut faster here with more, likely yields are going to rise again, like we saw last year in the fall. So I think to Danny's point, like, the Fed may have here an opportunity to cut a little bit more in September, as all this data ahead of them, and then make that decision to do a larger cut. So I think this keeps the yield a bit for more falling further than rather than actually rising.

And all we've heard of for four months is what, in terms of foreign buyers of treasuries, might be thinking and what global central banks are doing. Have you changed your tune on that at all?

There's a lot of pressure there under the long end that we could see higher yields that makes people wary. So this counter rally we're seeing currently may be really driven by more domestic players that were perhaps short, other technical factors. But I think the story in itself hasn't really changed. So I think we're going to continue to have this higher pressure on the long end of the yield curve, really, because we haven't really dealt anything away with the deficit or with inflation for that matter.

The economy in Europe is not that strong, but I think it's really about, if there is relief from geopolitical crisis, and it seems to be going to other currencies that benefit from this, in addition to that, euro and Brent are quite linked to each other. Brent is really the contract for Europe. So I think that's really what's playing there, Guy.

So Max, we'll have for you today, in no particular order, reports on enchiladas, exploding rockets, and Musk's odd computer situation. But we do indeed start in Austin with you, Cara. You were there for the launch on Sunday. What did you see?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 149.375, "text": " Yeah, so I started off bright and early, you know, 6 a.m. is when they were potentially going to start launching, so I didn't see any for hours. They ended up launching at about 2, but I live in one of the neighborhoods they're launching, so I actually was seeing some of their vehicles just driving around, you know, my neighborhood streets in the morning as we were waiting and watching streams. I ended up watching the first few rides through the stream of some of these people with early access before heading out, and  There was only a few cars out, so it was actually a bit of a game to try to find any of them."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 182.347, "text": "Okay, so in other words, like, there was no starter gun.

No, suddenly they just started popping up here and there."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 198.211, "text": " Yeah, they've been in areas of South and Southeast Austin for, I'd say, a few months now. They're not labeled RoboTaxi, the ones they've been using for testing. They're just Model Ys that they just recently refreshed. And I started noticing there's a lot with, you know, manufacturer plates just kind of popping up. Sometimes they had some roof racks with sensors on them. They're just kind of driving around. I think, you know, Elon Musk said that they're driving around in circles, and that really is what some of these neighborhoods have felt like."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 225.683, "text": " We should probably just lay out the basics of this launch.

I mean, you know, it doesn't include downtown Austin. And really importantly, there was a safety monitor in the passenger seat, which so a guy sitting in the passenger seat, a babysitter, not behind the wheel, but somehow babysitting the car in a lot of these videos.  The safety monitor has his finger on a button, which I think most people assume is an emergency brake. Is he a jackpot? Yeah, it's the button that kills you if you tweet something mean about the robotaxi while you're in it. Wait a minute, so literally the whole time he or she has their finger like just hovering over the button?  Yeah, or just kind of on it. It seems like there may have been some other types of controls or ways to provide input in the vehicle. You also have, at least according to statements that Musk and others have made on the earnings call, some teleoperation as well. So there probably, in addition to that safety monitor, is a guy sitting at a desk  watching the ride, who is also able to intervene one way or another. I don't think we know exactly what that intervention could be. It could be anywhere from sort of giving the robo-taxi some commands or suggestions all the way to maybe a steering wheel or whatever where that person  and could literally take control. But we don't know exactly what that teleoperation looks like. A lot of supervision now. Obviously the idea is at some point once this thing gets, you know, a little more experience out there, the training wheels come off and it's out on its own in the wild. Now, Cara, who got to take these initial rides? Was it just picking up random strangers on the street?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 348.652, "text": " So Friday night, a bunch of Tesla influencers and retail investors, and these are accounts that, you know, really are interacting with Elon Musk, interacting with a lot of like Tesla news at all times. That's kind of their whole brand, got emails that said, you have early access to the Robotaxi starting Sunday. And then, you know, some other Tesla fans ended up coming in and kind of going as their plus ones. They were allowed one guest per ride, but it was really just a handful of pretty loyal influencers for the most part."}, {"keywords": ["Apple", "iPhone"], "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 376.748, "text": " These are not like automotive influencers.

These are people who are very, very, very enthusiastically on the Musk train, which Karen and I found out when we tried to, when we asked them if they would take us as their, their plus one and were at least in my case.  Yeah, repeatedly denied. Right. Well, I can't blame them. In your case, I don't care. I'm just getting to know you. But in Max's case, yeah, no, I also wouldn't ride in a vehicle with you. All right. So how in general did these vehicles perform and how are they continuing to perform?

They were doing pretty predictable driving behavior when we were following them around. But there have been a few videos that  have shown some concerning behavior. There's been some mild speeding, you know, a few miles over the limit, which people are, you know, humans do too, but it is strange for a robo-taxi to speed typically. There's been one instance that a lot of people have pointed out as particularly concerning.  So there's a vehicle that was starting to turn left, appeared to maybe decide it was going to go straight instead. And the steering wheel really jerked around, and it started to go straight instead. And it was going in the wrong direction in the wrong lane for a few seconds there, and then got."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 480.988, "text": "So it was going into potentially into oncoming traffic? It did go into oncoming. It did go into oncoming. But then it got it right.  Two hours later, it got back into the well, that doesn't sound good. I mean, I almost feel like I don't need to say this, but this is very much a demonstration in a very controlled demonstration. So we're evaluating it. So so part of why Kara is bringing up these like they sound like very minor examples and they are.  except that this is a situation where there is a ton of monitoring, where the routes have been traveled over many times, where it's like a very controlled, and we're even getting, the information we're getting from these rides is also very controlled because it's being filtered through these fans. But the thing is, what they've done here  really is a long way from what Elon Musk has said they're going to do. And what he said they're going to do, just to remind people, is to be able to have any Tesla anywhere driving around unsupervised. None of that is true right now. There is a very small geographic area, a very small fleet, and there is a ton of supervision.  And I think it would have been surprising if something really bad happened with these tests. Even these minor, you know, screw-ups are a little bit surprising just because, again, this is not all that different from what we saw in October, you know, on the soundstage, right? It's just like a larger version of that thing. And which, okay, maybe that's some progress, but still.  Right. Which gets me to the next point, Cara, which is despite how sort of, you know, just okay, this whole launch seemed the stock really popped yesterday. Tesla stock did it. It rallied 8%, which by Tesla standards, cause it's a very volatile stock. It's not some enormous move. And yet 8% is 8%. It certainly did not go down. So I guess the market market's first take is like, wow, this is great. Big hit."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 608.071, "text": " Yeah, I mean, this is an event that people have been waiting years and years for. Elon Musk has really bet the entire company on autonomy, on AI, on the ability to launch a network like this. And investors are just glad it's meeting that mark on a lot of levels. They will be closely watching to see if it actually can scale from here. It is something that even the most bullish investors are really keeping an eye on right now, though."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 630.329, "text": " Yeah, I mean, is 10% in a day for Tesla a huge move? That's like a Wednesday or something, you know? Esha Day, Bloomberg Tesla reporter, told me she doesn't even get up for an 8% move. Not for Tesla, right? No, not for Tesla. Yeah, for most other stocks. So yes, correct. Look, the other thing is, for this stock,  eight percent is not a huge jump. This is a very volatile stock. But also like there were versions of this day that could have been a lot worse. Right. One thing that has surprised me, frankly, is how cautious Elon Musk is being with this launch, like it in certain ways.  Like, yes, he's putting these cars that in a lot of ways don't seem to do the thing that he says they do on public roads. On the other hand, he's kept this to be a very modest demo, I think much more modest than anybody believed or anybody would have thought. Like, he's talking about teleoperation, which is something that he hadn't talked about before, or he had said if there was teleoperation, that would be a bad sign. So in other words, like, he's being safe, at least, or maybe safer than he otherwise  could have been or some of his actions, like we didn't see as, you know, maybe concerning or whatever, as the incident we talked about with the Tesla crossing over the double line is, you know, there wasn't anything worse. So maybe it's slightly beat expectations that some people had. Apparently, the bar was pretty damn low.  Not that I'm setting a very low bar, but there also may be, like, the enthusiasm may fade because, like, the novelty here of being able to drive, like, from one end of part of Austin to the other is gonna fade. It's like the boring company ride where you can go from, like, one hotel. Yeah, from the Las Vegas Convention Center to the resorts world. You know, Max, last week when you launched your acronym, a response- Are we talking about Mammut or Madra?  There were multiple... Oh right, there were two. You had two. It was a twofer. It was a twofer. I almost forgot about MADRA. No, when you were... Okay, so when you were launching your acronyms, a bit of a riff on taco, Trump always chickens out, hence stock investors buy stocks.  We had asked our listeners, our legions of listeners, to put forth any ideas they may have for acronyms that could improve upon, if such a thing could be done, that would improve upon Mahmoud. And, you know, we got a brilliant idea. Yeah, we got some fun responses. My favorite, and Grant, who responded with a lot of good ideas, but also complaining that we hadn't seen that he had his own acronym, which was Enchilada.  Wait, so he launched it, he alleges, he launched it before you. Unfortunately, the timestamps confirm his launch. Elon never completes his innovative level four autonomous driving announcements. Wow. Enchilada. This guy, obviously, you know, something of a bear, I would guess. He also, in response to Mammut, which he thought was, you know,  insufficiently creative, suggested a few others with the help, I believe, of chat GPT, including, and now these are replacements for Mahmoud, which was Musk always makes up with Trump. These include queso, coral until eventually snuggling online, salsa, spats are allowed, still amigos, guac, grudges usually aren't consistent, burrito,  Billionaires ultimately reconcile regardless of internet tempestuous outbursts. None of them are perfect, but Grant, thank you for these ideas. They are all hilarious, and I regret missing enchilada. Grant's given this a lot of thought. I know. A lot to work with.  just about all of them, Enchilada in particular, because there's a, just a mouthful quality. It's very long. It's slightly incomprehensible. Elon never completes his innovative level for autonomous driving announcements. That's all good. But Kara, now that the robo-taxi is, is roaming the streets of Austin. Is that still true? Is Enchilada truer?

You know, you get up early and have a lot of meetings, you know, looking out at the French Riviera. I wouldn't expect you to understand. But yes, I was at Cannes Lions last week, the wonderful advertising festival. For those who are unfamiliar, it's essentially everybody in the world who is involved in the ad industry from  you know, the big players like Metas and YouTubes and Googles of the world to these agencies, to the creators who are now making a living on this. They all show up and and spend a week together sort of cutting deals and boondoggling and all that kind of stuff. So it was a good time.  Now, what was X's presence there? Because I feel like just last year, its presence was kind of odd, unique. And how did it play out this year? So last year was interesting because Elon showed up himself. And I believe he did a keynote with WPP, one of the largest ad agencies in the world, or I believe the largest ad agency. And he kind of signaled, hey, this is important to me by physically showing up and giving his time.  In years past, X, formerly known as Twitter, had literally like a beachside setup. They set up a \u2013 there was concerts that they had. They would hold meetings there. Curt was all over that. I was. That was back in the day. This was pre-COVID.  When I was there this week, I did not see a single X-branded sign throughout the entire conference. Just to give you a sense, TikTok took over an entire hotel, essentially. Meta takes over multiple floors of a hotel, has a giant beachside thing. Everyone is throwing their logo in your face, essentially. You can't walk down the street without seeing these things.  like right in front of you, X was nowhere to be seen. And I thought that was very notable. So how do I interpret this, Kurt? Are they just giving up? What does this mean? So there's two ways. I think there's a, I'll give maybe the positive X version and the more critical X version. I think the positive is it's not very doge to go to can, right? Like it is not,  for all the reasons I stated at the top. Listen, we're cutting into it a little bit. Okay, fine, I'll admit it's not the most doge thing to go to Cannes. It's definitely a show, right? It's a bit of a circus.  If you're X and Elon is running your company, maybe the last thing you want to do is be seen out here kind of frivolously spending money for a Diplo concert on the beach. I shouldn't say that. Yahoo hosted a Diplo concert. I did go, and it was pretty fun. So, you know, sorry to use that as an example, Yahoo. It was a great time. But my point is, like, maybe Elon is not wanting to be seen doing that kind of stuff right now. That's the positive, like, reason why X might not be visible.  The more negative is that, quite frankly, they either don't have the money to do those kinds of things or they're no longer in that tier as an advertiser. What do you mean they don't have the money? They're a unit of XAI. XAI's got money coming out the year. When I hear about Kurt talking about X's advertising business, I have that feeling of when you hear about a really old celebrity who you thought had already passed away, like,  years ago like it's like oh yeah x has an advertising business i completely forgot because david like you said they are now part of xai and it really seems like this whole part you know this whole revenue stream they're just soylent they're simply soylent for the xai robots not necessarily the metaphor i would have used but yes that's exactly what i mean that's the the cynical way to look at it right is that x is sort of now the  You know that any money they make a gravy and it's the back burner to this much more important thing which is that they're using the data to power xai and that's really all that matters and so. You know if that's the way that that x is it's certainly nowhere near the top of the conversation that it was several years ago in the advertising industry but maybe it has a different purpose now to your point.  But now Max had just said a minute ago that, oh my God, right, X advertising, you know, it's just a corpse, it's a cadaver, it's long since passed. But I actually thought there was reporting, including perhaps from you, that indicated there's been a bit of an uptick in advertising revenue over there at X.  Yeah, we talked about this a few months ago and it came up again this week. So way back in February, I wrote this newsletter that essentially said, hey, we're seeing an uptick in advertising. Elon Musk is out here saying the quote unquote ad boycott is essentially over or soon to be over. Like what gives, right? And what I heard and what I put in this newsletter was essentially that everyone in the ad industry is terrified of not advertising on X.  Because at the time, the owner of the company was BFF with the President of the United States and they were suing people who didn't advertise there, right? So there was this implicit sort of idea that, hey, if we don't spend money on X, we are going to be sued.  It has been talked about for several months. The couple days, maybe a day before the conference started last week, the Wall Street Journal had a more detailed version of that story that said the lawyers for X are literally calling some of these advertisers and making this threat explicit, right? You advertise with us or we will sue you. And that the legal argument is, Kurt, the legal argument is what  What's the legal argument? Well, I'm not an antitrust lawyer. The claim is that this is anti-competitive and that these brands are sort of colluding to damage X's business. Now, I have never really heard of a boycott being considered anti-competitive, anti-trust, right? I mean, think about how people vote with their wallets all day, every day, right? And there's never been any kind of sort of  to my knowledge, like push back on this from a legality standpoint. When you think about what Elon in particular and Linda really have said about free speech, it's quite comical to think that, you know, hey, spend money on our product or we will sue you. Oh, by the way, we're free speech absolutists, right? To me, those things do not really go hand in hand.  But again, on the eve of this conference, essentially, this story comes out that paints X in quite a negative light. Again, it's not totally new. We've been talking about this for months. But it did set a stage, I would say, for discussions around X at the event. And a bunch of people that I talked to last week pointed out, like, this is pretty shady stuff if this is indeed what's happening to people.  Yeah, I mean, Max, I guess I don't understand if they are doing this and they're allowed to do this, I guess I just don't know where it ends. Like, to me, then I suppose the hot dog vendor at the street is, you know, his sales pitch is, buy this hot dog or I'll punch you in the face. The guy selling shovels says, buy this shovel or I will beat you with it.  I mean, it's pretty darn odd, like, and I don't, well, I guess if it's working in the short term, I suppose, God bless him, but man, it doesn't seem like it. Is it working? I mean, the thing that Kurt said that he's got reporting that says revenue is ticking back up. Yeah. I just, again, like you sort of would wonder if we're seeing maybe token purchases, small purchases to deal with.  the threat rather than... Well, let's ask Kurt that. Would token purchases of ads be enough to drive that pickup in ad revenue that you talked about?  Yes, at scale, because remember, the numbers are quite small, right? I mean, this is not like a $100 billion annual revenue company where someone spending 10 million bucks gets totally lost in the sauce. It's like they're making $2.5 billion in annual revenue. So if suddenly you have  you know, a dozen advertisers that have all, you know, spending 10 million plus dollars or whatever it is, that's going to actually be a notable, noticeable jump in revenue, small but noticeable. So I do think the token thing is sort of real. And if you are a giant advertiser, you have to weigh like, is $10 million worth  sort of the public drama of being sued by X and going through a multi-year lawsuit. And I think a lot of brands would just say, no, you just give them the money and run the ad. But is this a sustainable thing? Right. Like to Max's point, like, OK, maybe there's an uptick this year, but like this is not the sign of a healthy business when you have to force your clients to spend with you at risk of lawsuit.  Okay, Kurt, so CEO Linda Iaccarino sat down with an Axios reporter for a panel there at Cannes, and it got a little sporty. Tell us briefly about it. Well, we talked about that story that came out, and so Linda was asked about this on stage, I believe it was on Monday of Cannes, so the very first day of the conference.  And essentially, instead of, you know, either acknowledging, yes, we are doing this or even disputing it, the the real feedback was like she trashed the Wall Street Journal, you know, and was like, does anyone still read that publication?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1563.503, "text": "Right."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 37, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1563.904, "text": "And the whole notion. And you guys are familiar with this because you cover Elon and have paid attention to Elon for years. But like this is a pretty tried and true strategy from sort of Elon Musk as well. Right. Which is like someone writes something that  that he doesn't like or in this case she doesn't like and the response is well i'm just going to bash the journalism i'm going to bash that outlet and those reporters and sort of cast doubt on the story that way and so that's what we saw but it was a kind of a an awkward way to start the week right everyone's there to potentially do these deals and and and perhaps give x  big checks for money for ads. But instead of starting that way, it really started with this sort of combative conversation with Linda. And it did come up several times throughout my discussions that week as just sort of like, it wasn't really a great look for her or X on the eve or the beginning of this important conference. Bit of a buzzkill.  The other thing I'm thinking about as Kurt is talking about this, we talked last week about cash burn at XAI. I think a billion dollars a month was the figure that we had from our reporting. I mean, there's a lot of  cash going out of this combined company, and it sounds like... Well, but for X, it's mostly just going to be for the debt, right? I mean, they've sacked a huge chunk of their workforce, right? I mean, yeah, you're right. They are bleeding money. I'm just saying there's not that much revenue coming into this operation, either from the AI side or from the advertising side.  Yeah, I mean, that fundraise, apparently, which they are still doing right now for XAI, of which X is now a unit, apparently came a touch too late for the big con party. Had that money come in, you know, they would have, you know, that's where Kurt would have been hanging out on Thursday night. Diplo would have been doing a double.  Okay. Now, uh, Curt, don't hang up. Don't leave us, but I got a couple of quick things, rapid fire for Max. And if you have some clever thoughts, some epiphany, sir, weigh in and shout it out. Max, there was another exploding rocket. Yeah.  Over the weekend, a Starship rocket doing a static fire test. That's a kind of test where they fire the engine while it's on the ground. It exploded. I think in the statement, SpaceX called it like a significant anomaly or something like that. But yes, it was a bad... They say the darndest things. You got to give them credit. They have  Rocket engineer speak is funny, right? Anyway, this was bad. This was not something they expected. I mean, especially and it's bad because they just keep happening one after the after another. This is like the third or fourth. Yeah, I think maybe the fourth in a row where we've had it not go exactly right. If Lauren Grush, you know, our colleague and Bloomberg aerospace reporter were here, she just got Kurt.  She would say that, look, these are experimental crafts. Explosions are not totally uncommon or necessarily even unexpected. Sorry, wasn't it, and maybe you already said this, but wasn't it simply refueling? It was a fuel mishap. There was an explosion while they were loading fuel in. Yeah, definitely not supposed to happen. And they're investigating it. And I do think  While these are experimental craft, each time something like this happens, it pushes the timeline back a little bit. And this is a company that is very much under the gun if they want to meet Elon Musk's very, very aggressive timelines for sending these rockets towards Mars or even putting them to tests  that could lead them to go to Mars. So definitely a setback on top of the issues that we've talked about for the last few weeks with Trump and the former NASA appointee. Now, we also had a revelation of sorts on Musk's computer situation.  Yeah, this is where I want Kurt's input here because a lot of people were surprised that in the legal filings between OpenAI and Elon Musk in the dispute between Sam Altman and Elon Musk, OpenAI and Elon Musk, Elon's team essentially said he does not have a computer and that like the OpenAI had been expecting  you know, emails or documents from his computer. I guess they got some from his phone, but his lawyer said no computer. And a lot of people are surprised by this. And my reaction, Kurt, was, is it really that surprising? I feel like Elon's not the only CEO who goes or claims to go without a computer.  Yeah, I'm not. I actually wasn't surprised at that at all for the same reason, Max. I remember in the book I wrote, Battle for the Bird, by the way. Buy it, read it. Yeah, buy it, read it, please. Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, did his entire job from his smartphone. You know what I mean? He had an iPad that he used from time to time. But really, I mean, like this is a guy running. That's funny. That's like very, you know, elderly, I don't know, or child of him or something. Yeah.  But I mean, like this guy wasn't just running Twitter, he was running Square, now Block at the same time. So a CEO of two publicly traded tech companies who did his entire job from his phone, right? And so, I mean, it's hard for me to imagine Elon sitting down at his laptop and typing away. I think we know he did because he's posted some screenshots of a laptop at one point that the only reason I remember is they were like really smudgy and gross and everyone was like, ooh, your screen looks really gross, you need to clean it.  So I do remember some of that, but no, I'm not surprised to hear he works from a phone. I suspect that laptop is his gaming piece. Like he does play a lot of computer games. But yeah, like these guys have assistants and stuff as well. Like what would you need a computer for if you're Elon Musk? He's got, um, he's got what's what the hell is the name of his robot? He's got Optimus. Optimus. Yeah, he's got like he's got a whole flock of Optimi around him that you're just at his beck and call.  I would be surprising if you saw Elon typing away at a laptop, I'd say, unless he was playing a computer game or composing a meme. Kurt Wagner, thanks as always. Max, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Yes, good afternoon. And we have just concluded the formal part of the NATO Summit in The Hague. Of course, there will be many other meetings later today, this afternoon. And together, Allies have laid the foundations for a stronger, fairer, and more lethal NATO.  NATO leaders agreed on the The Hague Defence Investment Plan. This will fuel a quantum leap in our collective defence. They agreed to boost our defence industries, which will not only increase our security, but will also create jobs. And we have reaffirmed our unwavering support for Ukraine.  All of this is crucial. It means that no matter the challenges we face, whether from Russia or terrorism, cyber attacks, sabotage or strategic competition, this Alliance is and will remain ready, willing and able to defend every inch of Allied territory and ensure that our one billion people can continue to live in freedom and security.  These decisions will have a profound impact on our ability to do what NATO was founded to do, deter and defend. And the key decision in that regard is to adopt the The Hague Defence Investment Plan. With this plan, Allies have agreed to invest 5% of GDP in defence. This is a significant commitment in response to significant threats to our security.  It includes at least 3.5% of GDP invested in core defence requirements, a benchmark that until today was set at 2%. A target that I am pleased to say all Allies will now meet this year or have already met. The 3.5% is to fund our militaries and the equipment they need, from our air defences to ammunition, drones, tanks, troops and more.  In addition to the 3.5 percent for core defense, the plan includes 1.5 percent of GDP that will go towards investments that support our defense and security. All to ensure we can effectively deter aggression and defend ourselves and each other should anyone make the mistake of attacking. Allies recognize the severity of the threats we face.  And in response, they have come together to agree an ambitious but essential new defence spending commitment. Our decisions today show, from the Mediterranean to the Arctic, from the west coast of North America to our eastern flank, all Allies are united in understanding that we need to step up to stay safe. And they are acting on it. President Trump has been clear.  America is committed to NATO. He affirmed that again today in no uncertain terms. At the same time, he made clear that America expects European allies and Canada to contribute more. And that is exactly what we see them doing. European allies and Canada will do more of the heavy lifting, equalizing their spending and taking greater responsibility for our shared security.  Of course, work does not stop here. This is day one. We now shift from agreeing on what we need to rolling up our sleeves and making this new plan a reality. And part of this requires that we rapidly expand our defence industrial capacity on both sides of the Atlantic. We need quality and quantity. We need to innovate and we need to act fast.  So we will continue our work to bring down barriers. We will leverage our partnerships with the European Union, with Ukraine and in the Inner Pacific to foster defence industrial cooperation. And there are major economic benefits, with the potential for literally millions of extra jobs across the Alliance. The decisions made today will make NATO much stronger.  They also make NATO a fairer alliance, with Europe and Canada stepping up and carrying their fair share of the responsibility for our shared security. The resolve of Allies is clear. We are in this together. Committed to Article 5. And we are determined to stand firm. No one should doubt our capacity or determination should our security be challenged.  This is the stronger, fairer, and more lethal alliance that NATO leaders have begun to build. Of course, this is also an alliance that stands firmly by our neighbour and partner, Ukraine. My dear friend Volodymyr Zelensky is here in The Hague with us at the NATO Summit along with his team. Our resounding message to him and the Ukrainian people is that Ukraine has our continued support.  including with over 35 billion euros pledged so far this year with more to follow. All of this, our aim is to keep Ukraine in the fight today so that it can enjoy a lasting peace in the future. We stand by Ukraine in its pursuit of peace and will continue to support Ukraine on its irreversible path to NATO membership. It has been a momentous meeting today  Leaders have agreed on a trajectory that will ensure we are able to safeguard our freedom and security well into the future. And with that, I'm happy to take your questions. MODERATOR All right. I will call on people, and please, if you could, state the outlet you're from, if I don't know that already."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 651.913, "text": "We'll start with Sky News.

No, I don't think so. I think it's a bit of a question of taste. But I think he's a good friend. And when he is doing stuff which is forcing us to, for example, when it comes to making more investments, I mean, would you ever think that this would be the result of this summit if he would not have been re-elected president? Do you really think that seven or eight countries who said, yeah, somewhere in the 2030s, we might meet the 2%? We've now all decided in the last four or five months to get to 2%.  So doesn't he deserve some praise?

Well, there are two issues to this and to the 5%. One is that there is this consistent ask from the U.S. \u2013 this started already with Eisenhower in the 1950s \u2013 for the Europeans and the Canadians to equalize with what the U.S. is spending. And now, finally, we are going to do that. But obviously, the 3.5 core spending and the total 5% is deeply rooted in the outcome of a process in NATO, the NATO defense planning process,  which has led to agreeing by the defense ministers two weeks ago on our targets. So what each country needs to do, when the call would come, if the call would come, we need you to help because there is an Article 5 situation. And we have calculated that to basically reach those targets, we need to spend 3.5% on core defense and of course the 1.5% on defense and security-related spending.  There is this U.S. request, please equalize, because it is not fair that we shoulder much more than the others are doing and that we are carrying more weight than the others are doing. And there is the issue of that it is really necessary because of the long-term threat by the Russians to the whole of the Euro-Atlantic area and also the other upcoming adversaries and, of course, the situation with China, where we see this  Impressive military buildup, so it is both true the u.s. Has consistently had this request now for 60 70 years finally we will do it and I think Important it makes the whole of the alliance more stable and fair and it is the need because of Russia and others All right the woman in the third row over on the left side here I  Secretary General, you have stated that this year Canadians and Europeans have pledged $35 billion into military support to Ukraine, and this is not even the half of the year."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1044.107, "text": "In your opinion, what should be the expenditure for Ukraine at the end of the year?

So I'm positive about that, optimistic, but I'm not going to make a concrete prediction. But let's, I mean, we can safely assume that the end result will be positive.  And of course, what we are doing here, we have to make sure that Ukraine can stay in the fight, that Ukraine has what it needs to be as strong as possible. But obviously, we are all also working on getting a peace deal done or a long-term ceasefire done. And then we have to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs.  to prevent Vladimir Putin from ever, ever trying this again in the future. And the first layer of that, making sure that Ukraine can defend itself post a peace deal slash a long-term ceasefire, obviously is also the support we are now providing to keep them in the fight  which has to do, of course, with training, it has to do with delivering military equipment, sort of commanding Wiesbaden, but also the various streams of money going into Ukraine, developing Ukrainians' defence industrial base, which still has about a 35 billion spare capacity.

But at the same time, and this is what we have been hearing open source from many senior military leaders in Europe, including the chief of defense in Germany, they are building up their armed forces and reconstituting their armed forces at such a pace  that they could be ready in three, five or seven years to attack NATO. And that is why today is so important and today is so transformational. Yes, to the question before, because we have to equalize this U.S. and end the debate which has now been running for 60, 70 years. But particularly also because we know that there is this Russia threat, short term, long term, whatever, but the Russia threat is there and we have to make sure that we can defend ourselves. And that is why we are doing this.  Okay, we just have time for a few more questions.

I had yesterday an excellent meeting with the Japanese foreign minister. We will have a meeting with the senior leaders from the inner Pacific four countries later today, and there will be another meeting also with President Zelensky and European leaders. But with the inner Pacific four, we will also meet. And this is because we know that our two  area, so the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific are getting more and more connected. Look at North Korea being so closely involved now in the war effort, and North Korean soldiers fighting on European soil on the Russian side against Ukraine. That is rather historic. So this cooperation is important, where it's very much focused on innovation, it's very much focused on procurement, on defense industrial production.  making joint assessments of what is happening in the Pacific, what is happening in the New Atlantic, and how the two are  more and more interconnected. And I must say, when I'm speaking to the leaders, and I was visiting Japan early April, having a long meeting with the Prime Minister, and I met him again last week in Calgary at the G7, but also the leaders of the Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, they all are very much aware that, of course, part of having a deterrence is that you spend enough on it. And you see in all these countries, debates ongoing on  doing more where possible, but it is not up to me to advise them. Let me concentrate on the 32 and make sure that we do what we need to do.

I'm from the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. Did you exchange views on Vladimir Putin? Mr. Trump seems to be in rather friendly terms with him. It would be interesting to hear what you talked about him."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1726.799, "text": " I've not changed my views on Vladimir Putin. I don't trust the guy and of course I had a lot of dealings with him personally when we had the terrible situation with flight MH17, the Malaysian airline flight MH17 being shot out of the air by Russia in July 2014. And Putin telling me that he was not present in the Donbass and that he had no dealings in Ukraine and this, that and the other. And this was, these were all lies. We know that.  Okay, for the sake of geographical diversity, all the way in the back, Telegraaf. I have two short questions for you, right here at the back. How do you think Vladimir Putin will look at this NATO summit in The Hague and the appointments being made between the eight NATO allies? The other question, completely different one, but how do you think  How big is the role of the Dutch King, Willem-Alexander, the Queen and also Amalia in organizing this NATO Summit and making it into a success? A big role. Last night was really amazing.  We are both Dutch and we can be very fortunate to have this royal family. Of course, they have that overview which many politicians who are there for one or two terms can never compete with. So we have a king here in the Netherlands who is now in that position for 12 years. And you sense that. I mean, the breadth, the benefits from which he is speaking.  including with the American president and other leaders, is really impressive. And I've seen the same before with his mother, Queen Beatrix. So that is one of the huge advantages of having a monarchy. And I would say, well, to your and my country, let's be happy and let's be glad and grateful that this family is willing to do that. On the other question, I mean, look what Putin achieved. He wanted to divide the West. And now Finland and Sweden have joined NATO.  He wanted to divide the West, and now we have committed to a 5% spending target. So he cannot be very happy. And he should not be very happy.  Thank you very much for this opportunity. So for the West Balkans, for the first time in a long time it hasn't been mentioned in the communique. What does it mean for our region? You yourself were several times talking about the importance of the region for the alliance. Why can't you tell us why it's not mentioned?  But again, this is not your traditional communique which you would see in the UN or in NATO in the past where you would have 60 pages, 90 paragraphs basically talking about the world from the birth of Jesus up to today and everything in between. I mean, that's dumb.  We try to focus \u2013 so we are still very much concerned. KFOR is there in Kosovo. EUFOR is there in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I was visiting the region, had extensive talks with the leadership in Bosnia, in Kosovo. I had a dinner in Brussels with the president of Serbia. So we are very much involved as NATO. The EU, of course, is very much involved. We closely coordinate with Caracalla and Ursula von der Leyen on the European side.  But what we really want to do here is not to recall all the language, like the irreversible path of Ukraine into NATO. It's still there, nothing changed. But really to focus on three core issues in five paragraphs. And one of the paragraphs is about the next meeting. So basically four paragraphs. And that is about, as you know, production, spending, and Ukraine. Okay, final question to the young reporters in the front. Yes.  We'll get a mic to you, just a moment. Thank you very much for this opportunity, Secretary General. We are the youth correspondents. Absolutely. And you are here now for two days and you'll be marvelous.  There's a lot happening in this world and many children worry about it. Do you think we children can also fight for peace or should we trust that you could bring peace to the world? Thank you. I cannot personally bring peace to the world, but what we can do collectively  is to make sure that we are so well prepared, we are so strong that nobody will ever attack us. So the best way to preserve your future and that our children can live in a democratic, free, open society where you can be who you want to be, think what you want, have free press,  What we basically have in the West, and let's be honest, it's fantastic, is to make sure that we spend enough on our defence, particularly if we know that we have some adversaries who are really trying to get at us. So that's the best way to preserve your future. That's what we try to do today, to make that commitment.  But you standing here is really touching. And we have seen each other for two days. We know each other for a longer time. I really want to thank you both. And in you, all the free press sitting in this room, for your fantastic work. And see you soon, in Brussels or elsewhere.

But the investment pledge includes a review of spending in 2029 to monitor progress and reassess the security threat posed by Russia.  The leaders also underlined their ironclad commitment to NATO's collective security guarantee, saying, quote, that an attack on one is an attack on all. Ahead of the summit, President Trump had again raised doubts over whether the United States would defend its allies. But there we did just want to bring that breaking news again, heading back out to this post from the AP, that NATO leaders have agreed on a massive hike in defense spending after that pressure from the US president.

So I'm positive about that, optimistic, but I'm not going to make a concrete prediction. But let's, I mean, we can safely assume that the end result will be positive.  And of course what we are doing here, we have to make sure that Ukraine can stay in the fight, that Ukraine has what it needs to be as strong as possible.

And then we have to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs.  to prevent Vladimir Putin from ever trying this again in the future. And the first layer of that, making sure that Ukraine can defend itself post the peace deal slash a long-term ceasefire, obviously is also the support we are now providing to keep them in the fight  which has to do of course with training, it has to do with delivery of military equipment, sort of commanding Wiesbaden, but also the various streams of money going into Ukraine, developing Ukrainians defence industrial base, which still has about 35 billion spare capacity.

We meet at a dangerous moment for our one billion citizens.  Russia's war against Ukraine rages on. An assertive grouping of adversaries seeks to divide and challenge us. There's war in the Middle East. Terrorism poses a persistent threat. And new technologies bring opportunities, but also many serious security challenges. In the face of this, we stand together, united in NATO, the most powerful defensive alliance in world history.  History has shown that North America and Europe working together is a winning combination. Our adversaries know this. Our enduring commitment to Article 5, that an attack on one is an attack on all, sends a powerful message. In this meeting, we will take historic, transformational decisions to make our people safer through a stronger, fairer, and more lethal NATO.  To make NATO stronger, we have a concrete plan for all Allies to spend 5% of GDP on defence. It will go towards core defence, as well as defence and security-related investments. This decision is deeply rooted in our core mission and is required to resource our plans and readiness. This will also make NATO fairer, to ensure anyone and everyone contributes their fair share for our security.  For too long, one ally, the United States, carried too much of the burden of that commitment. And that changes today. President Trump, dear Donald, you made this change possible. Your leadership on this has already produced one trillion dollars in extra spending from European allies since 2016.  And the decisions today will produce trillions more for our common defense to make us stronger and fairer by equalizing spending between America and America's allies. Allies will also agree to further increase defense production so that our armed forces have everything they need. That means a huge expansion of our defense industrial base on both sides of the Atlantic.  That's good for our security, it's good for our economies and good for our jobs. Our decisions include continuing our support to Ukraine, while also pushing for a just and lasting peace. We all want the bloodshed to stop. We call on Russia to end its aggression against Ukraine.  Let me now turn to Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Dick Schoof, whose government and people are graciously hosting us here. Thank you to the media for joining us.

I'm convinced that after today, the Hague will also be known as a city of collective purpose, unity, and resolve. After all, we are about to write history.  We are about to make decisions leading to an unprecedented increase in our collective defense spending and a new financial balance in our alliance. Both are urgent, both are necessary, and both will help make our transatlantic bond even stronger, so we can do justice to our founding principles of democracy, liberty, and the rule of law, as laid down in the Washington Treaty.  The last NATO event held in The Hague was a foreign minister meeting in 1989, just as Iron Curtain was beginning to break apart on the eve of the Cold War's end. And for a period, we hoped and believed that relations with Russia would continue to thaw. But the end of history turned out to be an illusion. An illusion that was shattered for good when Russia brutally invaded Ukraine.  So today there is a renewed awareness in our ranks that peace cannot be taken for granted. That it must be protected constantly and with conviction. And yes, peace comes at a cost. We must act on this swiftly and decisively.

I'm here today to speak in favor of my bill, the Special Interest Alien Reporting Act of 2025, an essential piece of border security transparency legislation. My bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to publicly release monthly reports on the number of special interest aliens  encountered, their countries of origin, and where they were encountered. A special interest alien, or SIA, is a non-U.S. person who, based on a DHS analysis of travel patterns, may pose a national security risk to the United States or its interests.  Currently, DHS does not report on this data. Instead, we have been left only with random, incomplete announcements of moment-in-time numbers by DHS officials or leaks to the media. The Biden-Harris administration's disastrous policies place the United States in an extremely vulnerable national security position. Over the past four years, Customs and Border Protection faced  an unprecedented number of special interest aliens from 26 countries that the Department of Homeland Security has determined pose the greatest national security and counterintelligence threats. Those encountered included individuals from adversarial nations, including the People's Republic of China,  Iran, Afghanistan, and Syria. The Biden-Harris administration intentional disregard for our laws and breakdown of national security resulted in U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountering over 1.7 million special interest aliens, a staggering number. Many of these individuals were swiftly processed and released into the interior under the Biden-Harris administration's catch and release policies.  Given ongoing events in the Middle East, this legislation is essential for Congress to conduct congressional oversight of the executive branch. Given the fact that we have been warned of a potential attack on our homeland by Iran or their terrorist proxies mean that American people should have transparency of special interest aliens coming across our border or who did come across our border the last four years.  During the Biden-Harris administration, the Border Patrol apprehended over 1,500 Iranian nationals illegally crossing the southwest border between ports of entry. Of those, Biden and Harris admitted 729\u2014that's almost half of those from Iran\u2014into the United States. And we have no idea how many are still at large today. And guess what?  We only just now are getting that number because CBP just disclosed it to Fox News, Bill Mlugen, who posted it on his social media. That's not how this should work. With Iran threatening Americans with retaliatory attacks on our homeland, President Biden and Vice President Harris, his border czar, created an opportunity for our adversaries to gain access  to our nation and wreak havoc when called upon. The Biden-Harris administration welcomed these potential national security risks into our country, including through illegal parole programs they started, such as the CBP-1 app, to facilitate their quick release into the United States. Parents don't let bad guys or potentially bad guys into their homes with their children. These people should have never been released into our country.  Under Biden and Harris, our sovereign borders became revolving doors for illegal aliens, including an untold number of bad actors intent on causing mayhem and harm to innocent people. CBP already publicly reports statistics relating to individuals on the terrorist screening data set who attempt to illegally cross our borders, but they do not release statistics on special interest aliens. The American people deserve to see the data.  Similar to the information on the terrorist screening data set, releasing encounter statistics on special interest aliens would not include sensitive information, but general encounter information, which increases the transparency and accountability that are critical to the health of our constitutional republican.  After all, it's the American people that pay for the government because they're the taxpayers. They deserve to know. The legislation would show the American people the contrast between open borders and secure borders. It would require DHS to publish the monthly SIA numbers going all the way back to early 2021 when Biden and Harris took office. They will also provide Congress with necessary context to conduct oversight of future administrations.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important piece of legislation to increase our national security and transparency for the American people, whom we all swore an oath to serve and protect. Thank you, and I yield back."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 335.576, "text": "The gentlelady yields back.

Chairwoman Fox and Ranking Member McGovern and members of the committee,  Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Tipping Off Terrorist Act. Although well-intentioned, this bill compromises national security. It's the bottom line. This bill requires Customs and Border Protection, CBP, to publish sensitive data on national security information on a monthly basis, essentially giving the bad guys information to do a better job of penetrating our defenses.  But let's look at the big picture. Special Interest Alien, or SIA, just means that someone's travel patterns indicate a need for further scrutiny. It does not mean someone's a terrorist or out to do harm at all. During their committee markup, my colleagues on the Republican side claimed that this bill only required CBP to publish the total number of SIAs that are encountered while trying to enter the country illegally.  If that were the case, I would support this legislation. But that is not the case. Greater transparency and accountability, Department of Homeland Security is important. Public needs it, but it should not be done at the expense of compromising our national security, which is exactly what this bill does. As the bill reads, it would also require CBP to publicly identify  each SIA nationality, country of last residence, and the geographic location that the encounter was made, and whether the encounter was made at a port of entry or in the interior of the United States. By publishing this information in real time, bad actors will be able to tell who is getting advanced screening from CBP and which locations have been most successful in interdicting these immigrants. The bad guys will use this information  to adjust their operations to try and avoid extra screening, which only hurts our national security. And please note that DHS has never publicly released these numbers on a real-time basis because the numbers could give away sensitive information. And please note today, there is nothing to stop DHS or Secretary Nome from publishing these numbers. Instead of  addressing this bill on the floor. I asked the author of this legislation to work with DHS to get such information published or made available to the public in a way that DHS considers safe. I would ask the author of this bill to talk to the Secretary of Homeland Security and come up with a structure to publish this information that DHS would not deem harmful to our national security."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 521.333, "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chair."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 546.595, "text": " What my bill would do is provide transparency for the American people on the DHS website.

I now recognize Mr. Scott for his time of question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Congresswoman Green, I want you to know I was at the border the 15th, 16th, and 17th, and Department of Homeland Security has this information.  They told me exactly how many countries they had intercepted people from and exactly how many people were paroled in the country. And I'll go back to what the chair just said. Laws transition administrations. And the one thing the Biden administration would have never done is to publish the information about how many people were being allowed into this country from  from other places where we know they are harboring terrorists. And so the Democrats want people to believe that all of the immigration is from the Western Hemisphere. That's just not true. It's coming from a lot of places, places like Iran, places like Afghanistan, places like Pakistan. There are a lot of people that are spending a lot of money  Now, you have to spend a lot of money to fly across the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean to get to the Western Hemisphere. So they're transiting the oceans, and then they're making their way up, and the ones we catch, they were paroling or allowing to go free in our country. I hope that the Secretary will publish it if this law passes or not, and I hope the law passes because I hope whoever the next Secretary is  will have to publish it. I think we should keep a running total from every country of how many people are illegally released into our country. And I'll tell you this, if the general public knew how many people and from what countries they had been released into this country from, Donald Trump would have probably gotten more votes than he got in the last presidential election. So I commend you for your  your legislation. I intend to vote for it. And, you know, I do hope that the Secretary will go ahead and publish this, whether this law passes or not, because the American citizens need to know who has been released into this country, or at least where they came from.

Correa points out that DHS has expertise in determining what information can be safely published and argues that the committee should defer to their judgement.

And every one of those tomahawks hit within a foot of where they were supposed to hit, took out a lot of buildings that Israel wasn't able to get. We took them out with tomahawks. We don't even talk about that. This was a devastating attack, and it knocked them for a loop. And, you know, if it didn't, they wouldn't have settled.

He said there was Iran the way it looked the day before the attack.  and what their nuclear program looks like now, two very different things. They are way behind where they were just seven days ago. Now, anything in the world can be rebuilt, but now we know where it is, and if they try to rebuild it, we'll have options there as well.

He will appear before the Senate Banking Committee. Yesterday at House Financial Services, Chairman Powell said he is still in no rush to cut interest rates while the central bank waits to see how tariffs affect the economy. Increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity. The effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level.

And that process is repeated.  until a candidate receives a majority. It's time now for a look at some of the other stories making news in New York and around the world. And for that, we're joined by Bloomberg's Michael Barr. Michael, good morning. Good morning, Karen. There's a bit of relief ahead today from the extreme heat gripping much of the country. Parts of the Midwest will see cooler temperatures, but it will be another brutally hot day in the Northeast. Bloomberg meteorologist Rob Carolin has the latest.  Michael, high pressure will continue to produce hot weather today, just not the excesses of we saw yesterday. We had temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in the New York City area in Washington in the Boston area. In fact, Boston has set their all time record high yesterday for June at 102, fourth warmest day there in southern New England. Looks like the high is beginning to weaken, so temperatures are hot today but not as hot as yesterday. We have heat advisories in effect from parts of southern New England through the New York City area all the way down into the mid Atlantic states. Good news is the northeast will be much cooler tomorrow, Michael.  Thank you very much, Rob. Court resumes today in the sex trafficking case against music mogul Sean Diddy Combs when his attorneys have a sit-down with the judge on jury instructions. Both the defense and the prosecution rested their cases. After closing arguments, deliberations could begin as soon as Friday.  The NTSB criticizing Boeing, its subcontractors, Spirit Aerosystems, and the FAA for that terrifying Alaska Airlines flight when a door plug flew off in mid-flight. Miraculously, all 177 people on board survived.  The NTSB preliminary report revealing Boeing employees felt pressure to work too fast, making it difficult to avoid mistakes. NTSB Chair Jennifer Hominy credits the fast-acting crew of Alaska Flight 1282.  An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures. And yet the crew shouldn't have had to be heroes. Because this accident never should have happened. NTSB Chair Jennifer Hominy says the finalized report will be available in several weeks.

Yeah, you know, I think this was the real strategy behind Mamdani linking arms with other candidates and making sure that people cross-endorsed and making sure that other people ranked him on their ballot. Say he wasn't their first choice, maybe he was their second, and this really worked.  Imam Dhani is a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist Assembly member from Queens, and he's now on track to become the Democratic nominee for mayor. He won 43.5% of the first-choice votes, to Andrew Cuomo's 36.3%. And while we're still waiting for the final ranked-choice results, which will be released on July 1st,  You know, Cuomo conceded last night to this primary, which tells you everything you need to know about how this is really going to end. Mamdani pulled this off with a combination of message, movement, and method. He ran on affordability, freezing rents, free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and connected with young voters, immigrant communities, and the city's growing progressive base. His campaign had 50,000 volunteers. Nathan, I'll tell you this.  You know, there was a day that I went with my wife and son and my brother-in-law and his kids to, you know, a local bar in Brooklyn. And there were people there doing outreach for Mondani. And this was months before the primary. And that told me what I needed to know, which was that he had already created this big coalition"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 24, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 874.004, "text": " Miles, you were just talking about the grassroots reach that Mamdani had in the final stretch of this.

You're talking about him being endorsed by AOC, Bernie Sanders, and then him also getting some support from Democratic establishment candidates. That cross endorsement with the Working Families Party  where Tish James stood on that stage with the person she primarily endorsed and said, rank this slate, that played a big role. But there is also a push in New York City for folks to have affordability. They did not feel that Andrew Cuomo's comeback would get them to that place. Cuomo had money, $25 million in Super PAC money, but he was extremely negative in his ads. There were some ads that really stoked at fears of New Yorkers.  There was a push to call Mamdani an anti-Semite when he's always said for years and for the months of this campaign that he is not an anti-Semite, he just is pro-Palestine and he does want to work with  with Jewish New Yorkers and have a New York that makes them feel safe. But he offered something different. Urgency, optimism and a break from the old guard. And Cuomo still carried the weight of unresolved scandals. His resignation, the nursing home deaths, allegations of sexual harassment and questions about transparency during COVID.  And it's clear that voters didn't forget. They said, let's go with this new guy, even though he's only passed three bills in the legislature, even though he only has a staff of five. Let's see if this is a guy who gets forward.

So, you know, I've been covering this story with Laura Lamias, who's our senior reporter covering New York. And we talked about this a couple of days ago. You know, is Cuomo too embarrassed to have, you know, on July 1st, if he's if he's truly lost a Democratic primary, is he too embarrassed to run on that independent line because he didn't get the support of Democrats?  and this is a guy who has been an establishment Democrat over the last 30 years. He's on the independent line, but last night he signaled that he might not use it. He told reporters last night, tonight was not our night. Does that mean that it's not our night? Is it a firm no? We don't know. It's a big shift from the assumption that he was gonna keep going no matter what. But this now tells me that this is going to be a race between Eric Adams, who is still mayor, and Zoran Mamdani.  Adams, of course, skipped a Democratic primary entirely, planning to run on that stop antisemitism line. It gives him a second shot and he's politically vulnerable, but can he have the groundswell of support in the black community that Cuomo took away? Can he have the groundswell of support from Republicans who seem to like what he's done? And so this could be a two-way race. I think what will happen is that they'll find a way to push Curtis Lewa  off the ballot and give Adams that Republican line, and then will those center-right Democrats, Caribbean folks, the people I grew up with, who may not know Mamdani, go for the name they know, which is Eric Adams.

For more, we're joined by Bloomberg News Senior Editor Bill Ferries. Bill, good morning. What do we know about what this initial Pentagon assessment actually says? Good morning.  Good morning, Nathan. So, yes, there's this initial assessment out from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, and it basically says that that surprise bombing attack by those B-2s over the weekend likely did not cripple Iran's\u2014the core components of Iran's nuclear program that were buried deep  Now, it's clear the entrances have been completely destroyed and covered up, but their initial assessment is that, deep down, those centrifuges may still be there. Iran may be able to dig through the rubble and get back down into those areas.  So obviously that would be a very disappointing outcome for the U.S. President Trump authorized this extremely risky mission with these stealth bombers flying 37 hours around the world to make this, to bomb those sites. And there's still a lot more information that will probably come out, a lot more intelligence assessments that need to be done. But the president and his aides pushing back already on this defense, this Pentagon Intelligence Agency report saying that  that it's clear to them that the sites were destroyed and that Iran's nuclear program is stopped. And to that point, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also at the NATO summit saying that the report was preliminary and low confidence saying that the leak of this assessment is going to be investigated. How is the effort going to get UN nuclear inspectors back in the region now that a ceasefire is in effect?  Well, that's the priority for the International Atomic Energy Agency. They have said that they think the atomic program has been set back significantly, but they wouldn't say whether that means months or years. They want to get in as soon as possible to see what is the status of that enriched uranium. Is it still at one of those sites that got bombed, or can they figure out whether it got moved in the days or weeks before the attack?  The IAEA's priority is just to get boots on the ground, basically, and start seeing what they can learn about the status of that program. Yeah, and I guess it can't really be disputed that Iran is on a back foot following all these developments. What can we expect when it comes to the possibility of further talks around the nuclear program between Iran and the U.S. ?  Well, it does seem that both Iran and Israel were ready to de-escalate at some level. They did both agree to at least that temporary ceasefire. It had a rough start, but it seems to be holding. That may bode well for Iran's willingness to sit down again with the U.S. and Oman, maybe through mediators, but start talking about what they can do to scale back their nuclear program.  You know, those are still going to be difficult negotiations, but it does seem the fact that the ceasefire is holding probably is good news for the negotiating teams.

Seven were not on 2%, some were saying somewhere in the 2030s, now this year.  all of them, including Canada, including Italy, including Belgium, they have all now committed to the 2%.

It's very difficult. It's very dangerous to do. We believe it's all down there.  We had a tremendous victory, a tremendous hit.

When they know we're coming, they're not going to be down in that, you know, 30 stories underground. So, no, I think it was just a tremendous victory for everybody, including Iran. Look, you know, they've got a country.  And they've got oil, and they're very smart people, and they can come back. Israel got hit very hard, especially the last couple of days.

And I think this is important for the whole world.  Then on spending, it's absolutely true. I want to state here, without President Trump, this would not have happened in three stages. When you became president in 2016, 2017,  you force Europeans and Canadians to pay more. At this moment, the result of that phase is one trillion extra aggregate defense spending by the Canadians and the Europeans. Then came phase two, when you became president in January of last year. Phase two is that all the countries not yet on 2% have now committed to the 2%. This is the old goal from Wales in 2014. Seven were not on 2%. Some are saying somewhere in the 2030s, now this year.  All of them, including Canada, including Italy, including Belgium, they have all now committed to the 2%. And now comes the big splash. Today, we will decide to go to 5%. We have to keep ourselves safe from our adversaries, but also because it is fair to equalize with the United States.  With this 5%, the Europeans and the Canadians will equalize their defense spending with the United States. So this is not about American taxpayers paying more. This is about Europeans, Canadians paying more. And again, this would not have happened. I'm really saying this here. And some people might criticize me. But then when I speak with them, they all say, yes, you're right. This would not have happened if you would not have been elected in 2016 and reelected last year and back into office in January."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 151.062, "text": " Thank you very much.

But one thing we know for sure, to all of you Trump foes out there, underestimate him at your own peril.  The mullahs didn't read him right. They thought he was going to balk at intervention. Some Republicans didn't read him right. They thought he was an isolationist. And Democrats didn't read him right. They thought he'd go in half-cocked and start World War III. All of them were wrong. So don't mess with Trump. He'll fight as hard for peace as he does for border enforcement, for tax cuts, and for cutting the bureaucracy.  And he has common sense. And patriotic Americans are on his side. And that's the angle. So how did this ceasefire deal between Iran and Israel actually get negotiated? We know President Trump was directly involved, talking with Bibi Netanyahu, while Vance, Rubio, and my next guest talked with the Iranians.  Donald Trump said he expected the ceasefire to last forever, then both sides violated it. Iran broke the truce first, and then Israel hit back. Trump found out about it right before he left for Holland, and he wasn't even this mad after he got shot.  When I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because of one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. I'm not happy about that. We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing. Do you understand that?  On Air Force One, he dialed Netanyahu and barked at him. Sources say Trump was really angry, told him to knock it off. Unlike Biden, when Trump says don't, people listen, and the ceasefires held since then. Iran's at its weakest point since the 80s, and Israel just cleaned out their whole neighborhood, and they should probably take the win. The question is, does Israel disobey Trump and assassinate the Ayatollah? Does he get couped, or does he remain in power?  Do you want to see regime change in Iran? No. If there was, there was. But no, I don't want it. I'd like to see everything calm down as quickly as possible. Regime change takes chaos. And ideally, we don't want to see so much chaos. Iran's being strangled by sanctions, their currency's out of control, and they're running out of missiles.

Our allies are listening to us and our enemies are scared of us.  The president's heading into July 4th weekend with political clout, peace, a hot stock market, and low energy prices. As Buck Sexton said last night, the trend is our friend. President Trump means what he says. Just listen to his words. He's not that hard to figure out.  You can call it the Trump Doctrine if you want, but it is simply a fact. And despite all the smears from the state-run legacy media mob, Trump has always called for global peace. Sometimes that means you got to get tough with both your enemies and your friends. Take a look earlier today.  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land,  I'm not happy about that. You know what? We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing. Do you understand that?  All right, after a tenuous start, the ceasefire is now back on track. Keep in mind, this is a ceasefire less than one week after President Trump obliterated Iran's nuclear program with a massive strike. Take a look at your screen. The strike was a tremendous success, thanks to several bunker-buster bombs that penetrated a mountain and exploded deep underground.  Fordo, their nuclear plant, really no longer exists. We'll get the full assessment in days ahead. Now, there will be a lot of hard work ahead in terms of achieving a lasting peace. That will include checks and balances and measures in place to prevent Iran from ever rebuilding anything nuclear. This should also include Iran's recognition of Israel, and, of course, anywhere, anyplace, anytime inspections, and that would be American inspections.  And of course, a full accounting of all enriched uranium that the Iranians may have moved, that has got to be a part of it as well. My message to Iran, tried to warn you before Donald Trump dropped those bunker busters, if you think you will be clever and you think you'll be able to use your proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah,  Houthi rebels or others to attack Israel, then that war will be back on immediately, and Donald Trump will not come to the rescue and stop Israel this time. He knows that they are acting on orders from you, the Iranian leadership, or whoever's left. From this point forward, Iran's radical leaders, they are committing suicide any and every time they dare attack Israel, either directly or indirectly through their proxies.  But what President Trump has been able to accomplish in the last week is incredible. It is historic. So many presidents talked about it. None of them ever did it. Now, of course, it is driving the Democrats and the media mob, predictably, absolutely crazy. Instead of congratulations, we are seeing condemnation from the left. Insanely, some are even accusing Donald Trump of committing any illegal act.  And even today, 79 Democrats in Congress voted to impeach the president for daring to breach the 1973 War Powers Act, which, as Greg Jarrett points out, quote, it is a notification requirement. And he did notify the leadership on the Democratic side and Republican side in Congress, not a prohibition on the president's right to exert military action. And the president did, in fact, notify those people in Congress he needed to notify, just to be clear.  As Greg Jarrett points out, under Article 2 of the Constitution, the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and that empowers him to direct military operations to deter foreign threats to our national security, without conferring with Jasmine Crockett. Now, this has been well-established over the course of our republic.  No president has ever abided by the War Powers Act, ever. And the act itself even allows presidents a 60-day window to strike at any enemy if they deem necessary. On top of that, after 9-11, Congress  specifically authorized additional powers for a president, granting explicit power to target nations linked to terrorism. That would be Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror. But if Democrats actually disagree with these facts, where then was the outrage? When Joe Biden bombed Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, or when Barack Obama ordered strikes against Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Pakistan, Obama even ordered  a drone strike against a U.S. citizen in Yemen, and yet Democrats then didn't care a whit. In fact, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson all ordered strikes without congressional approval. There's your Hannity history lesson. But Democrats, why let facts get in the way of a great smear campaign against President Trump?  They live, eat, breathe, sleep, hating Trump. If the dog bites, the bee stings, you're feeling sad, blame Trump. If Trump cures cancer, blame him for that, too. They don't like Donald Trump. They don't like that he has emerged as the real, one, true leader of the free world.  Other presidents only made proclamations about Iran and their nuclear program. Donald Trump brought them to their knees. Other presidents politely encouraged NATO members to, you know, take their defense seriously, pay their fair share. Donald Trump got them to start paying their fair share as of today. Other presidents looked the other way.  you know, was piping in oil and gas at lower rates from Russia, you know, funding Putin's war machine, while Donald Trump was calling them out for doing that very thing and then wanting money for defense. And now, by the way, at the NATO meeting that's going on in the Netherlands, Europe's leaders have finally come to the realization that President Trump has been right the entire time about every major issue facing the world.

Tariff, the impact the tariffs are going to have on growth and inflation. So we believe,  Maybe inflation goes up by 30 basis points.

Last week they said we're going to see a little bump up in inflation, it's going to be temporary, and then it's going to come back down. And if growth slips, we're going to be there with two rate cuts this year. They said that last week. The second piece of uncertainty for us was geopolitics. This is what you're referring to over the last 48 hours.  And it's not just geopolitics, Liz, but it's the effect that geopolitics have on oil, which you just pointed out.

Coming up today, an early US intelligence report shows American airstrikes have only had a limited impact on Iran's nuclear program. The EU warns it will impose tariffs on American imports if the White House keeps a baseline levy on its goods.  Plus, struggling to work it out, ChatGPT's appeal to office workers presents a growing problem for its biggest backer, Microsoft. Let's start with a roundup of our top stories.  America's unprecedented airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities had only a limited impact, according to early U.S. intelligence findings. A report by the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency says the bombing likely didn't cripple the core components of Iran's program, including its centrifuges. According to people familiar with the assessments, the U.S. strikes are likely to have set Tehran's plans back by several months to as much as a year.  U.S. President Donald Trump's team dismissed the reports, which cast doubt on his claim that the strikes totally obliterated their targets. White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt posted on X that the intelligence finding of limited impact was flat-out wrong and, quote, a clear attempt to demean President Trump.  Despite the White House's pushback comments, the assessment will likely only intensify calls from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog for renewed inspections of the targeted sites. This as a ceasefire Trump brokered to end the 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran appears to be holding after 24 hours.  Meanwhile, President Trump has cast doubt on NATO's founding principle as he arrived at the military alliance's annual summit here in Europe. Trump was asked by reporters on Air Force One if he was still committed to Article 5 of NATO, which says that allies will come to the aid of a country under armed attack."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 138.296, "text": "It depends on your definition.

And NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte texted the US President to say, quote, Europe is going to pay in a big way, as they should, and it will be your wish.  The European Union has planned retaliatory tariffs if the White House keeps its baseline levies on EU goods. Bloomberg has learned that the European Commission is preparing a list of American imports worth 95 billion euros to tax on top of its existing duties. Officials told Bloomberg they expect certain US tariffs will remain in place even if trade talks go well and the EU will respond to those.  The US has just two weeks left before President Trump's self-imposed pause on tariffs elapses, with only the UK securing any deal on paper so far.  Chinese companies are ramping up shipments to Britain in a sign of how US tariffs are reshaping global trade.

And those are our top stories for you this morning. Right. In the markets, this ceasefire between Israel and Iran seems to be holding. Oil prices are up by 1.2% for Brent crude futures this morning, but we're still trading on the 67 handle, 67.98. So there is relief there. Also, we saw the Nasdaq rising 1.5% on Tuesday, notching up another record high versus February. So we've seen a huge rebound for the Nasdaq, something like 30%.  The S&P 500 also climbed 1.1% yesterday. Stock futures this morning are positive, up 0.2% for the Euro stocks, 50 futures this morning. It's interesting, though, the markets took Powell's testimony the first day of it yesterday as dovish, which  I thought was a little bit strange given that he reiterated this idea of no rush to cut interest rates. But markets did boost bets on a reduction. They're looking at July, it would seem. So, let's see if that changes again today. The other thing to think about too, so European stocks yesterday really rallied 1.1% at the close of the U.S. stocks, 600 lifted by airline stocks. And then just looking at the bond markets, 10-year U.S. yields of 4.3%.  in a moment more on that U.S. intelligence report on the effect of U.S. strikes on Iran, plus the rivalry, the curious rivalry between two artificial intelligence names for the battle for the office, the workplace who's using A.I. at work. A word first, though, on another story that's caught our eye. This morning, dating apps are out, matchmakers are in. I really like this story, it's hilarious. At what point could we have told this story over the past 20 years?  Well, yes, but I think it's the cost of the matchmakers that has surprised me. And also, so this is Bloomberg's Ignacio Gonzalez and Lara Sally have been writing about dating. I did not know that Match Group, which owns Tinder, has been seeing the number of paying clients online decline for eight consecutive quarters. So actually, yes, the apps  are grim, they are becoming less popular. Apparently, match groups, a business isn't expected to return to revenue growth until 2027. But the organizations that are making money and apparently growing are these matchmaking services that cost thousands, if not tens of thousands of pounds slash dollars slash euros.  It just feels like one of those moments where you have sort of a cyclical turn in an industry where all of a sudden dating apps were huge for a certain amount of time and maybe this is the move on to the next phase, people are going back to in-person connections. But a very interesting read from our colleagues talking through, speaking to some of those matchmakers and some of the people that use them and what they expect out of it and whether or not they think it's good value for money. Yeah, well it is if you find it.  Well, that's the point. But then if you don't, are you going to be annoyed that you spent thousands of dollars on a service that didn't yield results? And I suppose what's the science behind it? A really interesting story. We'll put a link to it in our show notes and you'll find it of course on Bloomberg.com and on the Terminal.  Now, there is a ceasefire holding between Israel and Iran, but Bloomberg has learned that U.S. intelligence assessments show only limited impact from U.S. airstrikes on Tehran's nuclear program. This is despite President Trump saying at the weekend that the strikes totally obliterated their targets. Joining us now is Bloomberg's EMEA News Director Roslyn Matheson. Good morning, Ros. What do we actually know about the damage done to Iran's nuclear program? We have  this assessment from the Pentagon and also the IAEA, they clash with President Trump's view. Well that's right, it's actually interesting to see the White House actually criticizing its own intelligence findings because as you say the Defense Intelligence Agency at the Pentagon has found at least an initial assessment is that it's unlikely that the U.S. bombing crippled the core parts of Iran's  nuclear facilities below the ground of course they're deep underground including their centrifuges and on the back of that you've got the IAEA of course the UN energy monitors who've been saying for days it's very unclear what's going on but they doubt that these strikes set back Iran's atomic ambitions significantly you know could it be months could it be years  And of course the question above all is where is this uranium that's enriched already to a 60% level that the IAEA has lost track of. So those bits of evidence in the satellite images that we've got suggest that it's unlikely that significant damage was caused to these  to these sites, of course, the view from the White House is that they've been totally obliterated. And that's the line they're sticking to and in line with the Israelis who have said that a key part of their goal in their own strikes against Israel was to destroy these facilities. And so the question really is, as the dust clears, metaphorically and literally, do we get a better sense  of those facilities, but without enough IAEA monitors on the ground, and there are limited numbers there, it's very hard to verify exactly what's going on.  Ros, this is of course as we're watching for further developments out of the Middle East as well. We've had some comments from the Iranian President Massoud Pazashkian as well talking about the great wounds that were inflicted by the strikes from Israel as well and claiming that Israel's failed to achieve its goals in Iran. The ceasefire 24 hours on does appear to be holding?  It does appear to be holding, although it's very fragile. I mean, even as we saw yesterday, some extraordinary 24 to 48 hours, and we had at least a little bit of concern that the ceasefire, which we weren't quite sure when it was going to take effect, having an early wobble with a strike from Iran and then Israel feeling the need to respond to that. So it's incredibly fragile. I mean, these are two countries who've been  firing missiles and drones at each other only days ago and getting the two countries to stand down is very difficult given their history, given of course the weakening that Israel has done against Iran through its proxies Hezbollah in Lebanon, its continuing war in Gaza against Hamas. There's a lot of complexity there. So it's very difficult to get a ceasefire  and make it stick. And beyond that, it's really hard to get a path towards some kind of more stable diplomacy. Of course, we've seen many rounds of talks to try and get some kind of deal over Iran's nuclear program. Those talks have gone nowhere. Maybe now they've got a small window. I mean, Iran has obviously seen that Israel and the US mean business, so that might prompt something. But how or when diplomacy can get a chance here, that is also very unclear.  Mm. Meanwhile, NATO, the NATO gathering, the Secretary General Mark Russia has dialled up the flattery of President Trump to kind of warp speed. The President, though, on board Air Force One, you heard him there kind of crackly talking about collective defence. It depends on your definition. This will surely alarm Europeans.  Well, it certainly will, because they spent months and months preparing the ground for this meeting, this summit of NATO leaders, and the idea being to basically avoid Donald Trump saying or doing anything that might cast further doubt on NATO. So careful preparations to get people to agree to this 5% defence spending.  amount. Of course, Spain not yet there, which is awkward for Rote and NATO as a whole. Other countries dragging the chain also, arguably, on that and trying to avoid Trump again putting the question mark over Article 5, which is this framework really under which NATO operates. The idea that you defend each other when needed. I mean, Article 5 is pretty clear on that, but Donald Trump already on the plane over, musing aloud about what  it might mean. And that's really what we've been expecting. The idea that for Europe, at least, this has all been a significant wake-up call. For Europe, when you're thinking about the future, you've got to presume that the US may not be there, even despite the Article 5  existing or coming to aid in a different way than you'd expect, different kinds of assistance. And that's certainly the parameters that Donald Trump now seems to be laying out. So whether he commits to something at the end of this remains to be seen. We'll see in a press conference later today, but certainly it's off to a bit of a wobbly start. Okay. RMEA News Director, Rosalind Matheson. Thank you.  Now, as more people start using artificial intelligence tools at work, competition is heating up for enterprise contracts. So Microsoft, the dominant supplier of workplace software, seeing its AI assistant co-pilot lose out to OpenAI's chat GPT. The behind-the-scenes dogfight is complicating an already fraught relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI. Our reporter Tiwa Adebayo is here with more on this. Tiwa, good morning.  How big do you think the rivalry between Microsoft and OpenAI is?  The answer is, it's pretty big. It's certainly very lucrative and it's actually still growing. It's something of an unlikely situation, actually, given that Microsoft has invested nearly $14 billion in OpenAI since 2019. So, you'd think they might be all in on the firm. But actually, also in that time, Microsoft has backed other rival AI startups. They've built their own models and they've stalled OpenAI's restructuring plan. So, the relationship is slightly fraught.  On the other side of that equation, you have OpenAI. They've signed deals with rival cloud computing partners, so Microsoft rivals. And for example, they've recently agreed to acquire AI coding assistant Windsurf, which directly competes with Microsoft's GitHub copilot.  So, the two seem to be the frenemies in the tech world at best. But they're also, of course, competing for market share in the corporate world. OpenAI says it has 3 million paying business users, whilst a Microsoft spokesperson said CoPilot  is being used by 70% of the Fortune 500. And their paid users have tripled compared with this time last year. So it does seem that Microsoft is slightly edging ahead in that corporate race for now. But as our reporting shows, that could all be about to change. So what are they competing on, I suppose? What are the selling points for each of these companies with their products?  Well, that's the thing, Stephen, they're quite similar. So, both companies are essentially pitching AI assistants that can help with the sort of labour-intensive administrative tasks in the workplace, so writing, research, analysing data, and they're saying that they can free up workers to focus on more meaningful challenges. And it gets worse because both chatbots are largely based on the same open AI model, so very similar offering on both sides. Microsoft  spokesperson is quoted in our really detailed story about this on the terminal and they say that what sets them apart is Fine-tuning the technology for business use so after all Microsoft has been in the corporate space for much Longer programs like Outlook and Excel for example their workplace staples So they know what's going on and whilst chat GPT dominates the consumer space Microsoft says they're in tune with business needs and that's why they have Barclays and Accenture for example as clients  But our reporting is showing that many office workers are convinced that ChatGPT is the better product after using it in their personal lives. And so now they're actually convincing their bosses to make the switch over to OpenAI.  So, in terms of the broader effects then on the use of AI on the workplace, I mean, I must admit I've been messing about with AI, but it is much more, you know, at home for things outside of work. It's obviously going to be coming to workplaces in a big way.  Yeah, I mean, there's been a number of reports saying that there are benefits of using AI in the workplace in terms of productive capacity and also really speeding up those menial tasks. For example, this week, there's new research from MIT that says AI agents can raise worker productivity by 60 percent. So AI agents being complex sort of artificial intelligence models  that can work autonomously and can actually be fine-tuned to employee personality types as well. So, some pretty high-level things going on. Some are really just banking on this technology for a breakthrough. We heard from Andrew Bailey recently, Governor of the Bank of England, who suggested that AI could be used to sort of counter the collapse in the U.K. 's long-term growth rate by really boosting productivity.  But having said that, there are concerns about the potential for AI use at work to lead to job cuts, especially when it comes to junior roles. Those are the ones that usually comprise of more of the administrative tasks, and they're largely taken up by graduates who are already facing a difficult job market. So some concerns there. It's not all positive news when it comes to AI in the workplace, but it's certainly making an impact so far.

Another, to reflect on the past 24 hours, was inconclusive. And I think that's key. There are different ways to look at what's happened over the past few days. Trump got a result. He got a win. That's true. He forced Israel and Iran to back down. And I think that was a reflection of his clout.  He always likes high stakes games, doesn't he? He's unconventional, yes. He's full of jeopardy, of course. But very often, a lot of what he does is inconclusive. It's about the quick fix. And in the context of Iran, the Iran problem is far from over.

You know, for me, this whole episode is kind of in playbook Trump, it's reminiscent, in a way of Trump style on other issues like tariffs, he inserts himself into the moment, he elevates a crisis, he brings everyone to the brink. And then because he does have power and leverage, he defuses it all again, he claims a win, he pumps his chest, he projects power. As I say, we can't take away from Trump, the fact that he did stop all this, he stopped a war,  albeit maybe temporarily, he certainly didn't solve the underlying problems. But stopping the war, calling these two leaders, getting them to come to heel, that is a projection of power. But if with the tariff issue, he simply returned countries to the place where they were before he became president, he is slowly doing that. Well, then I think with the Iran crisis, you could argue that he's actually made matters worse than they were before.  because it's probable that Iran will no longer comply with the nuclear inspectors, who may well be kicked out soon. And the principal focus now of the Iranian regime is now more than ever survival. And I'm sure they will attach themselves to China and to Russia.  tighter than they ever have done before. There is of course though James another view to all this and I think it's worth considering. It was articulated very well because he does articulate himself well by J.D. Vance, the vice president. He said on social media of course  He said, we're seeing a foreign policy doctrine develop that will change the country and the world for the better. Number one, he said, clearly define an American interest. Number two, negotiate aggressively to achieve that interest. Number three, use overwhelming force if necessary.

So regime change can come in a couple of ways. You can replace the people with folks in Iran who don't want to kill all the Jews, which I think are most people. Or you can get the regime to change its behavior until the regime  recognizes Israel's right to exist, this problem doesn't go away. So, to me, a prerequisite to any negotiations after the cease-fire should be acknowledgment by Iran that they've abandoned their policy of destroying the state of Israel. They're now willing to live with Israel. They can have grievances against Israel. They can have concerns about Israel policy. But they have to abandon the goal of killing all the Jews in Israel.

I saw the two-year Treasury auction happen today, yield of 3.71. That is pretty high. We got to actually control our long-term borrowings. But the Fed needs to do their part.

That, in my view, is what we should be doing going into the future. The general broad assumption is that central banking has worked in the past.

They say this, a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment has determined that U.S. strikes over the weekend on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's program by only a matter of months. That's according to three sources to Reuters that the initial report was prepared by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's main intelligence arm, and one of 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. According to two of the sources,  who requested anonymity here. This is being described as a low confidence intelligence assessment here. What's going on?

Why?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 227.894, "text": " First, let's just note that when you start seeing leaked intelligence and interim assessments, it's politicized. Somebody has an agenda, and I don't know what that agenda is, but I don't think that we should be looking at this one assessment as the only assessment.  Right. There is this battle damage assessment that we've all been waiting for. There was the first one that came out, you know, something like 12 hours after the initial attack. And we saw Pete Hegsath, our secretary of defense, alongside his generals talking about what they thought was achieved in these strikes. There should be a couple of revisions over time. And I think what we will see from the DIA will be integrated into whatever that final assessment ultimately ends up looking like. As for the program itself,  Let's just review what's gone on here. I mean, the Israelis destroyed a massive amount of above ground infrastructure relating to the nuclear program. On top of that, we know that the Israelis assassinated no less than 14 nuclear scientists, as well as individuals that were involved in the administration.  of this Iranian nuclear program. Then you have the Trump administration ordering these B-2s to drop the mops, the massive ordnance penetrators, these bunker busting weapons on three different sites. It's really hard for me to imagine that the Iranians are just going to bounce back from all of this.  Now, we do know that there were trucks that lined up outside one of the facilities and they may have carried off some of that 60% enriched uranium. That is a scenario that I think folks are still grappling with. I think that there probably are still some secret facilities that the Iranians never declared, but that should be a good indication  of who we're dealing with here. This is a regime that we could never trust and probably necessitated, at the end of the day, the kind of attacks that the Trump administration carried out and that the Israelis carried out. But I think the last thing that I would just stress here is that the Iranian regime now knows what happens.  when it engages in this kind of illicit nuclear activity, it will invite the Iranians to get struck by the Israelis, by the United States. And I think what we've watched over the last 12 days is that the Israelis could do so with impunity.  the United States could do so with impunity. And I got to think that that is a huge deterrent for the regime. Some may say that, well, this is the exact reason why Iran will make a dash for a nuclear weapon. I'll just say that is a terrible risk right now for the regime if they try to go down that path.  very closely right now for any false move that they can discern by the Islamic Republic."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 399.2, "text": "Okay, let's just kind of flesh out though some of the reporting because there's a lot here on this. You were citing that could be political in nature with someone that has an agenda. The White House and the Pentagon really strongly and vehemently opposing these reports. Ayesha Hasni quote tweets Secretary Hagseth's statement at the Pentagon  He says this, based on everything we've seen, and I've seen it all, our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target and worked perfectly. The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran. So anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the president and the successful mission.  Caroline Leavitt, though, at the White House saying this, fake news CNN strikes again. She says this alleged assessment, in quotes, is flat out wrong. And it was classified as top secret, but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous low-level loser in the intelligence community. The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program. Everyone knows what happens  when he dropped 14 30,000-pound bombs perfectly on their targets. Total obliteration. You know, Jonathan, I put the before and after satellite imagery at the Fordow nuclear site there. Let's put this back up. Jennifer Griffin has a little bit more reporting.  She, in her reporting, says this assessment was deemed low confidence. That's intelligence parlance. She says it's based on satellite images and signals intelligence obtained since the strike. She says the focus of the report is on the battle damage assessment at Fordow, which we're seeing right now, that the U.S. B-2 MOP Bunker Buster bombs were able to cave the entrances to the facility, which is built 300 feet underground. She says the entrances  are caved in. Some infrastructure was destroyed, according to the assessment, but the overall operations were not destroyed. And they could, quote-unquote, dig out and rebuild and repair the power to the facility that powered the centrifuges. She reports this, that according to this assessment, an unknown amount of the highly enriched uranium was moved out of the Fordow facility. To your point, Jonathan. And she says, one possibility, according to the DIA assessment,  is that it was moved to the third site that the Iranians told the IAEA about ahead of the strikes. That's a secret site. And of course, DIA is one of these 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. So just kind of wanted to flesh this out. To your point, though, Jonathan, if Iranians were to restart their nuclear program, they have to start at square one, don't they? Or no?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 567.571, "text": " I mean, let's put it this way. I don't know how many centrifuges they're gonna be able to pull out of Fordo and be able to use. I don't know which scientists are going to work on this program. And I also know that if the Israelis begin to see any activity in or around these sites, and they try to start digging out, and they try to reconnect it to the grid,  You don't think that the Israeli Air Force is going to scramble those F-35s and start doing more damage again? Because the Iranian regime still doesn't have air defenses, last time I checked. And last time I checked, the Israelis had flown hundreds of sorties in the skies over Iran because they  were no air defenses left for the regime to use. And so, you know, it's just really hard for me to imagine that in a matter of two or three months that, you know, the nuclear program is back humming along again. I don't want to say that this is simple, and I don't think that it's an open and shut case. There are things that I think we still need to chase down. Whether the regime was able to carry out that enriched uranium, that seems to me something that we  We all need to get a handle on right now. And yeah, I think it'd be great to try to figure out whether these mobs did everything that they were supposed to do or whether there's follow up work that may be needed, whether by the Israelis or by someone else, maybe forces on the ground for that matter. But I don't see this as a failed mission. I think it's very clear that when you look at what the Israelis did before the United States came in and what the United States did after the Israelis had  paved the way for all of this work to get done. I see a nuclear program in shambles. I see a regime that was shamed on the world stage. I mean, they were upstaged by the Israelis for 12 days before the U.S. even came in to do any of this work.  And so I just it's really hard for me to believe that this was a complete failure based on everything that we've seen and what we're hearing from the White House. They're pushing back pretty emphatically. And look, some of this, of course, is bluster. We know that, you know, on the part of the Iranians and maybe even a little bit on the part of the White House after carrying out these attacks.

I'm still watching to see whether we see attacks in the United States, asymmetric attacks, terrorist attacks on the homeland. There's a lot that I think could still go wrong here. But I will tell you this, that no matter what happens,  We have a challenge that we need to deal with as it relates to Iran. They've got their proxies that need to be neutralized around the region. They've got a nuclear program that they need to relinquish, and they need to announce that they're giving up on this. They've got a ballistic missile program  that still needs to be dealt with because we can see the damage that that was able to do in Israel over the last several days. It was pretty rough out there.

I mean, I will cede here that I don't believe that the Islamic Republic can still be the Islamic Republic if it capitulates to the United States and Israel. These are the two greatest enemies, declared enemies of this really horrific  dictatorial, apocalyptic regime. And so for them to see defeat to the two countries that they call the great Satan and the little Satan, that's a difficult pill for them to swallow. But there are a couple of things that we're still watching right now. Number one, you had the crown prince of the previous regime that fell in 1979,  came out in Paris the other day and called for the Iranian people to rise up. So there is this sort of interesting question of whether the people now sensing that this current regime is weak, that it was unable to fend off these attacks by Israel and then the United States, there is the possibility for a revolution of sorts. And I'll be watching that very closely. I also think that there is a possibility that the Supreme Leader, as he calls himself, Ali Khamenei,  He may have lost the confidence of the ranks below him. I know that if I was answering to a man that had just lost as badly as he just did, I think I'd probably start to question the leadership of this man. He's clearly led the country to ruin.  In many ways, the damage that was delivered to this regime is going to take years to bounce back from. Set aside the nuclear program for a minute and just understand the economic damage, the damage to production of not just military platforms and munitions, but also gas and oil.  and other key assets of the regime that they have used to hold power. A lot of that is now in rubble. And I've got to wonder whether people underneath the Supreme Leader are beginning to question his leadership. And I think that would be a very positive thing as well. We've got a lot of unknowns that we're still watching for. And right now,  I don't think anybody really knows how to answer them, certainly not the DIA alone.

This was a war that began on October 7th of 2023. And it started with the Hamas attack. And then the next thing you know, Hezbollah is firing at Israel. You got Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria firing at Israel. You got the Houthis firing at Israel. You've got unrest in the West Bank. And then you've got Iran itself.  Now, I think it's really important that Israel finally took it to the epicenter of this campaign that's being waged against it. And that center, you know, we call it the head of the octopus, right? Israel was dealing with all these tentacles, and I think they chopped a lot of them off.  Then they went to the head of the octopus and they started taking it to Iran as well. When you look around the region right now, you see a lot of weakened Iranian proxies. You see a weakened regime, but they are still acting like they still have something left in the tank.  I mean, the attack on Al Udeid on that base in Qatar the other day, it was perfunctory. It was for messaging alone. They had telegraphed the entire thing to ensure that there were no deaths and no injuries and that these missiles would be shot down. They wanted to be able to project strength to their own people. So they're still perpetuating this fiction that they're in control.  And as long as they're able to do that, as long as they're still fronting that they have strength, we're not out of the woods. And I do think that the Israelis are going to have to think about what it looks like to elicit a complete capitulation, whether that's even possible. I don't know if it is, but for right now, at any rate, we have weakened Iranian proxies and a weakened regime itself.  But the war has not ended. Israel is still fighting in Gaza. Israel is still on alert in Iran. But let's just be very clear. The Israelis, starting from October 7th, were flat on their back. They were surprised. I mean, it looked like it was a knockout, crippling blow.  When you think about what's happened over the last 600 plus days, how they have gotten back up and started taking it to their enemies one at a time, and ultimately arrived in Tehran and dominated the skies, total air superiority for 12 days. And now there is no real threat of a nuclear program anytime real soon. And when you look at their military, there's no air force  in Iran. There's no air defenses in Iran. It's a game changer. Again, I don't think it's time for a victory lap. I think we still need to assess. But I think the Israelis have done incredible work, capped off with an unbelievable strike from the United States. But we've got more assessing to do, more intelligence to process, and then some decisions potentially ahead.  for what might be needed to really deliver that knockout punch.

In a moment or two, we'll take a look at the Fed's path with Joanne Bianco, senior investment strategist at BondBlocks. But we begin this morning with geopolitics.  Israel and Iran have spent the better part of the past two weeks exchanging strikes, and in the process, the U.S. was drawn into this conflict. The situation highlights the role of another power player, though, China. Joining me now is Jenny Marsh. Jenny is Greater China EcoGov team leader for Bloomberg News, and she joins us from our studios.  in Hong Kong. It's always a pleasure to benefit from your perspective. And as long as we're talking about geopolitics, let's talk about what's going on between the U.S., Israel and Iran. Now, after the strikes, the recent strikes by the U.S. government on Iranian nuclear facilities, Beijing issued a strong condemnation and basically called it a violation of the U.N. charter and of international law.  I'm wondering whether or not China may have played a role in this. Do you have a sense of that?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 114.823, "text": "My sense is that China very much here will be remembered for sitting on the sidelines. You know, like they issued this very strong statement condemning the U.S. and they talked about how America was sort of blowing up, you know, the international system for sort of maintaining order, i.e. the U.S.-led, you know, U.N. framework for resolving conflicts.  And before the US strikes, you know, Xi and Putin had got on the phone and sort of worked out this four point plan for peace. But really, for China, they kind of left it at diplomacy. And I don't think, you know, they were particularly effective in what they were messaging.  We know that Wang Yi spoke to both the Israeli and the Iranian foreign ministers. So there was some sort of attempt at sort of backchanneling. But essentially, you know, Tehran, you know, China is one of Tehran's sort of strongest partners. And when it came to its darkest hour, China really didn't do much apart from call for peace."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 175.677, "text": "Is it pretty much a selfish move that boils down to crude oil? Is that really what this is about this relationship?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "China"], "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 183.445, "text": " I think this relationship is about the US. And I think one of the reasons I say that is, yes, China is one of the places that will buy sanctioned Iranian oil. It's a very, very slim percentage of China's oil supplies, about 10%.  And they can easily source this oil from other places. And I think, you know, there's a couple of practical reasons why these sort of, it's mainly sort of these teapot refineries in northern China that take this oil. It's much cheaper. But also, I think the Chinese government tolerates it because they are vehemently opposed to the US sanctions regime.  And so they let this go as a way of sort of defying the U.S. sanctions regime, which is something they and Russia and Iran are all united in opposing. But I think the broader relationship with Iran has been about sort of finding partners that will join hands with Beijing and challenge the U.S. sub-world order.  And I think you can see that through, you know, she has ushered Iran into the BRICS group of emerging markets, which is this block that it's expanding with India and South Africa and Brazil as sort of a kind of a rival framework to the G20. It also welcomed Iran in the last couple of years into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is another sort of grouping that it's expanding, which has more of a security flavor.  But when it comes to sort of trade with Iran, I mean, the trade is very, very, isn't significant. It doesn't sell much to Iran. Actually, trade with Iran actually fell off in the first four months of this year. It was down about 20%. And the broader Middle Eastern region, from a Belt and Road perspective, is more important to Beijing. So I think, really, this was sort of a partnership of convenience. And for China, it was always about finding partners  that will join hands with it to stand against the US."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China"], "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 297.301, "text": " So to that point, maybe China is not solely reliant on Iranian crude oil. I get the fact that they're only going to import, let's say, 10%. But the Strait of Hormuz, I would imagine, is perhaps more critical. And if there were a way for Beijing to become influential in dialing down a lot of this tension just so that the conflict didn't extend into the Strait, is that part of the thinking here as well?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China"], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 324.807, "text": " Yeah, so I think the Strait of Hormuz is definitely a different story and a much more alarming concern for China. About 45% of its oil shipments come through that strait and China is the country that is most dependent on the oil coming through that waterway globally.  So, yeah, massive exposure there. That being said, China has been stockpiling on oil. So, if there was a crisis that closed the strait for a short period of time, it wouldn't feel the immediate impact. But in the long term, absolutely doesn't want this conflict to spiral. And I think that was the message  from the four-point plan that she put forward. He talked about not wanting this to expand. And when they were condemning the US, they were saying the US was fanning the flames of war and would be to blame, essentially, if this did become a broader conflict. I think the problem for China is,  how can it affect, how can it, or what is it willing to do to stop it from becoming a broader conflict? And the answer is not very much. You know, China doesn't like to get its hands dirty in foreign conflicts. It definitely doesn't go anywhere near the U.S. playbook of these sort of faraway wars and military operations. And even with Russia, which it has a much stronger trade relationship and sort of interdependency with, and Russia has now overtaken Saudi as the top supplier of crude oil to China.  even when Putin went to war in Ukraine, she was very careful not to do anything that would invite US sanctions. So yes, he stepped up economic support and diplomatic support. And then there was some controversy about sort of, you know, the dual use items that have been shipped, but never any direct, you know, military support that would cross these red lines that America and Europe laid out very clearly. You know, and I think China is a country, you have to remember that has no formal allies.  by design, you know, and its self-interest will always be its sort of North Star of what it does when these kind of conflicts break out."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China"], "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 446.068, "text": "Do we want to include North Korea even at the fringe?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China"], "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 450.034, "text": "Yeah, North Korea is the closest that China does have to an ally.

You know, and ties between Xi and Kim have been sort of entering this frostier period over recent years. And we've seen then North Korea become closer to Putin.

And it hasn't been as prominent as you might have thought, sort of broadly towards American people. The Minecraft movie came out in China and did pretty well. And we've seen other sort of examples of sort of American soft power being powerful, even though the US and China are locked in this trade war.  I almost wonder if the Chinese people sort of are able to separate Trump and, you know, the aberration or, you know, that is Trump from the average American people. There were people talking about, you know, how foolish Iran had been to sort of trust the U.S. saying, you know, the U.S. came in to negotiate, then its ally hit Iran, and then the U.S. hit Iran. You know, the Iranians were fools forever trusting America. So there was a lot of that kind of sentiment.  But I think actually the Chinese people sort of, it is not this sort of like rise in nationalism. And I think that is partly because the Chinese government has learned from the first time around, the first trade war, you had this wolf warrior policy that really stoked up a lot of bad feeling. Then you had sort of people like Hu Sijin, the old, the former editor in chief of the Global Times, who were allowed to sort of really run wild on social media. You know, when Nancy Pelosi was flying into Taiwan, he was,  posting things about, you know, perhaps shooting down, you know, the jet as she came in, which obviously just was a step too far. And I think this time, the nationalist voices on social media and state media have been tampered down because the government doesn't want it to get out of control to a point where they are not the ones managing the narrative."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China", "Apple"], "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 603.717, "text": " Jenny, it's always a pleasure.

Florida's AG saying alligators and pythons will be waiting for anyone who escapes.  And Cliffhanger, the semi-driver, hanging on for dear life as his truck dangles over a rock ledge. This is NBC Nightly News with Tom Llamas.  And good evening. Tonight, a fragile ceasefire holding as new questions emerge about the impact of those US airstrikes. NBC News reporting tonight that the American strikes on those three Iranian nuclear facilities only set back Iran's nuclear program by three to six months. That according to one preliminary intelligence assessment. The White House now calling this initial assessment flat out wrong.  President Trump rebuking both Israel and Iran today over their actions in the tenuous hours as his ceasefire agreement was about to start. Though blows between Iran and Israel were traded just before the deal, with the IDF targeting an Iranian missile launcher and Iran delivering a deadly strike on an apartment building in Israel. We've got our team covering it all from Israel to the Netherlands, where we start with Kelly O'Donnell.  Tonight, President Trump in the Netherlands for the NATO summit, wielding a diplomatic win on the world stage, with the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran still holding. The ceasefire is very much in effect.  And I think we're going to keep it there for a long time. The president projected more confidence that the U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, which included B-2 bombers, 14 bunker buster bombs, delivered a fateful blow. Photos before and after appear to show significant destruction at the sites.  However, in a new development tonight, a preliminary assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that the Iranian nuclear program has been delayed by three to six months, according to three people with knowledge of the report. The White House disputes that initial assessment, calling it flat out wrong. Iran will never rebuild its nuclear. From there, absolutely not. That place is under rock. That place is demolished. The B-2 pilots did their job.  And this tonight from the director of the UN's nuclear watchdog."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 215.277, "text": "What we see is a very important degree of damage. The Iranian nuclear program has been set back significantly."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 222.307, "text": "Still, his all-cap style of diplomacy under stress tonight. The red carpet European welcome, quite a contrast to the blunt and profane way he left Washington today, furious over additional strikes by both Israel and Iran after he outlined his ceasefire plan.  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing. In flight on Air Force One, he recounted a tense call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.  Behind the scenes, a senior White House official says the president, over the past 48 hours, had called Netanyahu with a clear demand, no more war. Then a trio of top officials, Vance, Rubio, and Whitkoff, were directed to reach out to Iran to deliver the message that a ceasefire was expected. And here at the NATO summit, the president shifts to a broader agenda of diplomacy.  And Kelly joins us now live. Kelly, let's go back to that initial assessment of the damage to Iran's nuclear sites. You have more reporting on the White House reaction?  And Tom, the White House is effectively saying, hold on. The Pentagon is still examining the consequences of the strikes. Also tonight, we're learning that for the first time, lawmakers have been able to see some of the analysis by intelligence agencies that is secure. And they were able to do that in a secure location. And that is a new development. Tom.  All right, Kelly O'Donnell for us. Kelly, thank you. All of this as there were some tense moments on the ground before President Trump's ceasefire plan took effect, including a deadly Iranian strike on Israel. Here's Richard Engel with the TikTok of how it happened. Around 520 AM in Israel this morning, it did not look like peace had a chance.  President Trump announced his ceasefire just a few hours ago, but these sirens mean that Iranian missiles are inbound. By 540.  One of those Iranian missiles slammed into an apartment building in Beersheba, in southern Israel. It was one of the deadliest attacks of the war against civilians. And this is where the missile exploded, destroying this entire floor of an apartment building, killing at least four people, and maybe killing the ceasefire before it even takes hold.  As recovery efforts were underway, Iran fired more missiles, this time after the ceasefire was in effect. Israel quickly vowed revenge for both attacks, scrambling its jets, until President Trump publicly rebuked both sides. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land,  Israeli jets dropped a bomb on a radar station outside Tehran and turned back. Just a few hours later, President Trump's ceasefire began to hold.  The streets of Tel Aviv sprung back to life. A partial state of emergency banning school, work, and gatherings was lifted. And in Tehran, while Iran's military and nuclear program have been severely damaged, people poured into the streets for celebrations, cheering that Iran stood up to the US and Israel and remained standing. Richard, let's pick up right where you left off. This may be a positive sign for the ceasefire. Iran, Israel, and the US all declaring victory tonight.  Well, that's the way you want a ceasefire to go. Prime Minister Netanyahu got what he's long wanted, the United States to join an attack on Iran's nuclear program. President Trump didn't get sucked into an open-ended Middle East war. And while Iran is still standing, it's much weakened. Tom.  Richard Engel for us. Richard, thank you.

Yeah, Tom, it's a red-hot Democratic primary on a day where some records, temperature-wise, are falling. Now, there was some concern initially, Tom, we could be losing power at the polls. We have received no reports of that so far. Also worth noting, ballot scanners have backup batteries. So even if the power does fail, those can last hours. Tom?  And it could be just too hot for some voters. All right, Sam Brock for us. I want to bring in Bill Cairns. Bill, such a brutal day there. So many records broken. And now we know the tropics are heating up as well. Yeah, we've got our A-name storm. But first, let's start with the numbers, because this wasn't your normal day. Boston ended up going up to 102 degrees, the hottest ever recorded in June.  And JFK Airport also went over 102. Philadelphia 101. Newark was 103. These are numbers that haven't been hitting over a decade in some cases. Tomorrow the sizzle continues, but we take it down just the notch. We'll have a dozen or so record highs by the time we get to Thursday and Friday. Everything will come back down. And as far as the tropics go, this is not a storm that any of us have to worry about. This is tropical storm.  way out in the Atlantic. Just a reminder that the season is here. Our next bee-named storm will be Barry, but there's no signs of that coming anytime soon. Okay, that's good news. We'll take it. Bill, we thank you for that. Now to a new migrant detention camp in the Florida Everglades. Officials there are calling it Alligator Alcatraz, suggesting the swamp's wildlife will prevent migrants from escaping. Here's Gabe Gutierrez.  Tonight, construction is underway deep in the Florida Everglades on a massive migrant detention camp that state officials are calling Alligator Alcatraz. Starting next month, 5,000 migrants will be housed in trailers and heavy-duty tents at this remote, abandoned airfield.  As I call it, alligator Alcatraz.

The White House slamming that initial damage assessment.  This, as new polling from CNN finds, a majority of American adults disapprove of those strikes. Tonight, Trump's ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, despite last-minute attacks by both sides before the ceasefire, threatening to derail that ceasefire, Israel hitting this missile launcher in Iran.

Kelly, let's go back to that preliminary damage assessment from the U.S. strike this weekend. You're getting more reaction from the White House?  Well, certainly, Tom, the White House is deeply invested in the success of this mission. The president used a lot of his capital to carry that out. And what they are saying is that the Pentagon is still analyzing the consequence of the strikes. Also important to note that there are lawmakers who have been eager for any kind of classified briefing about what happened and what the future path may be. And we're told tonight that some lawmakers have been given some access to initial reports, and they were able to view that in a classified setting. Tom?  All right, Kelly O'Donnell for us. Kelly, we thank you. All of this as there were tense moments on the ground before President Trump's fragile ceasefire plan took effect. NBC's Richard Engel is on the ground in Tel Aviv, where residents are quickly returning to everyday life.  Around 5.20 a.m. in Israel this morning, it did not look like peace had a chance. President Trump announced his ceasefire just a few hours ago, but these sirens mean that Iranian missiles are inbound. By 5.40...  One of those Iranian missiles slammed into an apartment building in Beersheba, in southern Israel. It was one of the deadliest attacks of the war against civilians. And this is where the missile exploded, destroying this entire floor of an apartment building, killing at least four people, and maybe killing the ceasefire before it even takes hold.  As recovery efforts were underway, Iran fired more missiles, this time after the ceasefire was in effect. Israel quickly vowed revenge for both attacks, scrambling its jets, until President Trump publicly rebuked both sides. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land,  Israeli jets dropped a bomb on a radar station outside Tehran and turned back. Just a few hours later, President Trump's ceasefire began to hold.  The streets of Tel Aviv sprung back to life. A partial state of emergency banning school, work, and gatherings was lifted. And in Tehran, while Iran's military and nuclear program have been severely damaged, people poured into the streets for celebrations, cheering that Iran stood up to the U.S. and Israel and remained standing. All right, Richard, let's pick up right where you left off there. This may be a positive sign, right, for the ceasefire. You have Iran, Israel, and the U.S. all declaring victory.  And that's what you want for a ceasefire to hold, at least in the short term. Prime Minister Netanyahu got what he has long wanted, the United States to join him in an attack on Iran's nuclear program. President Trump didn't get sucked into an open-ended war in the Middle East and Iran is still standing, but much weaker. Tom.  OK, Richard Engel and his team from Tel Aviv tonight. Richard, we thank you. I do want to bring in Jason Rezaian. He's the director of press freedom initiatives for The Washington Post. He previously served as The Post's correspondent in Tehran and was unjustly imprisoned by Iranian authorities for 544 days and released in January of 2016. He's also a good friend to Top Story.

But in the short term, I think this is a good sign and an opportunity for diplomacy to kind of do some of its magic, if all sides are willing to partake in that.  So the initial damage report, if you will, that has been leaked and first reported by CNN, The New York Times, and now NBC News, that the nuclear program was not completely obliterated. Rather, it was set back three to six months. Still a massive strike.

This program has existed above ground and underground for years and years. But I think all eyes will be on Iran over the next six to eight months to see what they do. And I just don't see them wanting to risk another round of conflict in this way.  So you have reporting that the Ayatollah was hiding out in a bunker. He had sort of had his succession set up already with three people in line in case everybody was killed. And then you had both Netanyahu and Trump calling on the people of Iran essentially to rise up, to ask for a new government, to demand a new government. What do you think happens with the people of Iran? Does anything change?  Well, I appreciate you asking that, Tom, because I think that's the part of the conversation that we don't hear enough about. The vast majority of Iranian people do not like their leadership, do not want to live in a theocratic, authoritarian state, and would like to see some major changes. Many aspire to a secular democracy. That's not the sort of thing that you can bomb into existence.  At the same time, these bombs, the conflict, the lingering anxiety makes it really hard for people to spill out into the street when they're just trying to stay alive. So I think that the U.S. in particular has to look at this long term and do the kind of  civil society, democracy support that we've done in so many places, not in recent years, but throughout our history. Iran is ripe for that. People are desirous of a freer, liberal society, and we should help them get there.  All right, Jason, we thank you so much for coming on Top Story.

Sam Brock joins us tonight, Sam, I know you have some new reporting tonight about New York's power grid.  Yeah, Tom, that's right. New York ISO, which is the quasi state agency that oversees the grid, raised its alert level to an orange. What does that mean for those watching at home? It means they're not comfortable with the margins. They're asking consumers to be more judicious when it comes to energy usage. Now, Tom, it's not a red alert, which means that some customers would temporarily be taken off of the grid.  It's the stage before that, but obviously we've hit the peak already today. Things are expected to improve tomorrow, but it really does provide a framework for the fact that these were records that we saw today. Belvedere Castle, which is in Central Park, is the official weather station for New York City. Clocked at 99. The last time that happened was 2012, and it is a record breaker for this day, June 24th.  All right, Sam Brock, a lot of details there, we appreciate it. Let's get right to NBC News meteorologist Bill Cairns. Bill, it's a scorcher out there, right? What areas are breaking records and when could things finally cool off? Sam alluded to it a little bit there. Yeah, we still worry about, even at night, I mean the temperatures are so baked in right now that we're not going to get a lot of relief in the overnight hours and that's why we still have these extreme heat warnings that are still up through many of the regions.  So as far as our record heat, all the red dots on here show you where we had records broken. From Georgia all the way to Maine to northern portions of Vermont, 70 plus and they're still coming in. And some of the more impressive records, Boston hitting about 101 to 102 degrees. That hasn't happened in about 13 years. Hottest temperature ever in June. And Boston records go back to like the late 1800s, so the period of record is really long.  So as far as the extreme heat warnings go from Maine all the way down to North Carolina, we're going to get relief tonight and tomorrow in areas of the Ohio Valley, but not in the mid Atlantic region. We're still going to have record breaking heat tomorrow. Philadelphia is going to be near 100 once again. Same with DC to Richmond. Hartford will be a little bit cooler. Boston you'll be cooler too. The big relief sets in by the time we get to Thursday, Tom. That's what we'll be seeing temperatures in the 70s in northern and central New England and only only I say low 90s in the mid Atlantic.  Yeah, we know it's the start of hurricane season and we already have our first name storm out in the Atlantic. Yeah, Andrea popped up was a really small brief system out in the middle of the Atlantic, but it counted because it had winds that were over 30. You know 9 mph and we did see it spinning out here, but all the thunderstorms are gone. It's just a reminder that hurricane season is here and as we start heading towards July and August, the busier months will get more storms, but Barry will be the next name storm. We were done with our a name storm. Andrea falling apart tonight.  Glad it's Barry and not Bill. OK, Bill, well, thank you for that one. We'll check back with you a little later.

When Top Story returns tonight, an update on the Texas teen accused of fatally stabbing another teen at a track meet, now formerly indicted for murder.

Wait till you meet this parrot.  We are back now with power and politics as voters in the country's largest city line up at the polls today to take part in New York City's mayoral primary election, a race that could have national implications as Democrats try to take on President Trump. Here's a look at the Democratic candidates running in this race, political veteran and former governor of New York, of course, Andrew Cuomo, leading the pack, but two other progressive underdogs, Zorham Mamdani and Brad Lander, gaining some serious momentum in these final weeks, notably not on this list,  current mayor Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent after federal corruption charges were dropped. For more on this contentious race, I'm joined now by NBC's Vaughn Hilliard, a good friend of ours, who has been out there at the polls all day, and Jeff Colton from Politico's New York City Playbook, who's been following this race closely for months. Thank you both for being here. So, Vaughn, I want to start with you. You were out talking to voters today. You even talked to Andrew Cuomo. What did you hear?  This is, in a lot of ways, a race that is more than about New York City, but it's very reflective of the Democratic Party. And I asked Andrew Cuomo very specifically, right, three-term governor. His dad served three terms as governor. Everybody knows that Cuomo's in New York. They said, why do you want to return to power? You're 67 years old. The other guy is half your age, Zoran Mdani.  And he said that we need experience to leave a city like this. He says Donald Trump is going to target, like he did LA, New York next. And you need somebody who has shown he can stand up to Donald Trump and is ready to do that again. And I want to perhaps listen to a little bit of that sound here, because I think there's quite a contrast between the two candidates in terms of what they're offering. Take a listen. I trust his experience level."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 25, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1298.933, "text": " He's never had a real job.

Look, Mamdani is endorsed by AOC and Bernie Sanders on the other side. You have Cuomo endorsed by Bill Clinton and Michael Bloomberg. I talked to one voter and I said, who did you select as your first choice? And she said, Cuomo. And I said, so you trust him? And she goes, no. She goes, but he's done this before. But before you go, we saw you there in the interviews. Everyone's sweating. It was hot today. Do you think that had any impact on turnout? 100 degrees. I saw one man actually.  difficult, but he went down on his knees because of the heat there. But I was talking to some poll workers that said they had several older folks that came out there, and they were determined to vote here. So we saw a steady stream. Yeah. I'm going to ask our great director, Brett Holey, to put up that full screen of all the candidates running. And Jeff, I want to show this to our viewers, because there's a lot of people running. It can fracture the vote. There was a guy named Bill de Blasio that sort of emerged out of nowhere, I remember, in a race just like this, a primary race. Andrew Cuomo doesn't have this locked up, right?  He does not. For the past five months, he led every single poll. He was the heavy favorite. He had 99% name recognition, whereas Zeran Mamdani, he had something like one out of every three voters knew who he was. But he just kept on climbing, climbing, climbing. Now everybody knows him, and this is basically a toss-up. I mean, we do not know what's going to happen tonight. Jeff, you get to play civics professor tonight, OK? So explain the rank voting, that rank choice voting that happens here in New York City.  That's right. So Democratic voters can pick up to five candidates, rank them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Tonight, we're going to know everybody's first choice. But next week, we're going to find out who was ranked 2, 3, 4, 5. They're going to redistribute the votes. They get rid of the candidates that don't have many votes. And the lower rankings get redistributed up to the leading candidates. It's a way to basically, instead of just having you vote with, you know,  It's a way to let you vote with your heart, kind of, you know, vote for who you actually want. People say it's a better style, and it will definitely affect the race tonight. This is a great graphic. Let's leave it up here so viewers can understand this. And Jeff, I want to ask you, who does this help, then, in this race, do you think? In this case, it helps Zoran Mamdani. He has done a real ranked strategy. Him and Brad Lander, the number three candidate in the polls, have been campaigning together constantly. Folks like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they've been saying, rank these candidates, do not rank Cuomo.  And Andrew Cuomo, he's basically just been running a solo campaign, only himself. Today, he voted. We asked him, who did you rank? He said, only me, one person. If you're a Republican strategist and you're watching this and you're working with Donald Trump, you might be a little happy. And let me explain why. If Andrew Cuomo wins, right?  Vaughn, you're going to have a candidate who wins that goes in the face of the MeToo movement, that goes in the face of those prosecutions of Donald Trump in the civil lawsuits. What does that say about Democrats and the Democratic Party? Do they really care about those things? And also kind of like in 2020, right? People ended up going for Joe Biden.  and the more centrist candidate, older generation. And in this case, you could very well have that happen again. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, they're making the case that thousands, tens of thousands of people are coming out for their rallies across the country to take on Donald Trump. But ultimately, when it comes down to the ballot box, are they for that type of Democratic Party, the Democratic Socialist, sort of new generation, or are they continuing? Is the Democratic Party, that electorate, still behind your more centrist, older generation?  Jeff, we've got 30 seconds. If Mamdani wins, what message is that sent? Well, yeah, Mamdani is 33 years old. I mean, he, as AOC said at one of those rallies, this is the gerontocracy of the Democratic Party against new energy, that sort of thing. So this is a rejection of the establishment, which we've seen in many elections across the country, across the world, and it's an embrace of a younger, untested, democratic, socialist, leftist candidate.  We really ran out of time, but I have one more question. If Adams does run against whoever wins here, is the winner of the Democratic primary, you think, the next mayor of New York City, or does Adams have a chance? There's still a shot. We are going to have a competitive November, I think. All right. Jeff Fon, so great to have you guys both here. Appreciate it.

You know, July is just a week away, and at first, the facilities will have 500 to 1,000 beds at that location. Now, the plan is then to expand capacity in 500-bed increments. Some 5,000 beds will be online soon."}, {"keywords": ["Export"], "line": 32, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1837.955, "text": "Now, DHS says soft-sided temporary facilities will initially be constructed, and then it's possible hardened buildings  could be built at a later date. And an administration official tells us that right now across the country, ICE has nearly 60,000 detainees in custody."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 33, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1854.999, "text": "It's only budgeted for about 41,500, Tom. All right, Gabe Gutierrez for us. Gabe, we thank you. Now to some exclusive NBC News reporting concerning the FBI. The agency is reassigning some agents, pulling them off immigration cases, and focusing them on issues of national security in case of a potential threat from Iran.  This is according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter. But here's the situation. Some of them were already reassigned before that. For more on what all this means, I'm joined now by NBC News Justice Correspondent Ken Delaney. Ken, explain to us the back and forth here and why this is sort of a problem for the FBI.  So, Tom, under the Trump administration, there's been a massive redeployment of FBI resources towards immigration cases, which is not typically an FBI priority. But FBI agents have been tasked with accompanying ICE agents on raids, trying to track down undocumented immigrants. And many of them have been complaining, including to me, that they feel like this was taking their eye off the ball of some very important threats. After all, after 9-11, the FBI's top priority has been to stop terrorist attacks in the United States.  Well, over the weekend, a memo went out from the director of counterterrorism at the FBI to field offices saying, we're going to pull some of these people back and put them on Iran-related counterterrorism, counterespionage and cyber threats, because the belief is that, in the wake of this U.S. attack on Iran, the country is at greater risk from Iranian proxies, Iranian-sponsored terror threats.  What some of my FBI sources would say is the country was already at risk from ISIS-related terror threats and domestic terrorism, and only now is the Trump administration sort of reorienting these resources. Better late than never, they would say. The Trump administration, the FBI said in a statement to us that the FBI is continually reassessing the threat picture and realigning resources as needed, Tom.  All right, Ken, and I do want to also ask you here, since we have you on the show, the other headline regarding the Trump administration's mass deportations of Venezuelans to El Salvador in March. A whistleblower says a top DOJ official suggested ignoring court orders on deportations, alleging that, email Beau, that Trump's former personal lawyer said the DOJ would need to consider telling the courts to F you. So, Ken, talk to us about these claims and what we know about the players involved here.  Yes. So, the whistleblower is Erez Ruvini. He was a longtime DOJ prosecutor who was fired after he told a judge that, remember, Armando Abrego-Garcia, the man who was taken to that prison in El Salvador, now brought back in charge. This prosecutor told the judge that this man was improperly deported, which was factual, but got him crosswise with the Trump administration. So, he was fired. Now he's written a whistleblower complaint to the inspector general and went to lawmakers, alleging that, behind closed doors, the number three official at the Justice Department  Amyl Bovey mused about potentially violating court orders in the context of taking these immigrants to El Salvador, because, remember, judges were trying to stop that. And one federal judge has already said that there's probable cause to believe the Trump administration violated his orders.  Now, the Trump administration, the Justice Department, in fact, is disputing this. Todd Blanch, the deputy attorney general, says he was in those meetings, and no one suggested violating court orders. Tomorrow, there's a hearing, because Emil Bove has been nominated to be an appeals court judge. So he will be under oath, and he will be asked about this matter, Tom.  could be quite the moment. All right, Ken Delaney, first. Ken, love having you on the show. Next tonight to top stories, health check, and a major warning tonight when it comes to ticks this summer. Researchers at Fordham University setting the tick risk at 10 out of 10 in the New York region, meaning people should use extreme caution when outside.  The scale advising people who are thinking of going on a hike outside to go to the movies instead. Health officials bracing for an increase in tick-borne infections, including more cases of Lyme disease. A trend the CDC has been tracking. Cases have been more concentrated in the Northeast since the tracking began in the 1990s. You can see how they increased almost a decade later in 2010. And then in 2023, the most amount of people impacted by the disease, most cases spread by a tick bite.  For more on what you can do to protect yourself from the growing tick population, I want to bring in Dr. Eric Ascher. He's a family medicine physician at Northwell's Lenox Hill Hospital here in Manhattan. Dr. Ascher, thanks so much for coming in. Do we know why they're spreading like that so crazy?

Thanks for coming on the show tonight. Up next here on Top Story, the new warning in Europe, the deadly virus that's sickening thousands of people at a popular tourist destination. And Cobra Kai confrontation, a Karate Kid actor accused of biting and then kissing his co-star's arm. What? This all happened at a fan convention. Tonight, her reaction, his apology, and the moments police responded to the scene. Stay with us.  We're back now with Top Stories Global Watch. We start with European health officials issuing a warning to travelers about an increase in hepatitis A infections. They say it's happening in four popular destinations, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. Nine people have died so far. More than 2,000 others have gotten sick. Hepatitis A spreads primarily through contaminated food and water, most commonly when an infected person doesn't wash their hands after using the restroom.  OK, a man was rescued from the cab of a truck that was hanging over a collapsed bridge in China. Look at this. You can see him there talking to the person who shot this video. A statement from the local Department of Transportation saying the collapse was due to a landslide. Three other cars were found at the bottom under the bridge, but no people were found. This collapse is under investigation.  and once one of London's best-kept secrets, set to become one of its most highly anticipated attractions. Here's what we mean. A series of underground tunnels dating back to World War II will transform into an intelligence museum, interactive World War II memorial, and one of the world's deepest underground bars. Literally. Dug in the 1940s, the tunnels were made in secret out of fear of a Nazi invasion, and later acted as a government communications center. The London tunnels are planned to open in 2028.  And staying overseas in Venice, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos and fiancee Lauren Sanchez are throwing one of the most lavish and highly anticipated weddings of the year, maybe of the century. The guest list and itinerary under wraps, but some notable guests like Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have already been spotted arriving in the floating city. Not everyone is happy about the upcoming events with activists and some locals organizing protests. Here's NBC's Molly Hunter.  It's one of the most romantic cities in the world.

And not only that, they're working with the Bezos-Sanchez team to make sure it all runs smoothly.  The city is in contact with the organization of events, and we are trying to have all the information in advance to deal with them. But the happy couple and their bikini-clad friends don't seem all that worried, kicking off the big week with a rowdy phone party on Bezos' yacht, the Coru.  But the finer details of the multi-day events are closely guarded, and the couple reportedly making last-minute venue changes. Now moving one of the lavish parties to the city's old port shipyard, the Arsenale, more discreet and much harder to access, unless, of course, you're in a superyacht. And they've taken over the iconic San Giorgio Maggiore, a stunning separate island that offers even more privacy.  Once they are coming in, here is going to be a different world because it's quiet, lovely, relaxing. But the billionaire's extravaganza is more celebration than ceremony.

We do have some hints about who might be joining based on the celeb studded bachelorette Lauren had back in Paris. But city officials say this is a city used to hosting major events. You heard that in the piece with lots of people, including VIP weddings. Of course, we'll all remember the Clooney wedding.  and officials say that some guests have already arrived.
