I agree wherever anti-Semitism is found, we should denounce it vehemently. This is a huge issue that has come up, particularly in the past few years. I think anti-Semitism is rooted not just in an ancient bigotry against the Jewish people  but oftentimes in a movement that seeks to fundamentally unwind civilization, particularly Western civilization. Of course, our Western civilization that we enjoy is rooted in Judeo-Christian values, the very cultural foundations that we as conservatives seek to conserve.  But unfortunately, we find too often that there are organizations, particularly and oftentimes on the left, that are vehemently anti-Semitic. We've seen for years the BDS movement grow. In the United States, a movement that refers to Israel as an apartheid state, refers to their supposed genocide, calls them a settler colonialist state, refers to them as supremacist.  We've seen the rise in the Students for Justice in Palestine movement, a movement linked to Hamas that openly across college campuses after October 7th praised Hamas and defended them, making college campuses oftentimes completely inhospitable for Jewish students. Shut them down oftentimes.  And then we have Code Pink. We saw some of their members in this room earlier today, a group that is connected to the CCP that is ostensibly anti-war. And yet, right after October 7th, the day after October 7th, put out a statement not condemning the genocide of Jews, but supporting the Palestinian movement.  saying, quote, resistance is a human right. The human reaction to being oppressed is to resist, and Palestinians deserve that right just as much as everyone else on the planet. They went on to say Palestinians are confronting the world with their truth, and it is one that should be supported and respected. That was the day after October 7th.  And then we have members of Congress comparing Jews to termites, saying that Israel has hypnotized the world and calling it evil. And then, of course, shouting the slogan, from the river to the sea. There's a leading mayoral candidate in New York right now, right now, who refuses to condemn the phrase, globalize the intifada.  That is sickening that this is in our political system.

Joel, I have him here if you want to see him on what's in the budget reconciliation bill for the Golden Dome, the different light items. They're here, so it's pretty specific. But what we do here  is that in a whole host of other areas, we try to drive timelines, right? So put timelines on the development of this, which, as you know, statutory timelines can be very, very useful to move a project forward. We mandate testing, real-world testing, which is kind of this yin and yang thing with the military. They wanted that provision, but some don't like it. But we drive that, again, for innovation.  We have a whole host of areas that you might not think of as when you look at our great graphics works of a golden dome. To Senator Sheehy's point, we definitely have provisions that look at the counter drone component. You don't want to build a beautiful shield that's very expensive and then get hit by cheap drones. So we have focus on that. We have a focus on what they call left of launch.  which is actually cyber and kinetic capabilities that you can take out a threat before they launch it. So we are trying to look at this problem very comprehensively to make sure we're not  having any gaps. And then there's a lot of focus on the defense industrial-based reform, integrating both the legacy systems. Alaska, you know, we're the cornerstone of missile defense with all the ground-based missile interceptors in the country right now at Fort Greeley, all the big radar systems out in the Aleutian Island chains, a clear air station. But we're integrating that with new technologies, particularly in space, and the fact that  This really emphasizes off-the-shelf acquisition. There's so much out there that we can do in terms of competition, and this whole idea of open architecture. New software, new system designs that come together. So we are filling in a number of the elements that are laid out in the budget reconciliation bill, particularly on driving policy, making this happen quickly.  And we're pulling a lot from the president's executive order. So it's an integrated effort, and we think having it in the law  makes it really, really important to keep this legacy initiative beyond the Trump administration for our country.

You might have noticed that the President has appointed the Vice Chief of Space Operations, General Michael Gitline, to be the direct report over Golden Dome.  We put in the bill that the direct report is to the Secretary of Defense. Now, we also know that the current Deputy Secretary is going to be very, very involved and very active. That's appropriate. But we want to make sure that it's crystal clear how high a priority this system is to the defense of the nation. And both with General Goodline's background and experience and his current role,  and his commitment to the types of things we're talking about in terms of speed and acquisition reforms, and with our constant encouragement. You know, one of the reasons I believe, one of the reasons that the Pentagon hasn't used some of the acquisition authorities they actually have is because they're afraid of guys like us, for good reason. You know, we have a history, we being Congress has a history of playing gotcha with everybody that makes a mistake. We need to be just the opposite. We need to be able to say,  Try things.

This is multi-year stuff that we're going to have to fund over time.  So it's very important that we have the kind of blueprint we're talking about, which Dan went through, and also then the approach that Kevin talked about, where somebody's responsible.

The prosecution rested its case after its 34th witness wrapped his testimony today. The summary witness was a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations. Did he bring it home for prosecutors in their final attempt to prove the sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution charges against the music mogul?  And the defense wrapped its case after a very brief presentation this afternoon without calling any witnesses, even the defendant himself. I'm criminal trial attorney Sarah Azari, and this is Serving Justice. Joining me now are Jesse Weber, NewsNation Legal Contributor and Law and Crime Network host, Safiya Samia Ali, also an attorney, NewsNation reporter, who's been following this trial very closely, and of course,  our favorite News Nation field producer, Tommy Cristaldi.  who's been inside the courtroom throughout the trial. Everybody, welcome. We're in the last stretch of this trial and all the salaciousness around it. I'm really glad to be having this conversation with you guys. Jessie, I wanna start with you. The prosecution wrapped its case today with a summary witness who went over texts and voicemails and invoices, a lot of stuff. I mean, there's been other summary witnesses in this case as well.  He's the witness who sets this chronology and essentially connects the dots for the prosecution.

You're trying to say that Sean Combs transported sex workers and these alleged victims for the purposes of sex work. Remember, for those charges, you don't need to prove force, fraud, or coercion. It's more of a straightforward charge. You got the travel receipts, you got the cash payments, you got the messages. I mean, a lot of the messages were Sean Combs  a central focus of coordinating all of this. There was even a message where he was speaking with Cowboys and Angels, that escort service. So it's been supremely difficult for the defense to try to isolate him or say he didn't know what was going on. He didn't really know who was being paid for what or who was being transported. And I think even where the defense was trying to say under cross-examination, you know, he was paying for certain things from his personal account and not necessarily the business account. Sure.  Sure. Right. That might help with a racketeering charge that might help disprove racketeering. He wasn't getting all of his staff involved. He wasn't using his resources. But at the end of the day, if he's paying for it or organizing it or coordinating it, that's where I think it becomes really, really difficult for the defense to argue a way against this."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 173.278, "text": "I think a lot of it, you know, you mean for the prostitution.

If he feels like the government really overreached and wasted tax dollars, he's ultimately the sentencer here. And I don't think under any circumstance he's getting the max. But I think that's where his fairness will kick in. How serious does he think this conduct was and how much has the prosecution abused their power in prosecuting Diddy? But I think also,  you have to understand that there's mitigating factors here, that the idea that he was using drugs, abusing drugs, and there's been a lot of testimony about, was he under the influence when he did this? Was he under the influence when he did that? I think that's not only gonna be argued in closing argument to show that the Sean Diddy that you would be convicting is not this guy, is not the real guy, it's the guy that was under the influence of drugs, right?

Anyway, Safiya, the defense presented its case without calling any witnesses. I mean, we know that the burden's entirely on them, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, all of that. And the jury gets the instructions for that as well.

The defense doesn't have any obligation to call anybody. But as a juror, this could go a couple of different ways, depending on the juror. I mean, it could go where they feel that the defense did their job with cross-examination and evidence, and they buttoned it up, and they're like, you know, mic drop, we're done. We don't need anything more. And that it kind of shows that the prosecution didn't meet its burden, so they don't feel like they need to put anything back, and it's kind of a slam dunk for the defense.  But there's going to be jurors who are going to wonder and be curious why the defense didn't call anybody. Was there nobody they could have called? Was there not a former employee? Was there no one that could have spoken up for this person? And they may that might raised doubt in their mind and they could be thinking the defense could have done more. Why didn't they do more? And that could kind of turn the wheels in a different way. So that's why it's really important that the judge makes it clear to these jurors that there was that burden is not on them.

And where is that Christina quorum that we've been hearing about all the text messages, all the testimony about her? I think these jurors are going to have a lot of questions. And I think it's clear. And as I'm thinking back on this trial, I realize this prosecution has taken a lot of turns. I think they plan to have  a certain case that we're going to put on, and this turned out to be a little bit different than their plan. And the jury's going to notice that. The jury's going to notice everything that's missing. The one thing that I thought was surprising, I thought they would at least put on their own expert, their own psychological expert. But again, I don't know what the value of that is when you're dealing with, I mean, it's clear, they're saying consent, prosecution is saying coercion.

Look, with Jane, US percentages, I think there's a 15 to 20% chance they convict them of sex trafficking. With Jane, not even because they even had to cross examine her so much, just look at the mountain of text messages. And that, to be very clear, you can have a victim  who says yes, nine times out of 10. If she says no, that's it. There are messages that she said she was reluctant because she wasn't feeling well. She was exhausted. She felt she was being used. The jury could say she was being forced into this. However, there was a mountain of evidence, a mountain of messages where she's setting up these events. She's encouraging them. She's expressing her love.

I, again, haven't done too many of these, so I don't know how standard that was, but the sense I got was that it was not standard at all. It was a bit strange that he said that. I think that there are maybe a couple of explanations that I've come up with as to why he did. One, just as we're sitting here talking,  Maybe he knows that there's an impending sentencing and he wants to remind the judge he's a big fan. Maybe it's because, you know, this is his way of reminding us he is in control of his legal team all throughout the trial. We've seen him passing the notes.

And this was also a huge win for Benjamin Netanyahu, that they started this war that America came in in support of Israel.  And then this ceasefire was in both America's interests and in Israel's interests. I don't entirely agree with the point that you made in your introduction. I think this was a win for Trump, and it was a win for Netanyahu. But I do believe that President Trump wanted to protect this very significant achievement of the ceasefire, because if we have  these 13 days of Israel's massive degradation of Iran's capabilities, plus the United States getting involved, and then everything stops here, that's actually a pretty good outcome for Israel and for the United States.

And the Sunni neighbors, Gulf neighbors and others around Iran are worried that Iran, if it is able to reconstitute, certainly if it gets the kind of support from China and Russia that I anticipate it may well receive, that Iran could not now, not a month from now, but not long from now, become even more dangerous. So that's why this is not the end of  something, but it's a very significant win for Iran, for the United States and Israel.

I'm talking about the Chinese artificial intelligence breakthrough known as DeepSeek, remember that? Which caused Wall Street to turn its back on the AI data center cohort. Earlier this year, we were told that the Chinese had come up with a way to build AI models using far less hardware, meaning chips from NVIDIA. And it crushed every stock in the group.  With the biggest casualties being the stocks of all the companies needed to create high-speed computing and generative artificial intelligence.  Today, the deep-seek nightmare officially came to a close, as data center tech led the way back up, driving the averages to near their all-time highs, Dow jumping 507 points, S&P climbing 1.1%, NASDAQ pole-voting 1.43%. How's the pleasure? Almost back to where it was before everything started getting kerflooey.  This rally is a total reputation of everything you heard back in January when we accepted that China had beaten us in AI. It was almost a replay of the Sputnik affair when the Soviets launched the first satellite to orbit the Earth on October 4th of 1957.  Back then, we had an inferiority complex about the Soviet Union like we have now about China. We decided we were finished. We'd never catch up to them in the space race. But not only did we catch them, we leapfrogged them, and we never looked back. When the deep-sea news broke, Wall Street exhibited the same inferiority complex, and everything AI-related got hammered. Everyone just accepted that China had come up with something revolutionary that made all of our artificial intelligence efforts pointless.  They know nothing! Almost no one dug into Deep Sikh's highly misleading numbers. But just like with the Russians in 1957, it was all chimerical.  We never heard from the Chinese again, did we? Except that they were willing to go to the mat to get their hands on NVIDIA second-rate semiconductors. Not even the best of them. We were never going to give them that. It didn't work. Our governments came to some sort of agreement. But we didn't give them the chips they wanted. Chips they wouldn't have been going begging for if Deep Sikh Sputnik had been a real breakthrough.  Why didn't any of the naysayers and pessimists put that two and two together? If they had, they would have stayed in these stocks, as we did for my travel trust. This data center renaissance, so shocking to the people who abandoned these stocks, the NVIDIAs, the AMDs, the Vertivs, the Microns, the Marvell Technologies, are all back or nearly back. And the story that NVIDIA CEO Jensen Wang calls the new industrial revolution is once again front and center. It's like deep-seek never happened. The AI stocks,  They're all breaking out. Of course, success has many fathers, and this rally is about more than just the data center. Just a week ago, we were trembling about what would happen in the Middle East. As we watched oil prices climb and climb, the decline in oil earlier this year had been our hope to offset the rising price of tariffed goods, but suddenly was going away because of the war between Israel and Iran. Stocks which had tried to climb back once again seemed ready to roll over. It felt like only oil stocks were worth five  For all its prowess, Israel seemed unable to stop Iran's nuclear program on its own. But then, this weekend, President Trump bombed Iran's three big nuclear enrichment sites, and suddenly Iran no longer had a viable path to become a nuclear power. Of course, Wall Street wasn't really worried about the Iranian nukes at all. It was worried about the price of crude.  The usual pessimists assume that Iran would shut down the Straits of Hormuz, blocking 20 percent of the world's oil supply. But that would have represented a major escalation. And without a functional nuclear program, they just didn't have the cards. In fact, Iran is desperate for money, which means they need to keep the Straits open, not closed, to sell their own oil, 1.7 million barrels a day.  Once the Bakke thesis got taken off the table, oil plummeted from $78 and change at its highs yesterday to the mid 60s today. It's given up all of its gains since the mini war began. And I think, by the way, that oil has got a lot more downside.  With crude going in the right direction, we're back in the declining inflation story. It wasn't enough to get Fed Chief Jay Powell on board with rate cuts today. He just told Congress that he wants to wait and see. But there is enough slowness in the economy, particularly in housing and autos, that I think we'll definitely get rate cuts at some point this year, tariff or not.  That's the other leg of this rally that's driving up so many stocks. But now, I got to go back to this thing that I know you care about so much. This tech situation, this deep-seek affair, is one of the most instructive stories I've come across in years of trading. It's a microcosm of everything that causes people to get the market wrong, to lose money, to write off stocks in bizarre embrace of American mediocrity.  In a market with the memory of a Mayfly, it may be impossible to remember, but DeepSeek's ability to do so much more with less went almost unquestioned because it was China. And if DeepSeek's numbers were real, which I don't think they were, then all the hyperscalers, the Microsofts, the Googles, the Amazons, the Orals, were wasting billions upon billions of dollars on unnecessary AI hardware.  If you believe Dream Seek, it meant that virtually every tech executive was an idiot. Our tech titans, we were told, had lost their minds. All that build-out simply could not be justified. We had visions of tens of billions of dollars worth of write-downs. So you had to sell every one of these tech stocks."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 351.597, "text": "Every one!"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 352.419, "text": "And that's exactly what happened.  For months on end, I told you it was a mistake and a handful of experts called out DeepSeek's numbers. But for the most part, nobody listened except CNBC investing club members. And we will convene tomorrow noon to talk about it. These AI companies became the punchline of endless jokes about overvaluation, with the biggest joke of all being NVIDIA.  You couldn't go a day, make that an hour, without hearing about all the brilliant hedge funds that sold NVIDIA, could you? The company which had been leading a new industrial revolution suddenly became a one trick pony, a semiconductor maker that needed China to make its numbers. But it wasn't going to be allowed to sell it. So what do you do? You had to sell, sell, sell.  Those of us who champion the data center in general, and NVIDIA specifically, look washed up, clinging to a thesis that had been defrocked by the Chinese. We tried to argue that perhaps the whole thing was highly misleading, but DeepSeek never actually disclosed their full costs, including their hardware costs. Yeah, they didn't even tell you what they spent on chips and servers. Yet somehow their numbers were treated as gospel, and anyone who questioned them, they were regarded as insane. Now looking back, with so much of tech bordering on new highs, it's clear that these stocks never should have been sold in the first place.  because Deep Seek simply wasn't that meaningful. With the data center story back on, all those analysts and hedge fund managers, newsletter writers, have to try to get back into these stocks.  the ones they dumped at much lower levels. They might be able to get back in if we have a tariff fiasco, maybe they can have an earnings report or two, but I think they'll be left behind.

So stay with Kramer.  All right, what's going on with these numbers from AV? That's the drone-focused defense contractor you may remember as AeroVironment. The company just reported a significant top and bottom line beat, but its earnings guidance was a tad light versus expectations, and the stock's been real volatile in the after-hours trading, as it often tends to be. So we checked in earlier with Waheed Nawabi. He's the chairman, president, and CEO of AV, again, former AeroVironment, to learn more. Take a look.

Thank you, Jim. Wonderful to be with you.  As the averages rebound in response to a possible detente in the Middle East, we're now back to levels last seen in February, before the whole market got derailed by President Trump's tariff agenda. Four months ago, everybody was really ready to give up on all speculative stocks that had been flying lately. People were eager to throw in the towel on anything connected to artificial intelligence, with the whole AI complex getting crushed until the market-wide bottom in early April. But now all these groups are on fire again. It's like the tariff turmoil and the open conflict with Iran never happened.  Throughout this period, including at the top of tonight's show, I always told you that nothing had really changed on the business side, that the AI bull market was just as strong as it was in January, if not stronger. I thought it made no sense to give up on such a powerful story, which meant the AI stocks got cheaper as they went lower. And now we know that was true. So today I want to think about what it means to say that we have a long-term bull market in artificial intelligence, one that can get knocked down, but like Chumbawamba, gets back up again.  That's why we're going off the charts with the help of Joe Fami. He's the portfolio manager at Zur Capital LLC. He's also the founder of JoeFami.com Education, because he's got a unique take on the situation. When you look back, we've had a bull market in all things AI going back to late 2022, early 2023. You can argue about the exact start date, but certainly by May of 2023, the AI revolution was upon us, because that's when NVIDIA, the backbone of artificial intelligence, delivered one of the greatest earnings reports I've ever seen.  And aside from a detour earlier this year, the stocks never really looked back. We know that in terms of money-making potential, AI is more of an enterprise technology than a consumer technology. But Fahmy points out that ChatGPT was still the fastest application to reach 100 million users in history. ChatGPT got there in two months after it launched. TikTok took 13 months, Instagram 26 months, Snapchat 39 months, Facebook 42 months.  I've been telling you that AI represents the next industrial revolution, and Fahmy sees it the same way. Just like railroads, personal computers, cell phones, the Internet, AI can help us boost productivity, and higher productivity translates into higher stock prices across a whole host of industries. That's why he thinks it's safe to compare the AI bull market to the great Internet boom from 1995 through early 2000. Normally, when someone makes a comparison to the dot-coms, they're implying that the bubble will burst and we'll all end up in tears.  And it's true that dotcom collapse was terrible. But man, the late 90s gave us one of the greatest bull markets I've ever seen. People made fortunes and they kept those fortunes as long as they were disciplined enough to ring the register on some big gains. Follow me once to make this comparison more explicit. If the bull market is following in the footsteps of the dotcoms, then we've got two or three more years of incredible gains. Years. Take a look at a chart from Bespoke Investments comparing the action in the Nasdaq composite  from the mid to late 90s in blue to the current moment in red. He starts this with the release of Netscape at the end of 1994. This first chart shows you how the Nasdaq roared in the first three years following the launch of Netscape, which is a real game changer in terms of Internet access. Fahmy says if you look at the AI bull market from the launch of Chad GPT, their trajectories, well, they're kind of ridiculously similar.  Now here's another chart that shows you how things played out for the Nasdaq Composite in the five years following the launch of Netscape. So if Fahmy's even partially right, we could have a lot more gains in the AI cohort over the next two or three years.  Of course, that doesn't mean you should go all in AI here. Even though 1995 and 2000 was one of the greatest bull markets in history, there was insane volatility along the way. For instance, in late 1997, we witnessed a horrific, horrific correction thanks to the East Asian currency crisis. In the summer of 1998, we took a beating from the Russian debt default and the collapse of a highly levered hedge fund that was called Long Term Capital Management.  Take a look at how the S&P 500 traded in 1998, okay? It's really important because we had a terrible summer followed by a terrible fall.  The market only recovered after the Federal Reserve stepped in with an emergency rate cut in October of that year. 1998 was so bad I'd almost put my hedge fund out of business. But then we came roaring back. The S&P raised all of its losses by December. And 1999 was one of the best years on record. So even if FOMI is right that we're in the middle of a five-year bull market in AI, one that could last until 2027, we're still going to see plenty of corrections, some shakeouts, some pullbacks along the way. In fact, we just escaped from one, didn't we?  Fahmy points out that coming out of the correction in late April of this year, we caught an incredibly bullish technical signal. It's called a Zwei breath thrust, named after my late hero, Marty Zwei. This is when the 10-day moving average of the percentage of advancing stocks goes from below 40% to above 61.5% within the 10 trading days. When that happens, it shows a decisive change in momentum. You know, we've seen only 19 of these moments since World War II, and all 19  have led to above average returns over the next 12 months. Well, maybe we're going to join them up. Fahmy also points out that there's been an insane level of call option buying, specifically call options, that expire in June and December of 2027. It's been happening in Amazon and Google, Nvidia, Tesla.  Broadcom surface. Now, if the bulls are right, then these stocks can take up the entire market. We've seen that before, haven't we? At the same time, he notes that the VanEck Semiconductor ETF, the SMH, has been consolidating for the past year. That looks poised to break out to the upside. Big consolidation upside.  Given that NVIDIA's been roaring lately, while Taiwan Semi and Broadcom have also started working their way higher, he's feeling very bullish about the chipmakers. I also like the action in AMD and Marvell. Of course, this is not just about the bull market and AI. Whether or not the Fed cuts rates at its next meeting, it's very likely that rates will go lower over the next 12 to 24 months, not higher. And lower rates are almost always good for the broader stock market.  Look, if the AI boom is really a sequel to the dotcom boom, then that's good for more than just the AI stocks. We had all sorts of big winners the late 90s because people felt so good about the stock market. So here's the bottom line. The charges interpreted by Joe Family suggest that the AI bull market is following closely in the footsteps of the dotcom boom, which would mean we've likely got two or three more years of gains.  even if we definitely won't get there in a straight line. Keep that in mind the next time something happens that makes you want to give up and sell everything. Let's go to Michael in New York. Michael. Hello, Jim. How are you? Booyah. Booyah, Michael. I'm in Arizona, but I'm from the Bronx.  I have a question concerning CrowdStrike. I purchased it in 2020. I'm up 649%. It got to 10%. I sold a third. I got my principal back as well as a significant profit. It is back up to 8% of my holdings. Do I hold it or do I take more profits?  Many disciplines involved here. Obviously, you exercised the first discipline. That was terrific. Next discipline, you're a little bit too overweighted in CrowdStrike, but I do like CrowdStrike very much. Why don't you take it down a percent? Just take it down to seven. And then I think you let it go. It's a little bit more like what we do with the Travel Trust. We'll talk about it again tomorrow at noon. But thank you for sharing that with us. You know, I think CrowdStrike is terrific. The charts, as interpreted by Joe Fami, suggest that this AI bull market has a lot of similarities to the dot-com boom, with some outsized gains still to come.  So just remember that the next time you want to give up and sell everything. Much more mad money, including my sit down with the CEO of MasterCard. I'll get engaged in what kind of disruptions these stable coins might be posing to the business. Fresh off the company's annual shareholder meeting. Then discipline will always trump conviction in the stock market. I'll tell you why it's more relevant now than ever. And of course, all your calls rapid fire tonight's edition of The Lighting Round. So stay with Kramer.  Over the past couple weeks, Visa and MasterCard, two of my favorite companies, have pulled back sharply from their all-time highs. Wall Street's suddenly worried about the whole payments industry might be threatened by advances in crypto, especially now that Congress looks like it'll pass this genius act, which establishes a framework for regulating stablecoins. Visa fell over 10 percent from its high set on June 11th to its low last Friday. MasterCard dropped more than 11 percent over the same period, though both stocks have rebounded this week.  In part, that's because there's no reason these companies can't deal with stablecoin, too. In fact, MasterCard already supports a bunch of them. This morning, I spoke with Visa CEO Ryan McInerney. And Ryan told me, I think, a story which made me feel like that you'd be nuts to be in this, frankly. And McInerney's a very smart guy. But I got another guy I want to hear from. This is Michael Mieback. He's the CEO of MasterCard. After the company's annual meeting earlier today to find out what he thinks. Mr. Mieback, welcome back to Man Money.

So when you think about what we do as a company, it's kind of all relevant payment choices. Somebody wants to be paid or pay with a debit card, credit card, prepaid, whatever, you name it, we have it. And as of late, that does include Stablecoin. There are some use cases where Stablecoin does add some value.  There are niche opportunities, but let's think about why that is and what is new about stablecoins. So fundamentally, if you look at innovation in payments, it always comes down to a couple of central things. People got to trust it. They got to understand what is it doing. It's going to be simple and it's going to be secure. That's the standard for debit, credit, prepay. Everything has ever happened. Buy now, pay later, you name it. So stablecoins.  in itself is a rail. So we have leaned in because we said, OK, it actually does help with some use cases. Let's take its cross-border payments. But we can add our safety, our security, our trust that people feel they want to use it. So we've invested in technology for the last 10 years. So it's starting to become a potential driver of payment innovation in the future. And we're at the head of it."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 26, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1777.829, "text": " Well, should I be worried if I'm a MasterCard shareholder that countries that have very unstable currencies might have people who want to use this product, use stablecoin, and therefore may disintermediate the exchange fee, the interchange fee that you get?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 27, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1795.21, "text": " So from a MasterCard perspective, you know, if you take the basic stablecoin, you still have the need for safety, security, you still have the need for our cyber security, all the protections. And that doesn't come for free. That can't be free. Well, we're investing in that, and therefore there is a value to be brought. So very clearly, we are needed to make sure that stablecoins will become a part of the fabric of the payments ecosystem. And now how about this FiveServe partnership, which is a very novel company?  So what we're going to do with Fiserv is basically make it easier for traditional financial institutions who are now also getting interested in stable coins to offer these to their customers. So Fiserv is at the back end of banking ecosystems. They will help facilitate that in partnership with us. One good example of that is the MasterCard One credential. So it's an opportunity for a consumer to choose at the moment of transaction, do you want to use credit, debit or now stable coins?

You know, there's a tremendous opportunity there. So the secular growth opportunity remains. We're differentiated versus anybody else out there in terms of geographic coverage. So we can help going after this opportunity in places like Asia, in emerging markets, everywhere. So that's a big part of it.  But what's also changing is the nature of the digital economy. So it's not just cash and checks. There's a whole, you know, take the ride share opportunity. What used to be maybe one taxi ride is a bunch of payments. You pay the driver, you pay Uber, and the people who's actually taking the ride is another payment. So it's a multitude of transactions.

My question is, DJT, given the fact that they are now positioned well in Bitcoin, do you see a short squeeze coming soon? Well, I can't really anticipate a short squeeze, because I don't know. You've got 12% short position. It could be, maybe. The real short squeezes have occurred, sir, when it gets to about 25, 30. I think below that, then you're kind of on your own with the fundamentals. Let's go to Brett in Florida. Brett. Hello. Go ahead, Brett. It's Jim.  How you doing? All right, how you doing? Fantastic. All right. How about a stock? Jim BWX Technologies. All right, that's nuclear. And again, like, you know, nuclear, I'm not going to fight anyone who wants a nuclear stock. I'm going to bless it, even though it's a very, very big.

They're both hard fought, and I thank you for recognizing them. And how can I help you, Dave? Jim, my stock today is Jabil Inc.  Jay Bill is so terrific that even though it's up on a spike, Dave, I am again going to bless it. Why? Because it only sells at 22 times earnings. And it's the kind of company you need to deal with right now. They'll understand all the tariff problems and they'll help you. Let's go to Ian in Florida. Ian. Hey, Booyah, Jim. How you doing? I'm doing well, Ian. How about you? I'm doing excellent. Thanks. Third time caller and investment club member. Yes. See you tomorrow. There are 12 new coppers.  Absolutely, looking forward to it. Jim, I wanted to ask you, what do you think about this company, and is it a good time to possibly enter? It's ACHR, Archer Aviation. OK, Archer and Joby. Again, I'm going with them. Why? Because a news headline, and it can be up 25%. That's what I'm looking for these days. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the conclusion of the lightning round.  The firm's been busy lately putting through a lot of your calls about speculative stocks. I don't mind. I actually like it. You can make a lot of money speculating.  But remember, you haven't really made any money until you sell something. It's all conjecture otherwise. No matter how much you love these speculative winners, you don't have a gain until you actually ring the registry. At the end of last week, for example, Hims and Hers Health, the online health care company, was trading at $64. But then yesterday, the stock fell 22 bucks for almost 35% decline. The cause?  The company had to deal with Novo in order to sell its Miracle Weight Loss drug, Wegovy. Novo canceled the deal, charging hims and hers with deceptive marketing, something the company vigorously disputes. Now, I don't want to go into particulars here because I don't care about particulars. What I care about is that this stock had almost tripled in two months. If you own hims and hers up almost 200 percent and you hadn't sold any at that point,  You were being a knucklehead. Why? Because this is one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market. 35% of the share sold short. A lot of people are betting against it. The haters are plentiful. In that situation, the stock can erupt on any good news. And there was a lot of good news when HIMS was making money with the McGovey deal.  But a lot of those gains came on the backs of the short sellers who were forced to cover or buy back the shares they sold short because they couldn't take the pay. That's why when a stock goes up that fast and there's a big short position, you've got to generate some discipline here. You've got to let discipline trump your conviction. Maybe you have to take something off the table. It's not a case of suddenly hitting a stock that you love.  It's simply that the gains don't count until you ring the register. You can love a stock and still sell some of it. Gradually selling your winners on the way up is responsible money management. Now, this kind of thing is happening all over the place right now. A little worrisome. Take CoreWeave. This is the company that came public at $40 a share, a company I recommended and pushed incredibly hard to you. People didn't believe me. Many chose to bet against the stock. 32% of the shares are sold short.  On Friday, CoreWeave hit a high of $187. Stock still sits at $172 and change. Short imported great quarter. But a lot of this move is because so many people were betting against it because the company picked a bad time to come public. I had tremendous conviction that CoreWeave would make a big move, but not this big. Again, I think discipline must trump conviction. And you got to do some selling here. Sell, sell, sell, sell.  While I still like the stock, I recognize that much of this move was powered by panic short sellers. Take something off the table, please. Finally, there's Circle Internet Group. Again, I have conviction that this company has a bright future in the red hot stable coin market. But I care about the stock price, not just the company.  Less than three weeks ago, Circle Internet came public at $31. It's now at $222 and change, and that's after a 15% decline today. You may think you've made a fortune in this one. However, you've made nothing until you ring the register. I'm not questioning your conviction. I'm questioning your sanity. How can you not at least take your cost basis out?  You can let the rest run. That way you're playing with the house's money. That's the ideal place to be because you'll never lose. Look, I know a lot of stocks are going nuts here. It's sensational. Some of these moves are short squeezes. Others are because of overexuberance. The last thing you want to hear is some old geezer telling you how to sell part of your position.  Know this, though. I want you to make money. And you can't do that until you sell at least some of your position. So tomorrow, examine your spec winners and ring the register on at least part of those positions. Go buy yourself that you've always wanted or put it in the bank so you don't give it back.  Don't worry, I'm not saying sell the entire position. You can keep your favorite stocks. I'm not going against them. But remember, you haven't made a dime until you ring the register on part of your position. Then and only then can we say you made money in a hims and hers or a core weave or a circle internet group. I like to say there's always a bull market somewhere. And I promise to try to find it just for you right here on Bad Money. I'm Jim Cramer.

China is the major buyer of Iranian oil that is a crucial source of income for the regime in Tehran.  The data that we've seen from third party consultants, people who track this data, China was buying about 1.1 million barrels of oil from Iran a day in the month of May this year. That's down about 20 percent, but it accounts for about 10 percent of how much oil China is buying every month. China's buying about 11, 12 million barrels of oil a day and about 1 million plus comes from Tehran.

How much of it that Beijing is willing to use or deploy, I think that is hard to know.  I think, though, that also Iran knows China needs the oil to keep going. And I don't think Iran necessarily needs Beijing to remind it that the Strait of Hormuz is very important to Beijing. I think that's very clear to the Iranians.

I think the fact that these groupings have not been able to step in and help Iran as it was under attack from foreign forces will make them less compelling of a grouping for other countries to join.

The United States does sail warships through the Taiwan Strait on a regular basis in the South China Sea.  There are American bases in Japan, in Korea, in the Philippines, on Guam.

I mean, you know, it doesn't include downtown Austin. And really importantly, there was a safety monitor in the passenger seat, which so a guy sitting in the passenger seat, a babysitter, not behind the wheel, but somehow babysitting the car in a lot of these videos.  The safety monitor has his finger on a button, which I think most people assume is an emergency brake. Is he a jackpot? Yeah, it's the button that kills you if you tweet something mean about the robotaxi while you're in it. Wait a minute, so literally the whole time he or she has their finger like just hovering over the button?  Yeah, or just kind of on it. It seems like there may have been some other types of controls or ways to provide input in the vehicle. You also have, at least according to statements that Musk and others have made on the earnings call, some teleoperation as well. So there probably, in addition to that safety monitor, is a guy sitting at a desk  watching the ride, who is also able to intervene one way or another. I don't think we know exactly what that intervention could be. It could be anywhere from sort of giving the robo-taxi some commands or suggestions all the way to maybe a steering wheel or whatever where that person  and could literally take control. But we don't know exactly what that teleoperation looks like. A lot of supervision now. Obviously the idea is at some point once this thing gets, you know, a little more experience out there, the training wheels come off and it's out on its own in the wild.

There's been one instance that a lot of people have pointed out as particularly concerning.  So there's a vehicle that was starting to turn left, appeared to maybe decide it was going to go straight instead. And the steering wheel really jerked around, and it started to go straight instead.

It did go into oncoming. It did go into oncoming. But then it got it right.  Two hours later, it got back into the well, that doesn't sound good. I mean, I almost feel like I don't need to say this, but this is very much a demonstration in a very controlled demonstration. So we're evaluating it. So so part of why Kara is bringing up these like they sound like very minor examples and they are.  except that this is a situation where there is a ton of monitoring, where the routes have been traveled over many times, where it's like a very controlled, and we're even getting, the information we're getting from these rides is also very controlled because it's being filtered through these fans. But the thing is, what they've done here  really is a long way from what Elon Musk has said they're going to do. And what he said they're going to do, just to remind people, is to be able to have any Tesla anywhere driving around unsupervised. None of that is true right now. There is a very small geographic area, a very small fleet, and there is a ton of supervision.  And I think it would have been surprising if something really bad happened with these tests. Even these minor, you know, screw-ups are a little bit surprising just because, again, this is not all that different from what we saw in October, you know, on the soundstage, right? It's just like a larger version of that thing. And which, okay, maybe that's some progress, but still.  Right. Which gets me to the next point, Cara, which is despite how sort of, you know, just okay, this whole launch seemed the stock really popped yesterday. Tesla stock did it. It rallied 8%, which by Tesla standards, cause it's a very volatile stock. It's not some enormous move. And yet 8% is 8%. It certainly did not go down. So I guess the market market's first take is like, wow, this is great. Big hit."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 608.071, "text": " Yeah, I mean, this is an event that people have been waiting years and years for. Elon Musk has really bet the entire company on autonomy, on AI, on the ability to launch a network like this. And investors are just glad it's meeting that mark on a lot of levels. They will be closely watching to see if it actually can scale from here. It is something that even the most bullish investors are really keeping an eye on right now, though."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 630.329, "text": " Yeah, I mean, is 10% in a day for Tesla a huge move? That's like a Wednesday or something, you know? Esha Day, Bloomberg Tesla reporter, told me she doesn't even get up for an 8% move. Not for Tesla, right? No, not for Tesla. Yeah, for most other stocks. So yes, correct. Look, the other thing is, for this stock,  eight percent is not a huge jump. This is a very volatile stock. But also like there were versions of this day that could have been a lot worse. Right. One thing that has surprised me, frankly, is how cautious Elon Musk is being with this launch, like it in certain ways.  Like, yes, he's putting these cars that in a lot of ways don't seem to do the thing that he says they do on public roads. On the other hand, he's kept this to be a very modest demo, I think much more modest than anybody believed or anybody would have thought. Like, he's talking about teleoperation, which is something that he hadn't talked about before, or he had said if there was teleoperation, that would be a bad sign. So in other words, like, he's being safe, at least, or maybe safer than he otherwise  could have been or some of his actions, like we didn't see as, you know, maybe concerning or whatever, as the incident we talked about with the Tesla crossing over the double line is, you know, there wasn't anything worse. So maybe it's slightly beat expectations that some people had. Apparently, the bar was pretty damn low.  Not that I'm setting a very low bar, but there also may be, like, the enthusiasm may fade because, like, the novelty here of being able to drive, like, from one end of part of Austin to the other is gonna fade. It's like the boring company ride where you can go from, like, one hotel. Yeah, from the Las Vegas Convention Center to the resorts world. You know, Max, last week when you launched your acronym, a response- Are we talking about Mammut or Madra?  There were multiple... Oh right, there were two. You had two. It was a twofer. It was a twofer. I almost forgot about MADRA. No, when you were... Okay, so when you were launching your acronyms, a bit of a riff on taco, Trump always chickens out, hence stock investors buy stocks.  We had asked our listeners, our legions of listeners, to put forth any ideas they may have for acronyms that could improve upon, if such a thing could be done, that would improve upon Mahmoud. And, you know, we got a brilliant idea. Yeah, we got some fun responses. My favorite, and Grant, who responded with a lot of good ideas, but also complaining that we hadn't seen that he had his own acronym, which was Enchilada.  Wait, so he launched it, he alleges, he launched it before you. Unfortunately, the timestamps confirm his launch. Elon never completes his innovative level four autonomous driving announcements. Wow. Enchilada. This guy, obviously, you know, something of a bear, I would guess. He also, in response to Mammut, which he thought was, you know,  insufficiently creative, suggested a few others with the help, I believe, of chat GPT, including, and now these are replacements for Mahmoud, which was Musk always makes up with Trump.

You know, you get up early and have a lot of meetings, you know, looking out at the French Riviera. I wouldn't expect you to understand. But yes, I was at Cannes Lions last week, the wonderful advertising festival. For those who are unfamiliar, it's essentially everybody in the world who is involved in the ad industry from  you know, the big players like Metas and YouTubes and Googles of the world to these agencies, to the creators who are now making a living on this. They all show up and and spend a week together sort of cutting deals and boondoggling and all that kind of stuff. So it was a good time.  Now, what was X's presence there? Because I feel like just last year, its presence was kind of odd, unique. And how did it play out this year? So last year was interesting because Elon showed up himself. And I believe he did a keynote with WPP, one of the largest ad agencies in the world, or I believe the largest ad agency. And he kind of signaled, hey, this is important to me by physically showing up and giving his time.  In years past, X, formerly known as Twitter, had literally like a beachside setup. They set up a \u2013 there was concerts that they had. They would hold meetings there. Curt was all over that. I was. That was back in the day. This was pre-COVID.  When I was there this week, I did not see a single X-branded sign throughout the entire conference. Just to give you a sense, TikTok took over an entire hotel, essentially. Meta takes over multiple floors of a hotel, has a giant beachside thing. Everyone is throwing their logo in your face, essentially. You can't walk down the street without seeing these things.  like right in front of you, X was nowhere to be seen. And I thought that was very notable. So how do I interpret this, Kurt? Are they just giving up? What does this mean? So there's two ways. I think there's a, I'll give maybe the positive X version and the more critical X version. I think the positive is it's not very doge to go to can, right? Like it is not,  for all the reasons I stated at the top. Listen, we're cutting into it a little bit. Okay, fine, I'll admit it's not the most doge thing to go to Cannes. It's definitely a show, right? It's a bit of a circus.  If you're X and Elon is running your company, maybe the last thing you want to do is be seen out here kind of frivolously spending money for a Diplo concert on the beach. I shouldn't say that. Yahoo hosted a Diplo concert. I did go, and it was pretty fun. So, you know, sorry to use that as an example, Yahoo. It was a great time. But my point is, like, maybe Elon is not wanting to be seen doing that kind of stuff right now. That's the positive, like, reason why X might not be visible.  The more negative is that, quite frankly, they either don't have the money to do those kinds of things or they're no longer in that tier as an advertiser. What do you mean they don't have the money? They're a unit of XAI. XAI's got money coming out the year. When I hear about Kurt talking about X's advertising business, I have that feeling of when you hear about a really old celebrity who you thought had already passed away, like,  years ago like it's like oh yeah x has an advertising business i completely forgot because david like you said they are now part of xai and it really seems like this whole part you know this whole revenue stream they're just soylent they're simply soylent for the xai robots not necessarily the metaphor i would have used but yes that's exactly what i mean that's the the cynical way to look at it right is that x is sort of now the  You know that any money they make a gravy and it's the back burner to this much more important thing which is that they're using the data to power xai and that's really all that matters and so. You know if that's the way that that x is it's certainly nowhere near the top of the conversation that it was several years ago in the advertising industry but maybe it has a different purpose now to your point.  But now Max had just said a minute ago that, oh my God, right, X advertising, you know, it's just a corpse, it's a cadaver, it's long since passed. But I actually thought there was reporting, including perhaps from you, that indicated there's been a bit of an uptick in advertising revenue over there at X.  Yeah, we talked about this a few months ago and it came up again this week. So way back in February, I wrote this newsletter that essentially said, hey, we're seeing an uptick in advertising. Elon Musk is out here saying the quote unquote ad boycott is essentially over or soon to be over. Like what gives, right? And what I heard and what I put in this newsletter was essentially that everyone in the ad industry is terrified of not advertising on X.  Because at the time, the owner of the company was BFF with the President of the United States and they were suing people who didn't advertise there, right? So there was this implicit sort of idea that, hey, if we don't spend money on X, we are going to be sued.  It has been talked about for several months. The couple days, maybe a day before the conference started last week, the Wall Street Journal had a more detailed version of that story that said the lawyers for X are literally calling some of these advertisers and making this threat explicit, right? You advertise with us or we will sue you. And that the legal argument is, Kurt, the legal argument is what  What's the legal argument? Well, I'm not an antitrust lawyer. The claim is that this is anti-competitive and that these brands are sort of colluding to damage X's business. Now, I have never really heard of a boycott being considered anti-competitive, anti-trust, right? I mean, think about how people vote with their wallets all day, every day, right? And there's never been any kind of sort of  to my knowledge, like push back on this from a legality standpoint. When you think about what Elon in particular and Linda really have said about free speech, it's quite comical to think that, you know, hey, spend money on our product or we will sue you. Oh, by the way, we're free speech absolutists, right? To me, those things do not really go hand in hand.  But again, on the eve of this conference, essentially, this story comes out that paints X in quite a negative light. Again, it's not totally new. We've been talking about this for months. But it did set a stage, I would say, for discussions around X at the event. And a bunch of people that I talked to last week pointed out, like, this is pretty shady stuff if this is indeed what's happening to people.  Yeah, I mean, Max, I guess I don't understand if they are doing this and they're allowed to do this, I guess I just don't know where it ends. Like, to me, then I suppose the hot dog vendor at the street is, you know, his sales pitch is, buy this hot dog or I'll punch you in the face. The guy selling shovels says, buy this shovel or I will beat you with it.  I mean, it's pretty darn odd, like, and I don't, well, I guess if it's working in the short term, I suppose, God bless him, but man, it doesn't seem like it. Is it working? I mean, the thing that Kurt said that he's got reporting that says revenue is ticking back up. Yeah. I just, again, like you sort of would wonder if we're seeing maybe token purchases, small purchases to deal with.  the threat rather than... Well, let's ask Kurt that. Would token purchases of ads be enough to drive that pickup in ad revenue that you talked about?  Yes, at scale, because remember, the numbers are quite small, right? I mean, this is not like a $100 billion annual revenue company where someone spending 10 million bucks gets totally lost in the sauce. It's like they're making $2.5 billion in annual revenue. So if suddenly you have  you know, a dozen advertisers that have all, you know, spending 10 million plus dollars or whatever it is, that's going to actually be a notable, noticeable jump in revenue, small but noticeable. So I do think the token thing is sort of real. And if you are a giant advertiser, you have to weigh like, is $10 million worth  sort of the public drama of being sued by X and going through a multi-year lawsuit. And I think a lot of brands would just say, no, you just give them the money and run the ad. But is this a sustainable thing? Right. Like to Max's point, like, OK, maybe there's an uptick this year, but like this is not the sign of a healthy business when you have to force your clients to spend with you at risk of lawsuit.  Okay, Kurt, so CEO Linda Iaccarino sat down with an Axios reporter for a panel there at Cannes, and it got a little sporty. Tell us briefly about it. Well, we talked about that story that came out, and so Linda was asked about this on stage, I believe it was on Monday of Cannes, so the very first day of the conference.  And essentially, instead of, you know, either acknowledging, yes, we are doing this or even disputing it, the the real feedback was like she trashed the Wall Street Journal, you know, and was like, does anyone still read that publication?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1563.503, "text": "Right."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 37, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1563.904, "text": "And the whole notion. And you guys are familiar with this because you cover Elon and have paid attention to Elon for years. But like this is a pretty tried and true strategy from sort of Elon Musk as well. Right. Which is like someone writes something that  that he doesn't like or in this case she doesn't like and the response is well i'm just going to bash the journalism i'm going to bash that outlet and those reporters and sort of cast doubt on the story that way and so that's what we saw but it was a kind of a an awkward way to start the week right everyone's there to potentially do these deals and and and perhaps give x  big checks for money for ads. But instead of starting that way, it really started with this sort of combative conversation with Linda. And it did come up several times throughout my discussions that week as just sort of like, it wasn't really a great look for her or X on the eve or the beginning of this important conference. Bit of a buzzkill.  The other thing I'm thinking about as Kurt is talking about this, we talked last week about cash burn at XAI. I think a billion dollars a month was the figure that we had from our reporting. I mean, there's a lot of  cash going out of this combined company, and it sounds like... Well, but for X, it's mostly just going to be for the debt, right? I mean, they've sacked a huge chunk of their workforce, right? I mean, yeah, you're right. They are bleeding money. I'm just saying there's not that much revenue coming into this operation, either from the AI side or from the advertising side.  Yeah, I mean, that fundraise, apparently, which they are still doing right now for XAI, of which X is now a unit, apparently came a touch too late for the big con party. Had that money come in, you know, they would have, you know, that's where Kurt would have been hanging out on Thursday night. Diplo would have been doing a double.  Okay. Now, uh, Curt, don't hang up. Don't leave us, but I got a couple of quick things, rapid fire for Max. And if you have some clever thoughts, some epiphany, sir, weigh in and shout it out. Max, there was another exploding rocket. Yeah.  Over the weekend, a Starship rocket doing a static fire test. That's a kind of test where they fire the engine while it's on the ground. It exploded. I think in the statement, SpaceX called it like a significant anomaly or something like that. But yes, it was a bad... They say the darndest things. You got to give them credit. They have  Rocket engineer speak is funny, right? Anyway, this was bad. This was not something they expected. I mean, especially and it's bad because they just keep happening one after the after another. This is like the third or fourth. Yeah, I think maybe the fourth in a row where we've had it not go exactly right. If Lauren Grush, you know, our colleague and Bloomberg aerospace reporter were here, she just got Kurt.  She would say that, look, these are experimental crafts. Explosions are not totally uncommon or necessarily even unexpected. Sorry, wasn't it, and maybe you already said this, but wasn't it simply refueling? It was a fuel mishap. There was an explosion while they were loading fuel in. Yeah, definitely not supposed to happen. And they're investigating it. And I do think  While these are experimental craft, each time something like this happens, it pushes the timeline back a little bit. And this is a company that is very much under the gun if they want to meet Elon Musk's very, very aggressive timelines for sending these rockets towards Mars or even putting them to tests  that could lead them to go to Mars. So definitely a setback on top of the issues that we've talked about for the last few weeks with Trump and the former NASA appointee. Now, we also had a revelation of sorts on Musk's computer situation.  Yeah, this is where I want Kurt's input here because a lot of people were surprised that in the legal filings between OpenAI and Elon Musk in the dispute between Sam Altman and Elon Musk, OpenAI and Elon Musk, Elon's team essentially said he does not have a computer and that like the OpenAI had been expecting  you know, emails or documents from his computer. I guess they got some from his phone, but his lawyer said no computer. And a lot of people are surprised by this. And my reaction, Kurt, was, is it really that surprising? I feel like Elon's not the only CEO who goes or claims to go without a computer.  Yeah, I'm not. I actually wasn't surprised at that at all for the same reason, Max. I remember in the book I wrote, Battle for the Bird, by the way. Buy it, read it. Yeah, buy it, read it, please. Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and former CEO of Twitter, did his entire job from his smartphone. You know what I mean? He had an iPad that he used from time to time. But really, I mean, like this is a guy running. That's funny. That's like very, you know, elderly, I don't know, or child of him or something. Yeah.  But I mean, like this guy wasn't just running Twitter, he was running Square, now Block at the same time. So a CEO of two publicly traded tech companies who did his entire job from his phone, right? And so, I mean, it's hard for me to imagine Elon sitting down at his laptop and typing away. I think we know he did because he's posted some screenshots of a laptop at one point that the only reason I remember is they were like really smudgy and gross and everyone was like, ooh, your screen looks really gross, you need to clean it.  So I do remember some of that, but no, I'm not surprised to hear he works from a phone. I suspect that laptop is his gaming piece. Like he does play a lot of computer games. But yeah, like these guys have assistants and stuff as well. Like what would you need a computer for if you're Elon Musk? He's got, um, he's got what's what the hell is the name of his robot? He's got Optimus. Optimus. Yeah, he's got like he's got a whole flock of Optimi around him that you're just at his beck and call.  I would be surprising if you saw Elon typing away at a laptop, I'd say, unless he was playing a computer game or composing a meme. Kurt Wagner, thanks as always. Max, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, has ramped up raids across the country. It's part of President Trump's push to deport migrants accused of violent crimes, the people the administration describes as the worst of the worst.  But after months of aggressive action, new ICE data obtained by NBC News shows the agency has arrested only a small fraction of undocumented immigrants already known to have been convicted of crimes like sexual assault and homicide. NBC News Senior Homeland Security Correspondent Julia Ainsley has more."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 38.455, "text": " Good morning, Joe. So we are able to look at two ICE datasets, one we've obtained exclusively, that gives a fuller picture into the problem that the Trump administration said it would solve by these mass deportations when they came into office. In September, the ICE under the Biden administration told Congress there were over 400,000 immigrants at large that were not detained by ICE that had criminal convictions. And of those, 13,000 of those, over 13,000,  had known homicide convictions. At the time, then-candidate Trump seized on that and criticized the Biden administration for not doing more on immigration, and they continued to vow to go after the worst of the worst. Well, we understand that since that point, ICE has arrested over 185,000 immigrants. That includes some arrested under the Biden administration, but only 752 of those  had homicide convictions. In fact, only over 65,000 of those had any kind of serious criminal conviction, and that includes immigration violations and traffic violations. So what this data shows altogether is that if you're concerned about immigration as a national security or public safety threat,  It is actually not the vast arrest, the ones that we've seen across the country where people are being tackled to the ground, a lot of questions coming up now about ICE tactics. It's not clear that those tactics and the mass arrest and the increase in ICE enforcement is actually making a large dent when it comes to the numbers of known threats to ICE. And I talked to some ICE officials, current and former, about why that is. When we've seen so many people be arrested, ICE detention is at record capacity now, near 60,000 people.  even though they're only funded for $41,000. Why is it that more of these hardened criminals, known murderers, have not been arrested? And what I'm told is that it's much harder to find people who have committed crimes. And, in fact, some of the investigators from Homeland Security Investigations  have been pulled off those cases to go make arrests in the streets. They're getting the numbers up. As you know, Stephen Miller told ICE officials in mid-May to increase ICE arrest no matter who it was, not just going after people with criminal convictions. They've also made the argument that anyone in this country illegally is a criminal. Even if they cross the border illegally, if they no longer have legal status, they should be criminalized. But I think when you're able to look at these categories and see how many people were arrested by category,  It's worth having a conversation about whether or not the tactics are actually achieving the goal of going after the worst of the worst. And so simply what this data does is it holds the Trump administration accountable on a key campaign issue as we continue to see these arrests ramp up across the country and in many cases cause protests like the ones we're seeing in Los Angeles."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

Let me start with the thing that is, of course, in the news. What the President said going back 10 years, if you look at the campaign in 2015 and 2016, he said it consistently.  through his second term is that he does not want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple. It destabilizes the entire region. It gives this terrible regime leverage over the United States of America. As the president often jokes with me, everybody in Iran calls the Iranian leader the supreme leader. That's a pretty amazing title, if you think about it. But he looked at me in the situation room a few days ago, and he said, Mr. Vice President,  you don't have to call him the Supreme Leader, but you would if the guy had a nuclear weapon. Because the leverage that nuclear weapons give you to destabilize the world, to destroy our economic interests, to destroy our national security interests, you don't want the worst people in the world to have a nuclear weapon. So what did the President do? For 60 days, he negotiated aggressively to encourage that Iranian regime to give up those weapons peacefully. And by the way,  he was more than willing to accept a peaceful settlement to that problem. But again, this comes back to instincts. When the president realized that there was not going to be a peaceful settlement to that problem, he sent B-2 bombers and dropped 12 30,000 pound bombs on the worst facility and destroyed that program.  And I think there are a lot of Republicans, by the way, I count myself among them, who after the past 25 years, they don't want to get involved in another long-term, protracted Middle Eastern conflict. We all saw what happened with Iraq and Afghanistan. And so what I call the Trump doctrine is quite simple. Number one, you articulate a clear American interest. And that's, in this case, that Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. Number two, you try to aggressively, diplomatically solve that problem.  And number three, when you can't solve it diplomatically, you use overwhelming military power to solve it, and then you get the hell out of there before it ever becomes a protracted conflict. That is the Trump doctrine.  And to the Americans who are worried about this becoming a protracted conflict, I think the President solved that very quickly. Not only did we destroy the Iranian nuclear program, we did it with zero American casualties.

Yes, good afternoon. And we have just concluded the formal part of the NATO Summit in The Hague. Of course, there will be many other meetings later today, this afternoon. And together, Allies have laid the foundations for a stronger, fairer, and more lethal NATO.  NATO leaders agreed on the The Hague Defence Investment Plan. This will fuel a quantum leap in our collective defence. They agreed to boost our defence industries, which will not only increase our security, but will also create jobs. And we have reaffirmed our unwavering support for Ukraine.  All of this is crucial. It means that no matter the challenges we face, whether from Russia or terrorism, cyber attacks, sabotage or strategic competition, this Alliance is and will remain ready, willing and able to defend every inch of Allied territory and ensure that our one billion people can continue to live in freedom and security.  These decisions will have a profound impact on our ability to do what NATO was founded to do, deter and defend. And the key decision in that regard is to adopt the The Hague Defence Investment Plan. With this plan, Allies have agreed to invest 5% of GDP in defence. This is a significant commitment in response to significant threats to our security.  It includes at least 3.5% of GDP invested in core defence requirements, a benchmark that until today was set at 2%. A target that I am pleased to say all Allies will now meet this year or have already met. The 3.5% is to fund our militaries and the equipment they need, from our air defences to ammunition, drones, tanks, troops and more.  In addition to the 3.5 percent for core defense, the plan includes 1.5 percent of GDP that will go towards investments that support our defense and security. All to ensure we can effectively deter aggression and defend ourselves and each other should anyone make the mistake of attacking. Allies recognize the severity of the threats we face.  And in response, they have come together to agree an ambitious but essential new defence spending commitment. Our decisions today show, from the Mediterranean to the Arctic, from the west coast of North America to our eastern flank, all Allies are united in understanding that we need to step up to stay safe. And they are acting on it. President Trump has been clear.  America is committed to NATO. He affirmed that again today in no uncertain terms. At the same time, he made clear that America expects European allies and Canada to contribute more. And that is exactly what we see them doing. European allies and Canada will do more of the heavy lifting, equalizing their spending and taking greater responsibility for our shared security.  Of course, work does not stop here. This is day one. We now shift from agreeing on what we need to rolling up our sleeves and making this new plan a reality. And part of this requires that we rapidly expand our defence industrial capacity on both sides of the Atlantic. We need quality and quantity. We need to innovate and we need to act fast.  So we will continue our work to bring down barriers. We will leverage our partnerships with the European Union, with Ukraine and in the Inner Pacific to foster defence industrial cooperation. And there are major economic benefits, with the potential for literally millions of extra jobs across the Alliance. The decisions made today will make NATO much stronger.  They also make NATO a fairer alliance, with Europe and Canada stepping up and carrying their fair share of the responsibility for our shared security. The resolve of Allies is clear. We are in this together. Committed to Article 5. And we are determined to stand firm. No one should doubt our capacity or determination should our security be challenged.  This is the stronger, fairer, and more lethal alliance that NATO leaders have begun to build. Of course, this is also an alliance that stands firmly by our neighbour and partner, Ukraine. My dear friend Volodymyr Zelensky is here in The Hague with us at the NATO Summit along with his team. Our resounding message to him and the Ukrainian people is that Ukraine has our continued support.  including with over 35 billion euros pledged so far this year with more to follow. All of this, our aim is to keep Ukraine in the fight today so that it can enjoy a lasting peace in the future. We stand by Ukraine in its pursuit of peace and will continue to support Ukraine on its irreversible path to NATO membership. It has been a momentous meeting today  Leaders have agreed on a trajectory that will ensure we are able to safeguard our freedom and security well into the future. And with that, I'm happy to take your questions. MODERATOR All right. I will call on people, and please, if you could, state the outlet you're from, if I don't know that already."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 651.913, "text": "We'll start with Sky News.

Well, there are two issues to this and to the 5%. One is that there is this consistent ask from the U.S. \u2013 this started already with Eisenhower in the 1950s \u2013 for the Europeans and the Canadians to equalize with what the U.S. is spending. And now, finally, we are going to do that. But obviously, the 3.5 core spending and the total 5% is deeply rooted in the outcome of a process in NATO, the NATO defense planning process,  which has led to agreeing by the defense ministers two weeks ago on our targets. So what each country needs to do, when the call would come, if the call would come, we need you to help because there is an Article 5 situation. And we have calculated that to basically reach those targets, we need to spend 3.5% on core defense and of course the 1.5% on defense and security-related spending.  There is this U.S. request, please equalize, because it is not fair that we shoulder much more than the others are doing and that we are carrying more weight than the others are doing. And there is the issue of that it is really necessary because of the long-term threat by the Russians to the whole of the Euro-Atlantic area and also the other upcoming adversaries and, of course, the situation with China, where we see this  Impressive military buildup, so it is both true the u.s.

So I'm positive about that, optimistic, but I'm not going to make a concrete prediction. But let's, I mean, we can safely assume that the end result will be positive.  And of course, what we are doing here, we have to make sure that Ukraine can stay in the fight, that Ukraine has what it needs to be as strong as possible. But obviously, we are all also working on getting a peace deal done or a long-term ceasefire done. And then we have to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs.  to prevent Vladimir Putin from ever, ever trying this again in the future. And the first layer of that, making sure that Ukraine can defend itself post a peace deal slash a long-term ceasefire, obviously is also the support we are now providing to keep them in the fight  which has to do, of course, with training, it has to do with delivering military equipment, sort of commanding Wiesbaden, but also the various streams of money going into Ukraine, developing Ukrainians' defence industrial base, which still has about a 35 billion spare capacity.

And you see in all these countries, debates ongoing on  doing more where possible, but it is not up to me to advise them. Let me concentrate on the 32 and make sure that we do what we need to do. But I think that debate is taking place also in many countries outside NATO. Okay, I think we've just got time for a couple more questions. The center, fifth row, gentleman in the very center there."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 37, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1712.725, "text": " Yes, my name is Heikki Aytokoski. I'm from the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. Did you exchange views on Vladimir Putin? Mr. Trump seems to be in rather friendly terms with him. It would be interesting to hear what you talked about him."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1726.799, "text": " I've not changed my views on Vladimir Putin. I don't trust the guy and of course I had a lot of dealings with him personally when we had the terrible situation with flight MH17, the Malaysian airline flight MH17 being shot out of the air by Russia in July 2014. And Putin telling me that he was not present in the Donbass and that he had no dealings in Ukraine and this, that and the other. And this was, these were all lies. We know that.  Okay, for the sake of geographical diversity, all the way in the back, Telegraaf. I have two short questions for you, right here at the back. How do you think Vladimir Putin will look at this NATO summit in The Hague and the appointments being made between the eight NATO allies? The other question, completely different one, but how do you think  How big is the role of the Dutch King, Willem-Alexander, the Queen and also Amalia in organizing this NATO Summit and making it into a success? A big role. Last night was really amazing.  We are both Dutch and we can be very fortunate to have this royal family. Of course, they have that overview which many politicians who are there for one or two terms can never compete with. So we have a king here in the Netherlands who is now in that position for 12 years. And you sense that. I mean, the breadth, the benefits from which he is speaking.  including with the American president and other leaders, is really impressive. And I've seen the same before with his mother, Queen Beatrix. So that is one of the huge advantages of having a monarchy. And I would say, well, to your and my country, let's be happy and let's be glad and grateful that this family is willing to do that. On the other question, I mean, look what Putin achieved. He wanted to divide the West. And now Finland and Sweden have joined NATO.  He wanted to divide the West, and now we have committed to a 5% spending target. So he cannot be very happy. And he should not be very happy.  Thank you very much for this opportunity. So for the West Balkans, for the first time in a long time it hasn't been mentioned in the communique. What does it mean for our region? You yourself were several times talking about the importance of the region for the alliance. Why can't you tell us why it's not mentioned?  But again, this is not your traditional communique which you would see in the UN or in NATO in the past where you would have 60 pages, 90 paragraphs basically talking about the world from the birth of Jesus up to today and everything in between. I mean, that's dumb.  We try to focus \u2013 so we are still very much concerned. KFOR is there in Kosovo. EUFOR is there in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I was visiting the region, had extensive talks with the leadership in Bosnia, in Kosovo. I had a dinner in Brussels with the president of Serbia. So we are very much involved as NATO. The EU, of course, is very much involved. We closely coordinate with Caracalla and Ursula von der Leyen on the European side.  But what we really want to do here is not to recall all the language, like the irreversible path of Ukraine into NATO. It's still there, nothing changed. But really to focus on three core issues in five paragraphs. And one of the paragraphs is about the next meeting. So basically four paragraphs. And that is about, as you know, production, spending, and Ukraine. Okay, final question to the young reporters in the front. Yes.  We'll get a mic to you, just a moment. Thank you very much for this opportunity, Secretary General. We are the youth correspondents. Absolutely. And you are here now for two days and you'll be marvelous.  There's a lot happening in this world and many children worry about it. Do you think we children can also fight for peace or should we trust that you could bring peace to the world? Thank you. I cannot personally bring peace to the world, but what we can do collectively  is to make sure that we are so well prepared, we are so strong that nobody will ever attack us. So the best way to preserve your future and that our children can live in a democratic, free, open society where you can be who you want to be, think what you want, have free press,  What we basically have in the West, and let's be honest, it's fantastic, is to make sure that we spend enough on our defence, particularly if we know that we have some adversaries who are really trying to get at us. So that's the best way to preserve your future. That's what we try to do today, to make that commitment.  But you standing here is really touching. And we have seen each other for two days. We know each other for a longer time. I really want to thank you both. And in you, all the free press sitting in this room, for your fantastic work. And see you soon, in Brussels or elsewhere.

But the investment pledge includes a review of spending in 2029 to monitor progress and reassess the security threat posed by Russia.  The leaders also underlined their ironclad commitment to NATO's collective security guarantee, saying, quote, that an attack on one is an attack on all.

And when malls started to decline, so did Gap for many of the same reasons. Gap had grown really, really large at that point, and it had a lot of leases and a lot of sort of aging shopping centers across America.  And then you get the one-two punch of some regulatory changes in the mid-2000s that led in a lot of international fast fashion retailers, Zara, H&M, things like that. And then the internet gave people in virtually everywhere in America a much wider access to different types of clothing. So suddenly there was just a ton of cheap clothes everywhere. And the sort of gamut that Gap ran, which was cool,  jeans and t-shirts, people had caught on to it. People were imitating what they were doing. And so you combine that sort of like lease load and debt load that they had with all this new competition and these new retail channels and they just fell off."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 251.019, "text": "We're going to get to Richard Dixon and the task that he has set out for him and the obstacles he has ahead of him in a second.

And so the dust is settling. I mean, I even think about Levi's that has gone through a revival of sorts. I just bought a pair of Levi's. I haven't bought Levi's in such a long time.

Um, and just about getting settled.  bring in initiatives and then it's like gone right and you know the the trouble that gap has had with executives over the past 20 years mirrors a lot of the trouble that other sort of like great american companies have had in that period of time looking for people to bring in to like solve one problem while then  accidentally making another problem worse. So you bring in someone to deal with the debt load and deal with margin, and then they do that, but creativity sort of plummets. Then you bring someone in to deal with the sort of overabundance of leases and closed stores and streamline, and they do that, but then the quality of the clothes also goes down because they're streamlining the materials being used.  So you are sort of playing whack-a-mole with all of these different problems and when you are bringing on executives that are meant to deal with sort of like systemic issues or logistical issues or financial issues within a company,  In a company that sells aesthetics, that sells ideas, that sells coolness, that can be really, really difficult in the long term, unless you have a sort of rare type of person, and it's just hard to find that person."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 440.752, "text": "And you know, it's funny, as they've gone along, I think about, I don't know, when my daughter was young, or Gap Baby, and Gap Kids, it seemed super successful.

There's been all these side quests and boondoggles and sub-brands and things that just didn't work.  What has underwritten a lot of that for a long time is Old Navy.

And something that Dixon told us about, Lily Meyer was my co-reporter on the piece, he was like,  you know, he had this town hall when he first got there where he, you know, had a slide presentation put together of all the negative headlines about the company and got up in front of the company and was like, everybody knows what we should be doing, except us. And it's hard to say that they're wrong. It was sort of like, you know, this like huge legacy company had become like a little bit more abundant, a little bit complacent. And  sort of figuring out a way out of that psychologically, I think has been a big part of his tenure so far. And when you combine that with the sort of like long, unsexy work that has been going on, you know, under him, but also before him of cleaning up the company's debt, of cleaning up the discounting situation, because a big issue for Gap has been that they've trained their customers to expect everything to be 50% off all the time.

If he's released, then there's an ICE detainer on him. And by all accounts, there is going to be an effort by ICE to detain him and move quickly to deport him. It does become a question about how that happens, though.  Because while there's this understanding, oh, he's just going to be immediately deported today, not quite. He can be deported to another country, but there has to be a promise that he will not be sent back to El Salvador. Because remember, he does have protection going back to El Salvador. So it is an academic exercise. It's an interesting question. The federal government is charging with crimes. At the same time, ICE says they have an opportunity to deport him. Which is more important? What is the fate of Camargo Garcia?  It's a little undecided about this point. Which do they want to hold? Do they want to try him? Or do they want him out of the country?

They can appeal whatever the immigration judge ultimately decides. They can appeal it to an appellate level. They can also transfer it over to federal court.

Shares down a whopping 6% this morning and dropping as we speak. It is your biggest downside mover. Coming off a pretty scary warning from the shipper, basically saying that there are  tariffs coming, more tariffs coming, there's more pain ahead, and that is ultimately going to hit on demand. Remember, the context of this is crucial. We just heard from Jay Powell in the last 24 hours saying pretty much the exact same thing, that we don't see the data show up yet, but that pain is coming. That's something that FedEx really ran with in terms of that warning. They're actually saying the profit impact for their company, their bottom line, could be worse this quarter.  simply because of that trade war weighing on their business. Now, the pre-market, like I said, you started to see the shares pay, excuse me, pair a little bit of those losses, but still down almost 6% in the pre-market. Remember, this is a stock that has been down quite a bit this year. We're looking as much as 18%  They're also in the midst of a massive restructuring, a massive cost saving here as well, because FedEx and UPS are dealing with the loss of some crucial clients. FedEx famously losing the business of the United States Post Office, and UPS also losing some business when it comes to Amazon as well. So, these two companies have really been looking at digging into their cost savings. FedEx saying that this latest development on the tariff story is certainly not helping them, and the market is taking that at  Base value down about 6% like I said for FedEx, but we also have to get a quick check on UPS shares as well FDX is the ticker for FedEx UPS is also the ticker for UP for the company UPS naturally those shares down about 1% and I think this is really interesting These are two companies that move together in lockstep  And this morning you are, of course, seeing an outsized reaction in FedEx, but keep an eye at the open and see if UPS starts to show a little bit more of that pain. Just as we speak, we are now down about 1.4% on UPS shares in the pre-market, Nathan. So lots going on in the shipping space as well.  A couple of analyst upgrades that I want to put on your radar, though. To give you the negative, let me give you the positive here. Your biggest mover in the pre-market to the upside within the S&P 500 is actually Coinbase, which has been having a pretty decent streak this morning. COIN is your ticker, higher by about 3%, trading at $354 a share. Looks like they're getting a price target boost over at Bernstein.  $310 a share to $510 a share. Staking with their outperform rating. That is a pretty big boost. And we should remember, Coinbase also got a boost in terms of the last couple of days when you start to get a bit of a green light from stable coin legislation out of Washington, D.C. So that has been a positive for the cryptocurrency exchange. Nathan, a little bit of a throwback, because I know you love those.

We meet at a dangerous moment for our one billion citizens.  Russia's war against Ukraine rages on. An assertive grouping of adversaries seeks to divide and challenge us. There's war in the Middle East. Terrorism poses a persistent threat. And new technologies bring opportunities, but also many serious security challenges. In the face of this, we stand together, united in NATO, the most powerful defensive alliance in world history.  History has shown that North America and Europe working together is a winning combination. Our adversaries know this. Our enduring commitment to Article 5, that an attack on one is an attack on all, sends a powerful message. In this meeting, we will take historic, transformational decisions to make our people safer through a stronger, fairer, and more lethal NATO.  To make NATO stronger, we have a concrete plan for all Allies to spend 5% of GDP on defence. It will go towards core defence, as well as defence and security-related investments. This decision is deeply rooted in our core mission and is required to resource our plans and readiness. This will also make NATO fairer, to ensure anyone and everyone contributes their fair share for our security.  For too long, one ally, the United States, carried too much of the burden of that commitment. And that changes today. President Trump, dear Donald, you made this change possible. Your leadership on this has already produced one trillion dollars in extra spending from European allies since 2016.  And the decisions today will produce trillions more for our common defense to make us stronger and fairer by equalizing spending between America and America's allies. Allies will also agree to further increase defense production so that our armed forces have everything they need. That means a huge expansion of our defense industrial base on both sides of the Atlantic.  That's good for our security, it's good for our economies and good for our jobs. Our decisions include continuing our support to Ukraine, while also pushing for a just and lasting peace. We all want the bloodshed to stop. We call on Russia to end its aggression against Ukraine.  Let me now turn to Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Dick Schoof, whose government and people are graciously hosting us here. Thank you to the media for joining us. We will continue our discussions in just a moment.

And we are honored to have you here in this city. It has been speaking in the language of peace and justice ever since the first Hague Peace Conference was held in 1899. I'm convinced that after today, the Hague will also be known as a city of collective purpose, unity, and resolve. After all, we are about to write history.  We are about to make decisions leading to an unprecedented increase in our collective defense spending and a new financial balance in our alliance. Both are urgent, both are necessary, and both will help make our transatlantic bond even stronger, so we can do justice to our founding principles of democracy, liberty, and the rule of law, as laid down in the Washington Treaty.  The last NATO event held in The Hague was a foreign minister meeting in 1989, just as Iron Curtain was beginning to break apart on the eve of the Cold War's end. And for a period, we hoped and believed that relations with Russia would continue to thaw. But the end of history turned out to be an illusion. An illusion that was shattered for good when Russia brutally invaded Ukraine.  So today there is a renewed awareness in our ranks that peace cannot be taken for granted. That it must be protected constantly and with conviction. And yes, peace comes at a cost. We must act on this swiftly and decisively.

It used to control with OPEC and managed to a great extent under the Biden administration, energy prices, its principal source of revenue. On the same time, Beijing was a huge customer of the Middle East. Half of its oil  was coming from the Middle East, 90 percent of Iran's exports, and now the Middle East is under new management, essentially the constellation of U.S.-led partners and allies rather than Tehran. And that sends important signals. And then the use of force. President Trump has reasserted again that he is willing to apply all instruments of national power to pursue U.S. interests.

His team at the Institute for Science and International Security just released its own report on the damage. And we're going to have the opportunity to speak to him right now. Welcome.

But when you look at these leaks, in this case from DIA, you have to ask, what is set back?  And I think what gets lost in this is that the job isn't completely done. I mean, you can only do so much with bombing. And you have to assess honestly that there are remaining stocks of 60% in vegetarian. We don't know how much is remaining or how much is in the rubble.  buried in collapsed buildings or in Fordow. And there's remaining centrifuges that hadn't been deployed, but were able to be deployed. And they could be deployed anywhere. It could be a warehouse in Tehran. It doesn't have to be at a third enrichment site that Iran has declared. So, you have to have a mechanism to get this. And so I would argue that this isn't over. And what I would hope would happen is that President Trump  does what he said he will do, is to get a deal with Iran to end its enrichment program and to do it in a verifiable manner. And in that process, Iran would have to produce these stocks, the remaining centrifuges, and get rid of them. And so that's what the Trump administration has promised. Now, I always \u2014 I find these  this battle taking Trump, where you take Trump literally, and then you just have to debunk a little bit, very corrosive to trying to find a solution to this problem, which is a fundamental security problem to the United States.

What we found at Fordow is we have building designs for Fordow from previous or other work we do. And we could geolocate what parts of the site were being targeted. So there's a very important ventilation shaft that comes up from the bottom, from the floor of the centrifuge plant all the way up to the surface.  The three holes for the mops are right in that ventilation shaft area or ventilation system, so it's kind of a clean shot all the way to the bottom. You're not going through a mountain, per se. We also found that the other three were targeted at the end of the centrifuge hall, going through an older structure that had been on the surface and that Iran had covered up back many years ago.  So we think that's a vulnerability in the mountain. And so if these mobs got through, what they're doing is if they explode, they're creating shockwaves that run throughout the complex from two different directions.

I keep moving around. Well, let's talk about debt. Republicans have become the kings of deficit and debt creation. Afghanistan war, Iraq war, the Bush tax cuts, the Trump 1 tax cuts, now the Trump 2 tax cuts. But it's not just legislation in which they have driven up the deficits and the debt, it's also by  modifying and undermining the structure of the process that was designed to control debt, specifically the 1974 Budget and Impoundment Act. It was two decades and two years after that bill passed, Republicans said, well, this bill, it was only for deficit reduction, but we're going to use it for tax cuts that drive up the deficit. Well, that was huge damage to the ability of Congress  to make sure that we had a special pathway for reducing deficits.  Instead, they turned it into a pathway for increasing them, and increasing them massively. And now we have the Republicans saying, well, there are two things that survived our 1996 massacre of the 1974 Act, and that was there could be no deficits after 10 years, and we'd continue to use honest numbers, honest numbers from the Joint Committee on Taxation, honest numbers from the Congressional Budget Office. But now,  The Republicans in the Senate are saying, let's get rid of both of those forms of discipline as well. There is a provision in section 313 that says, absolutely there can be no deficit creation after the budget window for the reconciliation bill. That's a 10-year window. But, Republicans are, speaking of windows, they're throwing that out the window.  And the process was designed to create this new organization, Congressional Budget Office, to give us honest numbers. Quit lying to ourselves. Quit lying to the American people about what things cost. Get rid of the smoke and mirrors. That was a form of discipline that is also being thrown out with this so-called current  policy baseline. Now that strategy, invented out of thin air by the Republicans, comes from Section 312. So I just want to encourage you all to be a little bit educated about Section 312.  This is the history of Section 312. One good turn deserves another. Oh, thank you very much. Section 312 has always been used only on a bipartisan basis. Section 312 has only been used on very narrow provisions. Section 312 has always been resolved in that bipartisan way to resolve a small ambiguity. And it has never, ever been used in reconciliation.  because 312 wasn't about reconciliation. Section 313 is about reconciliation. Thank you very much. You did that really well. And so let's turn to section 313 and what does it say? It has five provisions that say or five elements that say look at each provision and find out how much it changes revenue or how much it changes costs. This is the 313.  I've circled a whole bunch of things here. It says, check this provision. In other words, check what the proposed law is, each provision, find out how much it costs or how much revenue it produces or decreases. And how do you do that? You say, here's the provision, versus if the provision wasn't there. What is that? That is a comparison to current law.  Let me be absolutely clear. Section 312 has no role in reconciliation. It's being used completely out of place, and it's inherently inconsistent. Let me give you two examples. In the middle of the 10-year window, Republicans are stopping some tax provisions.  under their theory of current policy, you would continue to cost those out over the 10-year period because you're assuming that they go on after they are dying in law. So they're saying, well, provisions that were in previous law, we're assuming those continue forever, even though the law says they don't. And then they're saying provisions that we're creating and saying, stop, actually stop.  Totally inconsistent. Or look at another inconsistency. Look at that $5 trillion debt ceiling increase they're putting in. Why is that there? Because the bill increases the debt massively over the couple coming years. So, just really want to say we are going to contest the obliteration of fiscal discipline.  We are tired of hearing Republicans say they are champions of fiscal responsibility when they do legislation after legislation that drives us into massive deficit and debts, and then proceed to dismantle the bipartisan structure that was designed to create discipline over the budgeting process. Thank you, Jeff. I just want to show everyone how diligent he is. Look at this. Questions? Stop yelling.

And I'm going to be honest. In terms of not reading the room, this meeting takes the cake. You guys run this place. You could scrap the agenda right now, and we could debate President Trump's dangerous escalation going on in the Middle East. And instead of that, we get business as usual from Republicans. And it's unbelievable.  We should be debating, right this second, debating what is happening with Iran. You guys should have the courage to come here, to explain what is going on, to justify what's going on to the American people and what this president is doing. This president, by the way, who said he wanted no more wars, who called his opponent a warmonger, who ran for office on lower food prices,  Well, six months in, and guess what? Food prices haven't gone down, but here we are. And Trump is launching missiles against Iran. I mean, talk about a bait and switch. Not only are we not talking about a War Powers Resolution right now, media reports say that Republicans are discussing rigging the rules to prevent Congress from having any debate at all. I hear you guys are considering deprivileging a War Powers Resolution to stop us from having a vote.  on having a debate. I mean, I think that's just pathetic. I really think it's cowardly. These strikes were illegal, illegal and unconstitutional. There was no congressional authorization, no authority, and I have seen zero evidence that this was done to prevent some imminent impending attack. This was a war of Donald Trump's own choice. Donald Trump woke up and decided to bomb Iran, so here we are. And let's just be clear. None of us want Iran to have a weapon of mass destruction.  But I'm old enough to remember the last time a president used vague and shifting claims about weapons of mass destruction, dragging us into a war in the Middle East. Does anyone else remember that? Iraq? Trillions of dollars, thousands of lives lost, and here we are again. This isn't history rhyming or even repeating. This is like copy and paste. We've got top administration officials denying Iran is close to a nuclear weapon and then changing their tune a day later.  We've got a president escalating the rhetoric and talking now about regime change. Iran is threatening to shut down the Strait of Hormuz. And if they do, gas prices will skyrocket, so much for lowering costs. And let me just also say, I and many others in this body have consistently opposed unauthorized military action, no matter who is in the White House.  Speaker Johnson said earlier that he, I quote, never heard a Democrat balk, end quote, when President Biden or Obama used the military without approval. Well, he obviously wasn't listening, because I balked. I balked, and so did a lot of other Democrats. And frankly, I really resent the implication that this is all some political game.  I opposed President Obama's actions in Libya. I criticized his escalation in Afghanistan. I held President Biden to the same standard when it came to Yemen. I have been consistent on this issue, and so have many other Democrats and many Republicans as well, to be frank. So this isn't partisan. It is about our responsibility to the American people. And I have the receipts here of all the times that I have questioned the actions of both President Obama and President Biden.  But this is about our responsibility to the American people. And if we're going to spend their tax money dropping bombs on another country, if we're going to put their sons and daughters in harm's way, the least we can do is have the courage to debate it and to vote on it. If you think Americans want another endless war in the Middle East, go ahead and vote for one. But I want to know why Republicans don't want to have that debate, especially while American troops are being put in harm's way.  because of this president's reckless and unconstitutional strikes. And let's not get started on the Republicans' horrific tax scam bill that's working its way through the Senate, which is going to rip food off the tables of hungry kids and seniors and kick millions off their health care and gut programs like Medicaid and Medicare. Republicans are happily ripping basic assistance programs from regular folks so they can give even more tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy and their billionaire donors, while also adding  trillions to our debt. Once again, this committee is doing a disservice to the American people. No president, Democrat or Republican, has the authority to bomb a sovereign nation without congressional approval, period. The Constitution gives that power exclusively to Congress, and I'll be damned if I sit back while Donald Trump drags us into another endless war. And shame on this committee and this body if we don't bring up a War Powers Resolution and have an up or down vote on this issue.  We need to restore Congress as a co-equal branch of government. And I'm proud to co-sponsor the War Powers Resolution of my Republican colleague, Mr. Massey, who used to be on this committee, to stop this from going any further. And again, Speaker Johnson, this is not all politics. Many of us have consistently spoken up about this for years because the American people do not want us dragged into another endless war. We need to do our jobs.  And before this goes any further, we need to have a thoughtful debate. We need to ask the questions. And we need to get this right. And we need to have a vote. So I thank our witnesses for being here. I just wish that they were here on the most pressing issue that is before our nation and the world at this moment. But we're not. And with that, Madam Chair, I yield back. Yeah, happy to.  Can you give me the time back?

From the Committee on Homeland Security, your full statement will be submitted for the record, and we ask that you summarize your statement in five minutes. Representative Green, you are now recognized for your testimony."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 21.157, "text": "Thank you.  Thank you, Chairwoman Fox. I'm here today to speak in favor of my bill, the Special Interest Alien Reporting Act of 2025, an essential piece of border security transparency legislation. My bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to publicly release monthly reports on the number of special interest aliens  encountered, their countries of origin, and where they were encountered. A special interest alien, or SIA, is a non-U.S. person who, based on a DHS analysis of travel patterns, may pose a national security risk to the United States or its interests.  Currently, DHS does not report on this data. Instead, we have been left only with random, incomplete announcements of moment-in-time numbers by DHS officials or leaks to the media. The Biden-Harris administration's disastrous policies place the United States in an extremely vulnerable national security position. Over the past four years, Customs and Border Protection faced  an unprecedented number of special interest aliens from 26 countries that the Department of Homeland Security has determined pose the greatest national security and counterintelligence threats. Those encountered included individuals from adversarial nations, including the People's Republic of China,  Iran, Afghanistan, and Syria. The Biden-Harris administration intentional disregard for our laws and breakdown of national security resulted in U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountering over 1.7 million special interest aliens, a staggering number. Many of these individuals were swiftly processed and released into the interior under the Biden-Harris administration's catch and release policies.  Given ongoing events in the Middle East, this legislation is essential for Congress to conduct congressional oversight of the executive branch. Given the fact that we have been warned of a potential attack on our homeland by Iran or their terrorist proxies mean that American people should have transparency of special interest aliens coming across our border or who did come across our border the last four years.  During the Biden-Harris administration, the Border Patrol apprehended over 1,500 Iranian nationals illegally crossing the southwest border between ports of entry. Of those, Biden and Harris admitted 729\u2014that's almost half of those from Iran\u2014into the United States. And we have no idea how many are still at large today. And guess what?  We only just now are getting that number because CBP just disclosed it to Fox News, Bill Mlugen, who posted it on his social media. That's not how this should work. With Iran threatening Americans with retaliatory attacks on our homeland, President Biden and Vice President Harris, his border czar, created an opportunity for our adversaries to gain access  to our nation and wreak havoc when called upon. The Biden-Harris administration welcomed these potential national security risks into our country, including through illegal parole programs they started, such as the CBP-1 app, to facilitate their quick release into the United States. Parents don't let bad guys or potentially bad guys into their homes with their children. These people should have never been released into our country.  Under Biden and Harris, our sovereign borders became revolving doors for illegal aliens, including an untold number of bad actors intent on causing mayhem and harm to innocent people. CBP already publicly reports statistics relating to individuals on the terrorist screening data set who attempt to illegally cross our borders, but they do not release statistics on special interest aliens. The American people deserve to see the data.  Similar to the information on the terrorist screening data set, releasing encounter statistics on special interest aliens would not include sensitive information, but general encounter information, which increases the transparency and accountability that are critical to the health of our constitutional republican.  After all, it's the American people that pay for the government because they're the taxpayers. They deserve to know. The legislation would show the American people the contrast between open borders and secure borders. It would require DHS to publish the monthly SIA numbers going all the way back to early 2021 when Biden and Harris took office. They will also provide Congress with necessary context to conduct oversight of future administrations.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important piece of legislation to increase our national security and transparency for the American people, whom we all swore an oath to serve and protect. Thank you, and I yield back."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 335.576, "text": "The gentlelady yields back.

Chairwoman Fox and Ranking Member McGovern and members of the committee,  Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Tipping Off Terrorist Act. Although well-intentioned, this bill compromises national security. It's the bottom line. This bill requires Customs and Border Protection, CBP, to publish sensitive data on national security information on a monthly basis, essentially giving the bad guys information to do a better job of penetrating our defenses.  But let's look at the big picture. Special Interest Alien, or SIA, just means that someone's travel patterns indicate a need for further scrutiny. It does not mean someone's a terrorist or out to do harm at all. During their committee markup, my colleagues on the Republican side claimed that this bill only required CBP to publish the total number of SIAs that are encountered while trying to enter the country illegally.  If that were the case, I would support this legislation. But that is not the case. Greater transparency and accountability, Department of Homeland Security is important. Public needs it, but it should not be done at the expense of compromising our national security, which is exactly what this bill does. As the bill reads, it would also require CBP to publicly identify  each SIA nationality, country of last residence, and the geographic location that the encounter was made, and whether the encounter was made at a port of entry or in the interior of the United States. By publishing this information in real time, bad actors will be able to tell who is getting advanced screening from CBP and which locations have been most successful in interdicting these immigrants. The bad guys will use this information  to adjust their operations to try and avoid extra screening, which only hurts our national security. And please note that DHS has never publicly released these numbers on a real-time basis because the numbers could give away sensitive information. And please note today, there is nothing to stop DHS or Secretary Nome from publishing these numbers. Instead of  addressing this bill on the floor. I asked the author of this legislation to work with DHS to get such information published or made available to the public in a way that DHS considers safe. I would ask the author of this bill to talk to the Secretary of Homeland Security and come up with a structure to publish this information that DHS would not deem harmful to our national security."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 521.333, "text": " Thank you, Mr. Chair."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 546.595, "text": " What my bill would do is provide transparency for the American people on the DHS website.

I hope that the Secretary will publish it if this law passes or not, and I hope the law passes because I hope whoever the next Secretary is  will have to publish it.

I think it's probably up a little more than that.  and the demand for gold will likely continue. And so a proxy for that in the equity space is a miner like Barrick Mining. But the broader story here is also that this is a company that has been beaten down actually for a while. It is very well priced, while the rest of the S&P 500 is not. And if you think about where we are and what happens with tariffs,  Margins are not exactly back to normal. We're just recovering still under long-term averages for margins.

He said, yeah, recent economic data would have likely justified some cuts.  good cuts, I think, because of inflation, not necessarily because of bad reasons for weakness. However, higher tariffs might derail the Fed's fight against inflation. So it's all about whether you believe, and not everyone does, it's whether you believe that tariffs could sort of be a  self-replicating problem instead of a one-shot deal.

And Chair Powell did a great job at last week's press conference from the FOMC laying out, at this point, we don't know who's going to pay it, if anyone's going to pay it, how it's going to filter through the system.  And that said, the economic data, they feel, gives the\u2014in aggregate, they feel, even though there's some dissension on the committee right now, they feel that they have enough room to be able to be patient and let this play out.

You're going to be late, and you're just going to be cutting after there's already a problem. But I guess we haven't seen any, necessarily any signs that there is weakness at this point.

He highlights that the demand for AI talent far outstrips supply, driving up prices and forcing companies to offer comprehensive packages.

All right, coming back from space, right back down to Washington, Karen. Fed Chair Jay Powell is getting ready to resume testimony on Capitol Hill later this morning. He will appear before the Senate Banking Committee. Yesterday at House Financial Services, Chairman Powell said he is still in no rush to cut interest rates while the central bank waits to see how tariffs affect the economy. Increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity. The effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level.  In remarks heard live on Bloomberg, Fed Chair Jay Powell suggested if inflation pressures remain contained, the Fed could cut rates sooner rather than later. But Powell would not point to a particular meeting. Nathan, shares of FedEx, they're down about 6% this morning. The delivery package company forecast a worse than expected profit for the current quarter, although it typically provides a full year forecast. FedEx said it would only share its outlook for the current quarter due to the uncertain global demand environment.  And repeating our top story this morning, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has conceded to upstart rival Zoran Mamdani in the Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. The 33-year-old Queens lawmaker racked up commanding leads across Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. Results aren't official yet under the city's ranked choice system. A candidate is declared the winner after receiving more than 50% of the vote. In each round, a candidate will be eliminated. Voters' number two choice will be distributed to the remaining candidates. And that process is repeated.  until a candidate receives a majority. It's time now for a look at some of the other stories making news in New York and around the world. And for that, we're joined by Bloomberg's Michael Barr. Michael, good morning. Good morning, Karen. There's a bit of relief ahead today from the extreme heat gripping much of the country. Parts of the Midwest will see cooler temperatures, but it will be another brutally hot day in the Northeast. Bloomberg meteorologist Rob Carolin has the latest.  Michael, high pressure will continue to produce hot weather today, just not the excesses of we saw yesterday. We had temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in the New York City area in Washington in the Boston area. In fact, Boston has set their all time record high yesterday for June at 102, fourth warmest day there in southern New England. Looks like the high is beginning to weaken, so temperatures are hot today but not as hot as yesterday. We have heat advisories in effect from parts of southern New England through the New York City area all the way down into the mid Atlantic states. Good news is the northeast will be much cooler tomorrow, Michael.  Thank you very much, Rob. Court resumes today in the sex trafficking case against music mogul Sean Diddy Combs when his attorneys have a sit-down with the judge on jury instructions. Both the defense and the prosecution rested their cases. After closing arguments, deliberations could begin as soon as Friday.  The NTSB criticizing Boeing, its subcontractors, Spirit Aerosystems, and the FAA for that terrifying Alaska Airlines flight when a door plug flew off in mid-flight. Miraculously, all 177 people on board survived.  The NTSB preliminary report revealing Boeing employees felt pressure to work too fast, making it difficult to avoid mistakes. NTSB Chair Jennifer Hominy credits the fast-acting crew of Alaska Flight 1282.  An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures. And yet the crew shouldn't have had to be heroes. Because this accident never should have happened. NTSB Chair Jennifer Hominy says the finalized report will be available in several weeks.

Imam Dhani is a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist Assembly member from Queens, and he's now on track to become the Democratic nominee for mayor. He won 43.5% of the first-choice votes, to Andrew Cuomo's 36.3%. And while we're still waiting for the final ranked-choice results, which will be released on July 1st,  You know, Cuomo conceded last night to this primary, which tells you everything you need to know about how this is really going to end. Mamdani pulled this off with a combination of message, movement, and method. He ran on affordability, freezing rents, free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and connected with young voters, immigrant communities, and the city's growing progressive base. His campaign had 50,000 volunteers. Nathan, I'll tell you this.  You know, there was a day that I went with my wife and son and my brother-in-law and his kids to, you know, a local bar in Brooklyn.

That cross endorsement with the Working Families Party  where Tish James stood on that stage with the person she primarily endorsed and said, rank this slate, that played a big role. But there is also a push in New York City for folks to have affordability. They did not feel that Andrew Cuomo's comeback would get them to that place. Cuomo had money, $25 million in Super PAC money, but he was extremely negative in his ads. There were some ads that really stoked at fears of New Yorkers.  There was a push to call Mamdani an anti-Semite when he's always said for years and for the months of this campaign that he is not an anti-Semite, he just is pro-Palestine and he does want to work with  with Jewish New Yorkers and have a New York that makes them feel safe. But he offered something different. Urgency, optimism and a break from the old guard. And Cuomo still carried the weight of unresolved scandals. His resignation, the nursing home deaths, allegations of sexual harassment and questions about transparency during COVID.  And it's clear that voters didn't forget. They said, let's go with this new guy, even though he's only passed three bills in the legislature, even though he only has a staff of five. Let's see if this is a guy who gets forward.

So, you know, I've been covering this story with Laura Lamias, who's our senior reporter covering New York. And we talked about this a couple of days ago. You know, is Cuomo too embarrassed to have, you know, on July 1st, if he's if he's truly lost a Democratic primary, is he too embarrassed to run on that independent line because he didn't get the support of Democrats?  and this is a guy who has been an establishment Democrat over the last 30 years. He's on the independent line, but last night he signaled that he might not use it. He told reporters last night, tonight was not our night. Does that mean that it's not our night? Is it a firm no? We don't know. It's a big shift from the assumption that he was gonna keep going no matter what. But this now tells me that this is going to be a race between Eric Adams, who is still mayor, and Zoran Mamdani.  Adams, of course, skipped a Democratic primary entirely, planning to run on that stop antisemitism line. It gives him a second shot and he's politically vulnerable, but can he have the groundswell of support in the black community that Cuomo took away? Can he have the groundswell of support from Republicans who seem to like what he's done? And so this could be a two-way race. I think what will happen is that they'll find a way to push Curtis Lewa  off the ballot and give Adams that Republican line, and then will those center-right Democrats, Caribbean folks, the people I grew up with, who may not know Mamdani, go for the name they know, which is Eric Adams.

For more, we're joined by Bloomberg News Senior Editor Bill Ferries. Bill, good morning. What do we know about what this initial Pentagon assessment actually says? Good morning.  Good morning, Nathan. So, yes, there's this initial assessment out from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, and it basically says that that surprise bombing attack by those B-2s over the weekend likely did not cripple Iran's\u2014the core components of Iran's nuclear program that were buried deep  Now, it's clear the entrances have been completely destroyed and covered up, but their initial assessment is that, deep down, those centrifuges may still be there. Iran may be able to dig through the rubble and get back down into those areas.  So obviously that would be a very disappointing outcome for the U.S. President Trump authorized this extremely risky mission with these stealth bombers flying 37 hours around the world to make this, to bomb those sites. And there's still a lot more information that will probably come out, a lot more intelligence assessments that need to be done. But the president and his aides pushing back already on this defense, this Pentagon Intelligence Agency report saying that  that it's clear to them that the sites were destroyed and that Iran's nuclear program is stopped. And to that point, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also at the NATO summit saying that the report was preliminary and low confidence saying that the leak of this assessment is going to be investigated. How is the effort going to get UN nuclear inspectors back in the region now that a ceasefire is in effect?  Well, that's the priority for the International Atomic Energy Agency. They have said that they think the atomic program has been set back significantly, but they wouldn't say whether that means months or years. They want to get in as soon as possible to see what is the status of that enriched uranium. Is it still at one of those sites that got bombed, or can they figure out whether it got moved in the days or weeks before the attack?  The IAEA's priority is just to get boots on the ground, basically, and start seeing what they can learn about the status of that program. Yeah, and I guess it can't really be disputed that Iran is on a back foot following all these developments. What can we expect when it comes to the possibility of further talks around the nuclear program between Iran and the U.S. ?  Well, it does seem that both Iran and Israel were ready to de-escalate at some level. They did both agree to at least that temporary ceasefire. It had a rough start, but it seems to be holding. That may bode well for Iran's willingness to sit down again with the U.S. and Oman, maybe through mediators, but start talking about what they can do to scale back their nuclear program.  You know, those are still going to be difficult negotiations, but it does seem the fact that the ceasefire is holding probably is good news for the negotiating teams.

The Russians did build their nuclear power plant for civilian use at Bushehr.

Where's Jeff? Right here, good. Thanks Jeff for joining us today. Well, one thing has become clear. The more Americans learn about this big ugly bill, the more they hate it. We just saw polling data in our caucus  that showed two-to-one people don't like the bill, a majority of Democrats, of course, but a significant majority of Independents, and a significant chunk of Republicans. Our Republican colleagues are also starting to see how devastating this bill is. Look no further than my good friend, Senator Tillis.  So this is a chart that he gave out in his caucus according to Punchbowl. He handed out this sheet that says exactly what's in the bill. Thanks, Jeff.  how much you lose with the provider rate tax, each state. Louisiana, $20 billion. South Carolina, $20 billion. Tennessee, $16 billion. Kentucky, $12 billion. Ohio, $8.4. West Virginia, $6.2. Missouri, $6.1. And Iowa, $4.1. And North Carolina, $38 billion. That's a lot of money for anybody.  In the caucus, he's handing this out. Republicans are really beginning to learn how bad the big ugly bill is for them. Tillis is actually is right. I agree with him. Okay. It'd be catastrophic for North Carolina with Medicaid coverage at risk for over 600,000 people and forfeiting over $38 billion to his home state. And he's not the only one. Republican senators are erring.  deep concerns behind closed doors, but they're not being honest at home to their constituents. Senate Republicans should listen to Senator Tillis. He's right about how devastating this would be. Republicans might not want to be honest with the American people in public, but Democrats sure as hell will be now and throughout the summer and on into next year. Senate Democrats have been beating the drum  doing our best to reveal exactly what the bill does. And the more we learn about the bill, the more awful it is. And the more awful it is, the harder we fight. And we know the American people are on our side. So we know just letting them know what's in the bill is very bad for them and shows what we are for. Republicans know that their plan is a debt buster, but they don't seem to care.  They're lining the pockets of their billionaire buddies, pretending it won't cost billions, trillions rather, by using a budget gimmick. And all it is is a gimmick, current policy baseline. They can deceive all they want. Everyone knows you can push the paper around, but they're actually putting the country in debt with these tax cuts. There's less money in the coffers when they cut the taxes, plain and simple.  They know that, but the debt has a real effect on the American people. Costs will go up everywhere. The cost to buy a car, the cost to start a business, the cost to buy a home, the cost to retain some debt on your credit card bills. Americans are going to be hit hard by the deficit increase alone, and that won't change no matter how the Republicans paper it over.  with this gimmick called current policy baseline. So it's evasive. Now, finally, I want to emphasize how utterly outrageous it was for the administration to cancel, to cancel the briefing that we were supposed to get at four o'clock today. The last minute postponement was just a dereliction of their duty  to let the Congress know, to let both parties know in the Congress what's going on over there. So what's the administration so afraid of that they don't want to brief us? They keep delaying it. I asked for this briefing last week. It was scheduled last week before United States action in Iran and here all of a sudden they cancel it. Now they say they want to wait to have Rubio and Hegseth there. Rubio and Hegseth were never scheduled and frankly  They want to do that Thursday? That's fine, but it should not be a substitute for this serious briefing, but an addition. And we know what will happen. Hegseth and even Rubio will give us a lot of happy talk, but not the sinew, the details that we need. The people coming today, including Major General Cain, he's known as a straight shooter, would have given us the details we need to know.  We don't need some canned talk points for Pete Hexeth to roll out. If secretaries in Rubio, as I said, want to come, that's fine. But what happened today was obstruction that undermines the very principles of democracy. Okay? Where is Leader Thune and the Republicans? Why are they not defending the very right and obligation of senators, both Democrat and Republican?  To be informed, what the heck is going on? They are just out of control, violating every precept, every principle, every law, unlike any other administration in American history.

When you became president in 2016, 2017, you forced Europeans and Canadians to pay more. At this moment,  trillion extra aggregate defence spending by the Canadians and the Europeans. Then came phase two, when you became president in January of last year. Phase two is that all other countries, not yet on 2%, have now committed to the 2%. This is the old goal from Wales in 2014. Seven were not on 2%, some were saying somewhere in the 2030s, now this year.  all of them, including Canada, including Italy, including Belgium, they have all now committed to the 2%. And now comes the big splash. Today, we will decide to go to 5%. We have to keep ourselves safe from our adversaries, but also because it is fair to equalize with the United States.  With this 5%, the Europeans and the Canadians will equalize their defense spending with the United States. So this is not about American taxpayers paying more. This is about Europeans, Canadians paying more. And again, this would not have happened. I'm really saying this here. And some people might criticize me.

Some are saying somewhere in the 2030s, now this year.  all of them, including Canada, including Italy, including Belgium, they have all now committed to the 2 percent. And now comes the big splash. Today, we will decide to go to 5 percent. We have to keep ourselves safe from our adversaries, but also because it is fair to equalize with the United States.

So there are headlines out around the company, potentially in a bit of a storm around compliance with some of its accounting regulations. Now, this is a company that isn't actually afraid of a bit of a bit of controversy. There was some controversy a few years ago around their accounting and around a short report, that kind of thing.

They are trying to stick to the regulation and also not risk to breach some of these regulations. So essentially, they are complying with the stock.

Phase two is that all the countries not yet on 2% have now committed to the 2%. This is the old goal from Wales in 2014. Seven were not on 2%. Some are saying somewhere in the 2030s, now this year.  All of them, including Canada, including Italy, including Belgium, they have all now committed to the 2%. And now comes the big splash. Today, we will decide to go to 5%. We have to keep ourselves safe from our adversaries, but also because it is fair to equalize with the United States.  With this 5%, the Europeans and the Canadians will equalize their defense spending with the United States. So this is not about American taxpayers paying more. This is about Europeans, Canadians paying more. And again, this would not have happened. I'm really saying this here. And some people might criticize me.

Having a job gives individuals purpose and dignity. We should promote policies lifting people out of poverty. In the 1990s, we passed welfare reform with a Republican Congress and a Democrat president. The results, welfare rolls went down, poverty rates decreased,  employment and earnings increased. Establishing work requirements in Medicaid for able-bodied adults with reasonable exemptions, then from the previous precedent of welfare reform, that all makes common sense yet today. States like Iowa are already leading the way in establishing work requirements.  for able-bodied adults in Medicaid, Iowa's Governor Reynolds has said, quote, if you're an able-bodied adult who can work, you should work. We're doing the same thing at the national level. Work requirements under the one big, beautiful bill only applies to able-bodied adults between the ages of 19 and 64.  Individuals will have to complete a minimum of 80 hours of work a month or about 20 hours a week of qualifying community engagement activities like working, job training, going to school, volunteering, or a combination of all these.  We have reasonable exemptions for veterans with disability rated as total, individuals who are medically frail or otherwise have special medical needs, individuals who are blind, have substance abuse disorder, a disabling mental disorder,  physical or intellectual disability that significantly impairs their ability to perform one or more activities of daily living or serious complex medical conditions. We also have exemptions for parents, guardians, and caretakers relative of children age 14 or under or disabled individuals.  foster care youth through the age of 26. We give good cause exemptions for short-term hardships like hospitalizations or for an individual receiving psychiatric care. Individuals impacted by a natural disaster living in high unemployment areas or having to travel outside their community for an extended period of time to receive medical service  would also be exempted. Now states will obviously be required to establish streamlined process and use reliable data like payroll data to avoid individuals submitting their own documentations. There will also be significant outreach and education to those who will be required to work.  Labor force participation data for prime age men, 25 to 54, indicates that between 1950 to 1970, less than one in 30 were out of the labor force. Now, it's surprise, maybe it shouldn't be surprising. Since then, participation declined steadily.  so that 1 in 30 figure is now 1 in 10. This represents nearly 7 million prime age men absent from the workforce. On top of this, recent research found that non-working Medicaid recipients spend six hours a day on socializing, relaxing, TV, and video games.  They spend 125 hours during a 30-day month watching TV and video games alone. That is more than 50% higher than the 80 hours they would be required to work in a month. Common sense Medicaid work requirements for able-bodied adults take the same approach as welfare reform did in the 1990s. Move people from welfare to work  and self-sufficiency.

All afternoon, CNN was salivating over the prospect that Iran's nuclear capabilities had not been obliterated, as Trump had indicated. Early intel indicating that the strike set back the Iranian nuclear program for months, but perhaps not entirely. The first intel assessment comes from the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's intel wing. And this early look was apparently leaked, as its details are top secret.  Now, it was reportedly based on the evidence presented by CENTCOM. Again, it is their belief that the Iranian nuclear program was sent back, sent back significantly, but not destroyed. Secretary of Defense Hegseth responded to this saying, quote, based on everything we've seen, our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. And White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt shot back, calling the assessment, quote, flat out wrong and a clear attempt to demean President Trump.  Now, knowing President Trump, I think I know him pretty well, he's gonna demand answers here. After all, before he greenlit the bombing, he wanted assurances that the bunker busters could do the trick.

Some Republicans didn't read him right. They thought he was an isolationist. And Democrats didn't read him right. They thought he'd go in half-cocked and start World War III. All of them were wrong. So don't mess with Trump. He'll fight as hard for peace as he does for border enforcement, for tax cuts, and for cutting the bureaucracy.  And he has common sense. And patriotic Americans are on his side. And that's the angle. So how did this ceasefire deal between Iran and Israel actually get negotiated? We know President Trump was directly involved, talking with Bibi Netanyahu, while Vance, Rubio, and my next guest talked with the Iranians.  Donald Trump said he expected the ceasefire to last forever, then both sides violated it. Iran broke the truce first, and then Israel hit back. Trump found out about it right before he left for Holland, and he wasn't even this mad after he got shot.  When I say, okay, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either.

On Air Force One, he dialed Netanyahu and barked at him. Sources say Trump was really angry, told him to knock it off. Unlike Biden, when Trump says don't, people listen, and the ceasefires held since then. Iran's at its weakest point since the 80s, and Israel just cleaned out their whole neighborhood, and they should probably take the win. The question is, does Israel disobey Trump and assassinate the Ayatollah? Does he get couped, or does he remain in power?  Do you want to see regime change in Iran? No. If there was, there was. But no, I don't want it. I'd like to see everything calm down as quickly as possible. Regime change takes chaos. And ideally, we don't want to see so much chaos.

As Buck Sexton said last night, the trend is our friend. President Trump means what he says. Just listen to his words. He's not that hard to figure out.  You can call it the Trump Doctrine if you want, but it is simply a fact. And despite all the smears from the state-run legacy media mob, Trump has always called for global peace. Sometimes that means you got to get tough with both your enemies and your friends. Take a look earlier today.  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land,  I'm not happy about that. You know what? We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing. Do you understand that?  All right, after a tenuous start, the ceasefire is now back on track. Keep in mind, this is a ceasefire less than one week after President Trump obliterated Iran's nuclear program with a massive strike. Take a look at your screen. The strike was a tremendous success, thanks to several bunker-buster bombs that penetrated a mountain and exploded deep underground.  Fordo, their nuclear plant, really no longer exists. We'll get the full assessment in days ahead. Now, there will be a lot of hard work ahead in terms of achieving a lasting peace. That will include checks and balances and measures in place to prevent Iran from ever rebuilding anything nuclear. This should also include Iran's recognition of Israel, and, of course, anywhere, anyplace, anytime inspections, and that would be American inspections.  And of course, a full accounting of all enriched uranium that the Iranians may have moved, that has got to be a part of it as well. My message to Iran, tried to warn you before Donald Trump dropped those bunker busters, if you think you will be clever and you think you'll be able to use your proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah,  Houthi rebels or others to attack Israel, then that war will be back on immediately, and Donald Trump will not come to the rescue and stop Israel this time. He knows that they are acting on orders from you, the Iranian leadership, or whoever's left. From this point forward, Iran's radical leaders, they are committing suicide any and every time they dare attack Israel, either directly or indirectly through their proxies.  But what President Trump has been able to accomplish in the last week is incredible. It is historic. So many presidents talked about it. None of them ever did it. Now, of course, it is driving the Democrats and the media mob, predictably, absolutely crazy. Instead of congratulations, we are seeing condemnation from the left. Insanely, some are even accusing Donald Trump of committing any illegal act.  And even today, 79 Democrats in Congress voted to impeach the president for daring to breach the 1973 War Powers Act, which, as Greg Jarrett points out, quote, it is a notification requirement. And he did notify the leadership on the Democratic side and Republican side in Congress, not a prohibition on the president's right to exert military action. And the president did, in fact, notify those people in Congress he needed to notify, just to be clear.  As Greg Jarrett points out, under Article 2 of the Constitution, the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and that empowers him to direct military operations to deter foreign threats to our national security, without conferring with Jasmine Crockett. Now, this has been well-established over the course of our republic.  No president has ever abided by the War Powers Act, ever. And the act itself even allows presidents a 60-day window to strike at any enemy if they deem necessary. On top of that, after 9-11, Congress  specifically authorized additional powers for a president, granting explicit power to target nations linked to terrorism. That would be Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror. But if Democrats actually disagree with these facts, where then was the outrage? When Joe Biden bombed Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, or when Barack Obama ordered strikes against Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Pakistan, Obama even ordered  a drone strike against a U.S. citizen in Yemen, and yet Democrats then didn't care a whit. In fact, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson all ordered strikes without congressional approval. There's your Hannity history lesson. But Democrats, why let facts get in the way of a great smear campaign against President Trump?  They live, eat, breathe, sleep, hating Trump. If the dog bites, the bee stings, you're feeling sad, blame Trump. If Trump cures cancer, blame him for that, too. They don't like Donald Trump. They don't like that he has emerged as the real, one, true leader of the free world.  Other presidents only made proclamations about Iran and their nuclear program. Donald Trump brought them to their knees. Other presidents politely encouraged NATO members to, you know, take their defense seriously, pay their fair share. Donald Trump got them to start paying their fair share as of today. Other presidents looked the other way.  you know, was piping in oil and gas at lower rates from Russia, you know, funding Putin's war machine, while Donald Trump was calling them out for doing that very thing and then wanting money for defense.

And we've seen some leaks to the media, military assessments that have said the initial assessment shows that it hasn't been obliterated.

And those who have actually pushed back in very conclusive ways also probably should await for the full results. This is a very painstaking process. It's an effort by the overall intelligence community, not just Defense Intelligence Agency. In fact, the CIA would be the  the lead in this effort to mine all sources of intelligence, imagery, intelligence of all types, signals, cyber, even open source intelligence. Now everyone is a journalist who has a smartphone and can record in his or her hand. So again, this is going to take a while. The truth is that there has been undoubtedly enormous damage done to the Iranian nuclear program. I would suspect it's been set back years at the least, but  Let's wait and see. One of the big questions that is out there and has been out there even before the bombing is whether or not all of the highly enriched uranium and all of the centrifuges were present at these locations that had been bombed. Of course, then there's a question about how badly damaged were they, especially inside the deeply buried site  under Fordow Mountain, where 12 of these enormous mountain busters, bunker buster doesn't do them credit, 30,000-pound massive ordnance penetrators that carry 5,000 pounds of explosive when they're penetrated as far as they can. But again, no one has been inside there that I'm aware of. In fact, I believe there's sand covering the tunnels put there by the Iranians in the days leading up to this.

So that was a much, much bigger operation than we saw the other day, which in and of itself had 125 aircraft taking part.  Since then, particularly in recent years, there have been rumors about another deeply buried site, never confirmed or denied. And certainly there should be concerns about whether or not some of the HEU and some of the centrifuges were squirreled away somewhere else.  prior to the bombing carried out by the Israelis and the Americans.

And now that Syria is no longer an ally, it'll be much more difficult for Iran to reconstitute Hezbollah, since they can't drive across Syria to do that, if they have anything to spare for Syria, noting that they have to rebuild their own missile launchers, stocks, air and ballistic missile defenses, and all the rest of that. I do think it was the right time to do this. And I think we really need to understand, I'm sure you have felt it there on the ground,  how profound a change 10-7 brought about in the strategic calculus of Israel and its leaders of all parties. And that is that they will never again stand by and watch as a country in their neighborhood or even in their region  builds the kind of threats that Hezbollah and Hamas and Iraq posed to Israel prior to 10-7. And of course, this is the final really big element of that overall effort, given the damage done to Hamas, the real destruction of Hezbollah in so many respects."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 394.94, "text": " are you worried that this could turn into some kind of war of attrition and that we have a president in the White House that frankly has a short attention span and as far as he is concerned this was one and done the United States did what it needed to do he's now called for a ceasefire  and perhaps he'll move on.

But then also, will there be some kind of agreement between the countries or between the U.S. and Iran? There's such leverage right now on the side of the Israelis, especially if supported by the Americans, that you could insist that they give up all the elements of their nuclear program and allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to validate that, to verify that, to have the right to inspect anywhere they want at any time.  And then, of course, will the two countries continue to refrain from hitting each other? I think that's probably like that. I mean, this is a really novel approach by the president, who essentially declared, certainly without consulting the Iranians, perhaps with consulting to the Israelis,  stop shooting at each other. And they violated that, of course, and they scolded them very firmly. And it appears that they have actually done that. We'll see if that actually holds, and then see if there can be some kind of agreement between the warring parties in this case, most significantly, again, about Iran's nuclear program.

The zero side isn't just beaten, they're usually embarrassed.

It might mean, we got nothing. Or it might mean,  You got nothing, meaning the feds. You got nothing. A lot of court watchers thought that Diddy himself might actually take the stand, believing that he could outperform the government's 34 witnesses and then some. But that did not happen. This did. Wow! You see it like that, you really do feel it, right? You feel all seven weeks of trial. 34 witnesses in seven weeks.  Instead, we got the next best thing in this sex trafficking racketeering trial. We got Diddy doing his damnedest to turn the pants off the judge in this courtroom today. A judge who spoke to Diddy first, asking him,  How you feeling? And Puff Daddy, you know, being Puff Daddy, answered, quote, I'm doing great, your honor. I've been wanting to tell you, thank you. You're doing an excellent job, end quote. To which the judge replied, thank you, I appreciate it. I don't often hear a defendant stand up and say that, but I don't often see a defendant like Diddy.  For their part, his legal team moved immediately to throw the whole case out, claiming that the prosecutors over there did not come close to meeting their burden of proof for this trial. News slash, that is almost standard operating procedure after prosecutors rest their case. And if your lawyer doesn't throw that hail Mary, time to get a new lawyer.  For his part, the judge did not rule on Diddy's lawyer's request to toss it all out. But you just wait for it. It's coming. Yeah. Lawyers actually have to come back to the court tomorrow without the rest of us all there so that they can hammer out all the jury instructions. So yeah, you're probably going to get that ruling tomorrow. And I'm going to bet my house, judge says, fat chance. Those are my words, but that's effectively what I think is going to happen. And speaking of the government's case,  The feds rested with yet another mountain of receipts today, as well as text messages and video clips of and about the events they call freak-offs. But the witnesses have called hotel nights or sometimes king nights or even wild king nights.  And over the weekend, they released pages and pages of internal messages. I mean, this stuff was gold, Jerry. Diddy's staff members, like, furiously texting each other, ah, what they needed to get to make things absolutely perfect for their boss, no matter how gross the requests.  In one message, an assistant named Joey Chavez writes, and I quote, need more BO, that's baby oil, and AG, that's AstroGlide, tomorrow, before everybody leaves. And then another staffer named Frank Butler on the chat responds, just packed 30 bottles of baby oil. Joey, exactly how much do we need? And Joey's answer, as much as possible.  I can't even imagine being on this text, Jane. And then that same Joey later on asks, what's our BO slash AG count? That's, you know, baby oil and astraglide count. And then Frank replies, 30 plus on each. Then comes this message about Diddy's girlfriend, again, from the name Frank Butler. Quote, we need to put Jane on payroll if she ain't already.  And you know that Jane is, of course, that alleged victim, right? Ex-girlfriend of Diddy's, who testified at length under a pseudonym. Her real name in the original text, we redacted it out, right? It just says Jane. And some texts are super-duper explicit. A Diddy assistant writes, okay, I need to refresh her bag of blanks.  Oh my God, it's actually up there on the screen. Okay, so I can't say that, but I need to refresh her bag of blanks and send to her. The her in that message also appears to be Jane, and Frank Butler adds, need the sex luggages and light, which I think means lights because they talked a lot about having tons and tons of red lights in the hotel rooms for these freaky, freak off, king knights, wild king knights, whatever you call them. And then this one.  I say this a lot, but I really mean it this time. Get a whiskey for this one. Or make sure you just don't do a spit take. Because this next one involves the excessive lube and baby oil that must have been going down in those hotel rooms. Because this is a message post-freak-off.  KK, who you'll know by now is Diddy's ex-chief of staff, Christina Coram, texts this question. How's the cleanup going? To which Joey, the poor, long-suffering assistant, responds, slipped and fell twice. I don't know if that's a joke or serious, because honestly, with 1,000 bottles of lube and baby oil, it could have been serious, could have been real.  Later on, KK sends out a week-long operations plan to the team. Jane is scheduled for multiple, quote, wild king nights, while the team is instructed to be fully staffed and standing by, both for Diddy's meet-up with Jane.  but then also for the meet-up with the next girlfriend, the rapper Young Miami. She's arriving immediately afterwards. Or maybe there's crossover. I don't know. It's Diddy. I'm going to arrest my case right now. I'm going to bring in my guest, Maria Cruz Melendez. She's a former federal prosecutor who handled multiple organized crime cases, in particular the R. Kelly conviction, which, may I remind you, was sex trafficking and racketeering in the Southern District.  And Sarah Azari is a criminal defense attorney and News Nation legal analyst and also one of our favorites. Ladies, so good to have you both. I cannot wait for this conversation. Maria, Diddy's team bailed. They decided they were not going to mount a case. They were not going to... Well, they put a few things on the record, but they weren't going to call a single witness. Do you believe, with all of your background and experience,  that they really did think the government didn't meet its burden? Or do you believe that they couldn't find an unimpeachable witness to get up there and sing Diddy's praises without risk of the prosecution tearing them to ribbons?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 418.463, "text": " Yeah, I think at the end of the day, they're weighing whether or not they can make the arguments that they want to make on closing without giving access to the prosecution to witnesses where they could make additional points. And so is it possible that they had a number of witnesses that could have provided helpful information? I think that's absolutely the case.  But to use your word, would they have been unimpeachable? Probably not. I think they would have given access to the prosecution to make additional points. And you mentioned earlier the fact that the defense doesn't have a burden. They don't need to put a case on. And so I think at the end of the day, what they're going to end up relying on is the fact that they think the government hasn't met each and every one of the elements that they're supposed to meet."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 465.275, "text": " So, Sarah, I know from watching so much of your coverage, you have not felt at any point in this trial, to my knowledge, that the prosecution has mounted a racketeering and sex trafficking case.

And I think that they're definitely overreaching on the racketeering. It's just putting Jane on, having two victims going missing. Remember that this jury, when they go to deliberate, they're not going to just be focused on what evidence was presented, but what evidence is missing.  Where did those two other victims go? Where is Christina Coram, who's been referenced in text messages and is clearly a co-conspirator? So I don't think they have him on that. I do think that they've met their burden, beyond a reasonable doubt, on the prostitution. We've got male escorts being flown around for the purposes of sex across state lines, and I think that that's a clear thing.  If I was the defense, Ashley, I wouldn't be mad at that charge, right? Because that helps the jury get this really bad guy on something and don't let him walk out unscathed. So I kind of like the prostitution charge in the mix as a defense attorney. When I've got these kinds of facts, I don't think they've met their burden on the sex trafficking either.  You know, we've got two different kinds of victims. We have a Jane victim, and then we have a Cassie victim. And they're different dynamics. They're different relationships. One's vulnerable. One's actually, to me, an equal, Jane is. And I just \u2014 I think this is going to be a hard, daunting task for this jury to think, were these women not just adults who were consenting to this freaky lifestyle, or was this really coercion?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 578.337, "text": " So I'm glad you brought that up because, Maria, I would love you to weigh in on this. All the way along, I have felt like Cassie was beaten into submission from the evidence that I saw. She just tried to go to a party once and she was yanked out by her hair and beaten black and blue just for going to a party. God forbid she leave the man. So I feel as though the terror was real for Cassie, that she had to perform lest she deal with that, you know, on a regular basis. And when I say regular,  Many of the witnesses could not count how many times they saw her beaten and black and blue. But Jane was different. She had a $10,000 a month apartment that she didn't want to lose. Does that matter to these jurors? Or could they just say, I see sex trafficking with Cassie, I don't see it with Jane, but that is still a predicate act for racketeering?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 629.519, "text": " Well, I think at the end of the day, I agree with Sarah in that the Mann Act, the prostitution charges, are likely to see a conviction with those. But Jane is different in terms of the relationship, and I think that's where the defense has poked the most holes in the government's case and their cross-examination of Jane. And so I do think there's a stark comparison between the two of them.  And so the jury can decide at the end of the day. Count two is the sex trafficking with regard to Cassie Ventura. So they're going to find guilty\u2014find him guilty on that. I think it's likely they'll find guilty, as we mentioned, on the Mann Act stuff. The RICO is sort of a toss-up, because I do think it hinges on their ability to show that there was a co-conspirator. And I think the defense counsel has an opportunity to say here,  We didn't see Christina Coram. This is the co-conspirator. We didn't see Christina Coram testify here, and there's not enough evidence to show this. So I think we could see a split verdict. We could very much so see a situation where they look at Jane and they say, you were a consenting adult. There are lots of text messages that suggest  that you either enjoyed it or perhaps maybe it wasn't your cup of tea, but you did it because you were his girlfriend and you did it because you wanted to please him and because you loved him, not because you were scared of the consequences of not doing it."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 713.219, "text": " There is that financial fear, though, that he was dangling over her head in several messages saying, I can take that apartment away at any time.

I don't know how much money she was making as an OnlyFans model, but she had a three-month security deposit on that $10,000. Let me tell you, I'm from L.A. That's a lot of rent in L.A.  Okay, and that's, you know, she wanted providers. She liked men to pay for her. That's a choice, right? And as much as Diddy was holding up the rent card, I'm gonna pull the rent if you don't do this and that, don't get on your job, you know, in one of the text messages, she was pulling the hotel night card, essentially saying, if you don't get back here from that vacation you're taking with this other woman that I'm jealous of, you're not gonna get a hotel night.  So there was very much, I did not see a power dynamic at play in this relationship. I very much saw her as somebody who stands her ground as a first aggressor in an altercation that they had. She's the one that attacks them first. So she's not the same person to me. There's really a split screen between her and Cassie. With Cassie, we have a control. She was younger, she was vulnerable. We have control of her career. We have control of her, like you said,  who she hangs out with, what she does. There was a lot more control there. And honestly, look, to Maria's point, they could find him not guilty as to sex trafficking Jane, but guilty as to Cassie. I mean, he's still doomed.

My brothers and sisters, I believe it is time. Time. Okay? I know the fake fighting works. It works for the parties. It works for the pod bros. It works for the media. We love the ratings of when they're going at it with each other. It's great. But we have to see  that there is a real enemy that matters so much more than every other contrivance. It hates both sides. It is coming for all of us, for real. So whatever you think threatens you, trans athletes,  ICE tactics, socialists, Trump talk, fake news, none of it compares to what actually is hunting all of us. I realized it was time for a wake-up call when AOC, a member of Congress from New York, was hapless enough to call for impeaching Trump again, this time for doing something that led to a ceasefire.  On Saturday, AOC tweeted, the president's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and congressional war powers. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment. Now, I categorically disagree, and I don't think you'll find a legal expert that gives her anything but kind of an eye roll. And  But she got what she wanted, attention and Trump to hit back, right? Stupid AOC is now calling for my impeachment, despite the fact that Democrats tried that twice before. Go ahead and try impeaching me again. Make my day. AOC strikes back at Trump, writing, Mr. President, don't take your anger out on me. I'm just a silly girl. Take it out on whomever convinced you to betray the American people. AOC is right.  This is silly. And so is she. And so is the President's response. But this is where we are because this is how they want it. And it has spawned a problem neither can contain. There is a reason AOC's main allies on impeachment are the Podbros, okay? While I think there is a legal argument,  that a president should need Congress for military action like what Trump just did unilaterally? There is no will in Congress to check the president. They will not impeach, and they will never remove. So, why would you do it? I've asked this with each impeachment of Trump, and the answer was always the same. Principle. But here's what I've realized, and I think you probably have, too. That principle is empty outrage.  Okay, and that is AOC's signature cause. That is why for six years, AOC has accomplished nothing but a social media following in Congress. Find a major law she passed as the lead sponsor. The best you'll find is an attempt at the Green New Deal, which was a disaster for Democrats. She hasn't done anything effective about healthcare prices that are going up. People are getting 20, 30% increases in their premium. Where is she on that?  Rent prices going up. She just wants it free, right? Just makes people angry, just plays to outrage. I don't know what's worse, being so impractical or so incendiary. But the time for posing and manufacturing fear is over. If you think you're going to out-MAGA MAGA, you're wrong. And it doesn't matter, because the fake fights  are now exposed. We have an actual terror coming. In fact, it's here. It is among us, and it is part of us.  ICE just arrested 11 Iranian nationals in the past 48 hours, including a man with ties to the IRGC and Hezbollah. The FBI is shifting agents it assigned to immigration enforcement to counter terror. We learned after Trump's Saturday night address about the bombings that the regime told him that they may mobilize sleeper cells if he bombed. Would have been good to know that in advance.  We also had to wait to hear that cyberattacks from the regime blocked the president's own messages on social media about the bombing. We ignore cyber. For some reason, if one person gets hurt physically, we go crazy. But they can hurt tens of thousands with a cyberattack, and it's like, we don't care. I don't get it. We got to wake up. That's what this is about.  Just because the regime can't retaliate in an overt military way doesn't mean it can't keep doing what it's done for decades. And unlike after 9-11, our worry is not just about brown guys with beards screaming about Allah. Extremism has taken root among our own people, many of whom are brown with beards, by the way. It's not about how you look. It's about how you think, okay?  especially among our young people. We see them on both fringes. The number one terror threat domestically for years has been what? You're probably thinking, Muslims? Wrong. Right-wing, white nationalism. Now it has an equal opposite on the left, with this perverse affinity for fundamentalists like Hamas. Globalize the intifada. We hear alleged Democrats questioning Israel's right to exist, saying the regime in Iran is a victim?  Both sides going all in on what? Destroying the democracy. Every institution is bad. There is no truth. There is no law and order. There is no justice. There is only fealty to one side. And yes, I blame the parties. And yes, I blame the political players who have made disruption and destroying the institution's commonplace in politics. It has encouraged people to use violence to advance political agendas. And you don't have to believe me. You just have to research.  Look at all the recent political violence. There are no jihadis from the Middle East, just Americans and an Egyptian national who bought into all the extremism in the atmosphere. The guy in Boulder was an Egyptian national. But your boy Mangione, assassinating a healthcare CEO in New York,  Right? The guy who blew himself up outside the IVF clinic in California, the guy who assassinated two Israeli embassy staffers, the guy who shot the lawmakers in Minnesota and their spouses. These are not jihadis. These are homegrown extremists. This is the enemy, a modern-day cerebus, a two-headed hound of hell, and it is coming for us online and in person. For Democrats,  You need to seize this opportunity. This is why immigration resonated with the many, not just MAGA. The majority is not afraid of migrants, as Trump may like, but they are afraid of these guys, Iranian nationals with jihadist sympathies. You let them in with a laxity that AOC and other radicals insisted on. And the far left is actively embracing people who are the enemy.  Pro-Hamas? People who chant, globalize the Intifada? The Palestinian uprising characterized by over 130 suicide bombings? Really? And I'm not picking on AOC. I respect her success in developing a following. I just think that she's killing her party. She is a deranged form of Democrat.  And I'm pointing her out because she's at the top of the food chain. A recent CNN poll found she's the top Democratic leader who best reflects the core values of the Democratic Party, and this is by Democratic voters. She ranked higher than Harris, Jeffries, Newsom, even Obama. Are you kidding me? She couldn't be less about what made the Democratic Party great, and I get to say that.  She is not a real one. I was raised by a real one. Google Mario Cuomo. Google Teddy Kennedy. Google Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Google any of the legends. You know the names. Remember the ideas.  Mario Cuomo was a child of immigrants. He was considered less than himself. He would have never allowed a porous border or fake fights and socialistic calls for free everything, especially when there was a real bill to battle for Medicaid and tax breaks for the working class.  AOC is popular because extremism drives social media and magnifies minorities. Pissing people off pays off. But radicals keep missing the rational majority. AOC and the radical left are the party of 20% when the country is the other 80%. Only 4% say Iran getting a nuke is not important.  Only 18% say that men who identify as women shouldn't play in women's or girls' sports. Only 1 in 3 voters say foreign students who support terrorists should stay here. Only 16% of Americans want deportations to stop. Only 27% of voters support abolishing ICE and forget about defunding the police or free everything.  Everything that she represents is a fringe fascination. And that is what that party has become. And this is a wake-up call. You will not get back to where you want to be by abandoning everything that the majority finds reasonable. And I got to tell you, that's why her allies on impeachment are the MAGA pod bros. I mean, what are they pretending?  that they're coming for Trump over the Iranian regime? Calling to impeach the only guy who ever made them relevant? Why would they be in a hurry to get rid of Trump when they will be gone as soon as he is? Here's why. Because both fringes are extreme and part of the problem. Where are the better ideas to help?

And his life is on the line, right? You open up all your cards in the state case, and the feds get to use it, and the consequences are really big with the feds.  It is not entirely settled as to which case is going to end up going first, but the state prosecutors definitely think that their case should go first.

What the prosecution in that federal case is going to do is  pick apart every single thing that they can to show either that he's lying, to show that he's not being truthful. And in a state prosecution, in any prosecution in a case like this, there are so many pieces of evidence that may come in, may not come in, and elements that need to be proven by the prosecution that don't necessarily relate to each different  crime, right? So in federal court, the elements of what he's being charged with may be completely different than the elements in state court. Sure, there's an overlapping murder, but the things that need to be proven individually differ. And what that means is that the defense in a state case could be significantly different than the defense in the federal case. And when that happens, you better believe that a federal prosecutor is going to say, wait a minute, that's not  what he argued in the state case. He's lying, or they're changing their story.

Late last month, May 29th, Angie went missing and then 10 days later, agents from NCIS found Angie's body 10 miles from her barracks. But this is how Naval Seaman Angelina Resendez was returned to her heartbroken family in Texas in a flag-draped coffin, an American flag.  That woman that you see there in the white dress is quite obviously Angie's mom, who we met on this program just a few days before this tragic homecoming. As we reported then, the Navy does have a suspect, a fellow active-duty sailor assigned to Angie's ship.  But this is where things get really quiet, because crime and punishment within the military seems to be on a strictly need-to-know basis, and the Navy seems to look at us, us civilians, as though we don't need to know too much. So I turn now to retired Coast Guard commander Marshall Griffin. He's a former JAG officer, which is what they call attorneys and judges in the armed forces. Marshall is now representing the mother  of Seaman Angela Resendiz. Thank you so much for being on. I have so many questions for you. We have not named the suspect, Marshall.

All planes will turn around and head home while doing a friendly plane wave to Iran. Nobody will be hurt. The ceasefire is in effect. Speaking to reporters later, he detailed his direct and firm message to Netanyahu. And this is a quote from Trump. You have to call back the planes. It's enough.  So let's look at this internationally. The way that Trump talked to Netanyahu told the Arabs that Trump is willing to stand up to Israel. Domestically, this told Americans that Trump is not an Israeli puppet. So say what you want about Donald Trump. But he showed leadership, and more importantly, the other side listened. Reuters aptly pointed out Benjamin Netanyahu has strong-armed American presidents for decades. For over three decades, Netanyahu has clashed, often spectacularly, with American leaders.  Netanyahu has lectured them, defied them, embarrassed them publicly and privately. No matter how fraught his relationship with successive presidents, he normally ends up getting what he wants. Bill Clinton, for example, left a meeting with Netanyahu furious and reportedly berated his staff, asking, who's the blanking superpower, a word President Trump used in a different way today.  Obama scolded Netanyahu in a meeting by basically saying, I'm the president, I know what I'm talking about. Did not go well for Obama. Joe Biden called Netanyahu a bad, blanking guy. Again, Trump used the word differently today. And none of them were able to get Netanyahu to fall in line. And also, they were all too scared to say it publicly. Trump just ended that trend once and for all with three words to Netanyahu, stop the attack.  America is better off because of Trump's willingness to stand up to the Israeli leader. And equally important, the Middle East is on a far more firm path to lasting peace with America now in the driver's seat. And to cap it off, Trump is in Europe with newfound street cred. He ended Iran's nuclear program and stopped the Israelis from starting an endless war with Iran."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 208.252, "text": " Thank you for watching.

Markets hate uncertainty, and we're moving from uncertainty to, I think, things that are more certain. So what are those things? Tariff, the impact the tariffs are going to have on growth and inflation. So we believe,  Maybe inflation goes up by 30 basis points. That clip you mentioned with Jerome Powell, say if we have a sustained move in inflation higher, then we're going to be in a tough spot. But they didn't say that last week. Last week they said we're going to see a little bump up in inflation, it's going to be temporary, and then it's going to come back down. And if growth slips, we're going to be there with two rate cuts this year. They said that last week. The second piece of uncertainty for us was geopolitics. This is what you're referring to over the last 48 hours.  And it's not just geopolitics, Liz, but it's the effect that geopolitics have on oil, which you just pointed out.

It's Wednesday, the 25th of June in London. I'm Caroline Hepke. And I'm Stephen Carroll. Coming up today, an early US intelligence report shows American airstrikes have only had a limited impact on Iran's nuclear program. The EU warns it will impose tariffs on American imports if the White House keeps a baseline levy on its goods.  Plus, struggling to work it out, ChatGPT's appeal to office workers presents a growing problem for its biggest backer, Microsoft. Let's start with a roundup of our top stories.  America's unprecedented airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities had only a limited impact, according to early U.S. intelligence findings. A report by the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency says the bombing likely didn't cripple the core components of Iran's program, including its centrifuges. According to people familiar with the assessments, the U.S. strikes are likely to have set Tehran's plans back by several months to as much as a year.  U.S. President Donald Trump's team dismissed the reports, which cast doubt on his claim that the strikes totally obliterated their targets. White House Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt posted on X that the intelligence finding of limited impact was flat-out wrong and, quote, a clear attempt to demean President Trump.  Despite the White House's pushback comments, the assessment will likely only intensify calls from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog for renewed inspections of the targeted sites. This as a ceasefire Trump brokered to end the 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran appears to be holding after 24 hours.  Meanwhile, President Trump has cast doubt on NATO's founding principle as he arrived at the military alliance's annual summit here in Europe. Trump was asked by reporters on Air Force One if he was still committed to Article 5 of NATO, which says that allies will come to the aid of a country under armed attack."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 138.296, "text": "It depends on your definition.

And NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte texted the US President to say, quote, Europe is going to pay in a big way, as they should, and it will be your wish.  The European Union has planned retaliatory tariffs if the White House keeps its baseline levies on EU goods. Bloomberg has learned that the European Commission is preparing a list of American imports worth 95 billion euros to tax on top of its existing duties. Officials told Bloomberg they expect certain US tariffs will remain in place even if trade talks go well and the EU will respond to those.  The US has just two weeks left before President Trump's self-imposed pause on tariffs elapses, with only the UK securing any deal on paper so far.  Chinese companies are ramping up shipments to Britain in a sign of how US tariffs are reshaping global trade.

Although the shift could put downward pressure on prices, it also has the UK government on watch for unfair competition. In London, James Walcock, Bloomberg Radio.

According to preliminary results, Mamdani garnered 43.5% of the vote and Cuomo just over 36%. Here's Bloomberg's Denise Pellegrini.

And those are our top stories for you this morning. Right. In the markets, this ceasefire between Israel and Iran seems to be holding. Oil prices are up by 1.2% for Brent crude futures this morning, but we're still trading on the 67 handle, 67.98. So there is relief there. Also, we saw the Nasdaq rising 1.5% on Tuesday, notching up another record high versus February. So we've seen a huge rebound for the Nasdaq, something like 30%.  The S&P 500 also climbed 1.1% yesterday. Stock futures this morning are positive, up 0.2% for the Euro stocks, 50 futures this morning. It's interesting, though, the markets took Powell's testimony the first day of it yesterday as dovish, which  I thought was a little bit strange given that he reiterated this idea of no rush to cut interest rates. But markets did boost bets on a reduction. They're looking at July, it would seem. So, let's see if that changes again today. The other thing to think about too, so European stocks yesterday really rallied 1.1% at the close of the U.S. stocks, 600 lifted by airline stocks. And then just looking at the bond markets, 10-year U.S. yields of 4.3%.  in a moment more on that U.S. intelligence report on the effect of U.S. strikes on Iran, plus the rivalry, the curious rivalry between two artificial intelligence names for the battle for the office, the workplace who's using A.I. at work. A word first, though, on another story that's caught our eye. This morning, dating apps are out, matchmakers are in. I really like this story, it's hilarious. At what point could we have told this story over the past 20 years?  Well, yes, but I think it's the cost of the matchmakers that has surprised me. And also, so this is Bloomberg's Ignacio Gonzalez and Lara Sally have been writing about dating. I did not know that Match Group, which owns Tinder, has been seeing the number of paying clients online decline for eight consecutive quarters. So actually, yes, the apps  are grim, they are becoming less popular. Apparently, match groups, a business isn't expected to return to revenue growth until 2027. But the organizations that are making money and apparently growing are these matchmaking services that cost thousands, if not tens of thousands of pounds slash dollars slash euros.  It just feels like one of those moments where you have sort of a cyclical turn in an industry where all of a sudden dating apps were huge for a certain amount of time and maybe this is the move on to the next phase, people are going back to in-person connections. But a very interesting read from our colleagues talking through, speaking to some of those matchmakers and some of the people that use them and what they expect out of it and whether or not they think it's good value for money. Yeah, well it is if you find it.  Well, that's the point. But then if you don't, are you going to be annoyed that you spent thousands of dollars on a service that didn't yield results? And I suppose what's the science behind it? A really interesting story. We'll put a link to it in our show notes and you'll find it of course on Bloomberg.com and on the Terminal.  Now, there is a ceasefire holding between Israel and Iran, but Bloomberg has learned that U.S. intelligence assessments show only limited impact from U.S. airstrikes on Tehran's nuclear program. This is despite President Trump saying at the weekend that the strikes totally obliterated their targets. Joining us now is Bloomberg's EMEA News Director Roslyn Matheson. Good morning, Ros. What do we actually know about the damage done to Iran's nuclear program? We have  this assessment from the Pentagon and also the IAEA, they clash with President Trump's view. Well that's right, it's actually interesting to see the White House actually criticizing its own intelligence findings because as you say the Defense Intelligence Agency at the Pentagon has found at least an initial assessment is that it's unlikely that the U.S. bombing crippled the core parts of Iran's  nuclear facilities below the ground of course they're deep underground including their centrifuges and on the back of that you've got the IAEA of course the UN energy monitors who've been saying for days it's very unclear what's going on but they doubt that these strikes set back Iran's atomic ambitions significantly you know could it be months could it be years  And of course the question above all is where is this uranium that's enriched already to a 60% level that the IAEA has lost track of. So those bits of evidence in the satellite images that we've got suggest that it's unlikely that significant damage was caused to these  to these sites, of course, the view from the White House is that they've been totally obliterated. And that's the line they're sticking to and in line with the Israelis who have said that a key part of their goal in their own strikes against Israel was to destroy these facilities. And so the question really is, as the dust clears, metaphorically and literally, do we get a better sense  of those facilities, but without enough IAEA monitors on the ground, and there are limited numbers there, it's very hard to verify exactly what's going on.  Ros, this is of course as we're watching for further developments out of the Middle East as well. We've had some comments from the Iranian President Massoud Pazashkian as well talking about the great wounds that were inflicted by the strikes from Israel as well and claiming that Israel's failed to achieve its goals in Iran. The ceasefire 24 hours on does appear to be holding?  It does appear to be holding, although it's very fragile. I mean, even as we saw yesterday, some extraordinary 24 to 48 hours, and we had at least a little bit of concern that the ceasefire, which we weren't quite sure when it was going to take effect, having an early wobble with a strike from Iran and then Israel feeling the need to respond to that. So it's incredibly fragile. I mean, these are two countries who've been  firing missiles and drones at each other only days ago and getting the two countries to stand down is very difficult given their history, given of course the weakening that Israel has done against Iran through its proxies Hezbollah in Lebanon, its continuing war in Gaza against Hamas. There's a lot of complexity there. So it's very difficult to get a ceasefire  and make it stick. And beyond that, it's really hard to get a path towards some kind of more stable diplomacy. Of course, we've seen many rounds of talks to try and get some kind of deal over Iran's nuclear program. Those talks have gone nowhere. Maybe now they've got a small window. I mean, Iran has obviously seen that Israel and the US mean business, so that might prompt something. But how or when diplomacy can get a chance here, that is also very unclear.  Mm. Meanwhile, NATO, the NATO gathering, the Secretary General Mark Russia has dialled up the flattery of President Trump to kind of warp speed. The President, though, on board Air Force One, you heard him there kind of crackly talking about collective defence. It depends on your definition. This will surely alarm Europeans.  Well, it certainly will, because they spent months and months preparing the ground for this meeting, this summit of NATO leaders, and the idea being to basically avoid Donald Trump saying or doing anything that might cast further doubt on NATO. So careful preparations to get people to agree to this 5% defence spending.  amount. Of course, Spain not yet there, which is awkward for Rote and NATO as a whole. Other countries dragging the chain also, arguably, on that and trying to avoid Trump again putting the question mark over Article 5, which is this framework really under which NATO operates. The idea that you defend each other when needed. I mean, Article 5 is pretty clear on that, but Donald Trump already on the plane over, musing aloud about what  it might mean. And that's really what we've been expecting. The idea that for Europe, at least, this has all been a significant wake-up call. For Europe, when you're thinking about the future, you've got to presume that the US may not be there, even despite the Article 5  existing or coming to aid in a different way than you'd expect, different kinds of assistance. And that's certainly the parameters that Donald Trump now seems to be laying out. So whether he commits to something at the end of this remains to be seen. We'll see in a press conference later today, but certainly it's off to a bit of a wobbly start. Okay. RMEA News Director, Rosalind Matheson. Thank you.  Now, as more people start using artificial intelligence tools at work, competition is heating up for enterprise contracts. So Microsoft, the dominant supplier of workplace software, seeing its AI assistant co-pilot lose out to OpenAI's chat GPT. The behind-the-scenes dogfight is complicating an already fraught relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI. Our reporter Tiwa Adebayo is here with more on this. Tiwa, good morning.  How big do you think the rivalry between Microsoft and OpenAI is?  The answer is, it's pretty big. It's certainly very lucrative and it's actually still growing. It's something of an unlikely situation, actually, given that Microsoft has invested nearly $14 billion in OpenAI since 2019. So, you'd think they might be all in on the firm. But actually, also in that time, Microsoft has backed other rival AI startups. They've built their own models and they've stalled OpenAI's restructuring plan. So, the relationship is slightly fraught.  On the other side of that equation, you have OpenAI. They've signed deals with rival cloud computing partners, so Microsoft rivals. And for example, they've recently agreed to acquire AI coding assistant Windsurf, which directly competes with Microsoft's GitHub copilot.  So, the two seem to be the frenemies in the tech world at best. But they're also, of course, competing for market share in the corporate world. OpenAI says it has 3 million paying business users, whilst a Microsoft spokesperson said CoPilot  is being used by 70% of the Fortune 500. And their paid users have tripled compared with this time last year. So it does seem that Microsoft is slightly edging ahead in that corporate race for now. But as our reporting shows, that could all be about to change. So what are they competing on, I suppose? What are the selling points for each of these companies with their products?  Well, that's the thing, Stephen, they're quite similar. So, both companies are essentially pitching AI assistants that can help with the sort of labour-intensive administrative tasks in the workplace, so writing, research, analysing data, and they're saying that they can free up workers to focus on more meaningful challenges. And it gets worse because both chatbots are largely based on the same open AI model, so very similar offering on both sides. Microsoft  spokesperson is quoted in our really detailed story about this on the terminal and they say that what sets them apart is Fine-tuning the technology for business use so after all Microsoft has been in the corporate space for much Longer programs like Outlook and Excel for example their workplace staples So they know what's going on and whilst chat GPT dominates the consumer space Microsoft says they're in tune with business needs and that's why they have Barclays and Accenture for example as clients  But our reporting is showing that many office workers are convinced that ChatGPT is the better product after using it in their personal lives. And so now they're actually convincing their bosses to make the switch over to OpenAI.  So, in terms of the broader effects then on the use of AI on the workplace, I mean, I must admit I've been messing about with AI, but it is much more, you know, at home for things outside of work. It's obviously going to be coming to workplaces in a big way.  Yeah, I mean, there's been a number of reports saying that there are benefits of using AI in the workplace in terms of productive capacity and also really speeding up those menial tasks. For example, this week, there's new research from MIT that says AI agents can raise worker productivity by 60 percent. So AI agents being complex sort of artificial intelligence models  that can work autonomously and can actually be fine-tuned to employee personality types as well. So, some pretty high-level things going on. Some are really just banking on this technology for a breakthrough. We heard from Andrew Bailey recently, Governor of the Bank of England, who suggested that AI could be used to sort of counter the collapse in the U.K. 's long-term growth rate by really boosting productivity.  But having said that, there are concerns about the potential for AI use at work to lead to job cuts, especially when it comes to junior roles. Those are the ones that usually comprise of more of the administrative tasks, and they're largely taken up by graduates who are already facing a difficult job market. So some concerns there. It's not all positive news when it comes to AI in the workplace, but it's certainly making an impact so far.

God bless them and God bless our troops who are keeping us safe. Now, over the weekend, President Trump delivered peace through strength.  Operation Midnight Hammer was not only a historic and successful mission, it was a message to Iran, a message that resonates for years, if not decades to come. Iran will never be allowed to attain a nuclear weapon. And if Iran continues to try to go down this path,  prepare to face the full fury and wrath of American firepower. Because of President Trump's decisive action, the world is a safer place. And let me be clear, America is safer, Israel is safer,  and our allies are safer. And like President Vance said, we are not at war with Iran. We are at war with Iran's nuclear program. The war against their nuclear program is already paying off. And thank you to President Trump for his decisive action again. Peace through strength is working.  Now, switching gears, let me say this. The American people are waiting. They want to know with certainty that their taxes won't increase $5,000 next year. They want to know that violent, illegal immigrants are not in their communities anymore. But they don't have it yet. Because, unfortunately, they're still waiting for the one big, beautiful act.  And each day that goes by is another day that Americans don't have the certainty that they deserve. Whether you're a small business owner, a senior on Social Security, a tipped service worker, or a first responder working overtime to protect our communities, the one big beautiful bill helps you. Americans should not have to wait any longer.  There's no time to waste. Let's get this done. Let's send this bill to President Trump's desk so it can become law.

The official line in parts of government, parts of government this morning at around six o'clock when I was scratching everywhere, is that there is a strong expectation  a strong expectation that the vote will go ahead on Tuesday. Now, I sort of, and I'm not a good person, Anne, I slightly baited somebody and said, how strong is a strong expectation? Is that a utter, a total promise that their credibility might depend on that the vote will definitely go ahead, this second reading vote, i.e. the vote on the principles of the bill. This is a bill that is designed to  reduce the entitlements for some disabled people to cut the personal independent payments from certain categories of disabled people. And I just got the line, it's a strong expectation. So, the Times says this morning that some around Keir Starmer are thinking of pulling the bill, even though the Chancellor has stepped in to try and reduce the rebellion.  But given that the rebellion started at 108, that was 108 names tweeted or put on X by the former Transport Secretary Lou Haig, and by the end of the day that had gone up to 127, with I think only one or two names actually being removed from the bell, it is all going in the wrong direction. And just a reminder for you, Anne, the government's working majority, according to the Parliament website today, is 165. So it takes 83 Labour MPs  out of the 127 declared to vote with a united opposition and this bill is dead and if that happens along with it will go a lot of this government political and moral credibility as well as its relationship with the parliamentary party which will be deeply severed if that happens."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 181.133, "text": " And the Tories last night played their hand in a pretty smart move by Kemi Beydinoglu that makes Keir Starmer's life even harder.

So it's really baiting a trap for Labour there, Sam, on two fronts, setting  conditions. And the government can cry foul about this and say it's inconsistent or whatever they want to say, but the spotlight is going to be on Starmer's numbers problem in the Commons Chamber on Tuesday.

It's the part about alcohol. And so, lots in Westminster will be very interested to hear that. Apparently, it's a big problem.

Stalmer might be relieved in the circumstances to be spending his second day at the NATO summit in The Hague. The announcement there is that the UK will be buying at least 12 F-35A  stealth jets, so the ones that can carry nuclear warheads. And it's the most significant strengthening of nuclear capability in a generation, the government has said. Stammer will be telling his allies in The Hague that the new squadron will join an alliance mission that can be armed with US nuclear weapons. It's not exactly hard to see the diplomacy that's going on there. Nuke diplomacy also to consolidate  NATO's relations with the US. And it is a big overhaul of our nuclear deterrent. Interesting that the arguments about that have largely gone quiet. It's just, please, can we get some more of it as far as the government is concerned and how that can be afforded. But the main focus today is what the government will be doing between now and Tuesday.  And Sam, a bit more, please, on what you're hearing. I think your mobile phone is just buzzing every five minutes for what you've got."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 359.682, "text": "Well, people just don't know how this government is going to get through the next few days in an area that's pretty central. Because if they muck this up, then there could be judgment ultimately by the markets if there are big holes in the government's budget.  The stakes are really quite high. This is a test of whether the government is in control of its party and in control of the agenda. So there's a lot riding on the next few days. So the first thing to say is that  In every conversation yesterday and indeed in the early hours of this morning, it is quite clear lots of people are reeling. And it hurts your head that we are less than a year into Keir Starmer's government, and there is a rebellion by one in four Labour MPs. One in four Labour MPs being publicly disloyal.  What if all Labour MPs telling their constituents that they're going to kill a welfare bill that they are being told by the Chancellor and the Prime Minister is essential, right? Now, even if there is a way through in the next few days, and in a moment we'll talk about possible compromises and off-ramps and all the rest of it, even if that happens, this is just a massive bruise that's not going to be forgotten. There are people in the Labour Party who are now publicly, perfectly prepared to say that they will challenge Keir Starmer. So many of them, Anne,  are new MPs, and I think that's one of the shocks that is reverberating around. This is an indictment of Keir Starmer's political operation. Now, Downing Street denied that there is  finger-pointing. I can tell you, Anne, there is finger-pointing like crazy going on at the moment about how things appear to have got things wrong, because nobody saw this coming. Number 10 and the whips only found out on Monday that one in four Labour MPs was planning to publicly challenge this government.  So, as we were reporting yesterday, there was no little bit of extra intelligence at the centre on this. Now, one source tells me that one cabinet minister did know it was coming and chose to not pass this on. I don't think number 10  think that's true, but I am told that. But again, you would expect of the 30 members of the cabinet, one of them might get an inkling about the size of this rebellion. But there's a sort of, never mind the kind of who knew what over the last few days, much more important is the real thing, which is,  I am told that Number 10 has been told for months about the level and the number and the depths of the problem over this bill, but buried their head in the sand. Number 10 reject that. Somebody told me Keir Starmer has been shielded from reality as to the problem.  One member of the government yesterday who I was talking to was pointing the finger at the number 10 political operations, that's the political secretary Claire Reynolds, the PPS, people like Chris Ward, wondering why they hadn't done a better job of seeing this coming. It's literally their job to know that a rebellion like this is about to hit.  yet Downing Street confirmed they only knew on Monday. Now, the names of the people who have put their, you know, alongside the 13 select committee chairs and people like Meg Hillier, the school gate mum that you were talking about yesterday, are, so many of them are what we were saying last year were hand-picked Starm troopers, i.e. people who were made Labour MPs because they were going to be loyal to Keir Starmer and now are on the list.  amongst possibly the most toxic bits of finger pointing that I'm hearing is that there are some who are looking to point the finger at the chief whip, Alan Campbell, and the whips more generally. And the moment a government has a bit of a row between the leadership and the whips, it's really, really, really, it's one of those ghostbusters crossing the streams moment, which can cause such a toxic explosion that you don't know where to look. And yet, there are some people picking up that dynamic again,  that isn't confirmed, and that's rejected by the Centre, but they would say that, wouldn't they? And loads of people are just now trying to quell this rebellion, but the question is, are there people around Keir Starmer who just are going to say, look, let's delay, let's push this off because we can't have a confrontation on Tuesday, the results in us losing, but there are lots and lots of stubborn people. And as we've seen from Keir Starmer's interviews yesterday, sometimes the most stubborn of all is the Prime Minister himself."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 630.802, "text": " If, like me, you're slightly confused about the Ghostbusters crossing the stream moment there from Sam, I think we still get the sense of it. And one of the things that I was hearing last night, Sam, I was out and about and there were a couple of Labour people at the event, I was at was this head in the sand was the phrase that you used in Downing Street or collective heads in the number 10 sand. And this was actually from an MP who's very loyal to the government and even  it has concerns about aspects of the bill but would never dream of making Keir Starmer's life difficult about it, but does believe that the welfare state needs massive reform and you have to take the pain, but just said the problem is that those at the  the top, all those in the inner circle, in number 10 was the suggestion of this MP loyalist, who said they don't understand how difficult it is getting for the rest of us. So you talked about the one in four rebelling, but a lot of the others who are saying we are taking a lot of pain about this. We need more direct engagement by the Prime Minister to basically help us, to support us in making the argument. A minister also told Politico Playbook this morning that the government will need to make concessions  water down the legislation. We need to find a way out and compromise, they said. Well, that's very odd, isn't it? When I think you reflected at the top of your last comments there, Sam, that this is, you know, we thought we would be here a year ago when we all talked about how big that Labour majority was. It may have been thinly won and thinly spread, but it is, in working terms, a really substantial majority. So to find  yourself in trouble a year in with a majority like that would signal, as well as what one thinks about the legislation, that something in the political operation is awry. And I think you're absolutely right that it's going to be quite a blame passing. It would be really, I think, unproductive to start blaming or sound leaking that you're blaming  the whips in the whips office now once you get that divide between the whips and number 10 on a big piece of legislation that just makes things worse. What can we expect today? Well certainly Conservative benches will have a bit of spring in their step and let's expect the Tories to needle Angela Rayner at PMQs today and ask her, she's standing in for Keir Starmer of course because he's out of the country, what her stance is going to be and try and force her to take  a public stance on this. She's usually the darling of the soft left and even to an extent lefty left of the party. How strongly is she going to make the case on behalf of the Prime Minister when this is wildly unpopular across large swathes of Labour?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 798.691, "text": " I am told that, privately, Angela Reynolds is on board, right? And she's on board with not only the plan, but also the efforts to try and get MPs on side. So I don't think the Conservatives will be able to open up a sort of cigarette paper on that. There's one saving grace here, Anne, and the question is, is the political operation in Number 10 smart enough to be able to navigate it?  and which is the consequences of this all going to a vote on Tuesday and the government losing are devastating.  But it is not the case, I think, that all 127 Labour MPs actually want to kill this government by taking it to that point. This is a gigantic game of chicken. I mean, it's highly enjoyable for people who are Westminster watchers. I don't think it's that enjoyable for number 10. But this is a gigantic game of chicken to see who can move. And because the consequences for the market of blowing up to five billion pound black hole are really, really, really serious,  The argument that's going to be made to the people who have put their names down on the Louise Hague amendment, which kills the bill, is game over. This isn't officially a vote of confidence, as we were saying, and as Keir Starmer was saying in interviews yesterday.  But it does really rupture everything we're trying to do. It hobbles this government and will render it ineffective. And just another kind of rowing party of government, like we've seen from the Tories the last 14 years. It really is bad. Do you want to do that to Keir Starmer? And I think in their heart of hearts, not all of them, and probably not 50 of them, but possibly there are not more than 80-odd  Labour MPs willing to try and kill the government, in other words, enough to bring it down, given the size of the majority. Can you find an off-ramp in that circumstance? Is there a way, in particular, that you could change the sequencing of events, so delay the introduction of the cuts until there's a better sense of what the additional support is that would get people back into work, which is the Treasury's claim of why you're not going to get so many people who are disabled pushed into poverty? Bring forward the money to help  people get into work, and maybe you're talking about some kind of argument. But in order to do that, you are going to have to delay the bill, right? So number 10 is going to have to swallow pain in order to find a compromise that ultimately gets there and finds the savings. But that means swallowing pride as well, and they're not going to like doing that. But it's not a government that ultimately has ended up worrying too much about U-turns."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 963.627, "text": " Yes, I think you're right about that. And probably there is a division inside that large number of rebels broadly between those who are just, in principle, outraged about the kind of whole working thesis of these cuts, where they're targeted, et cetera. You know, broadly take the view you're targeting the more vulnerable in society. And a quite sizable number who accept that this bill is out of control, the wealth end. Sorry, I mean, the money bill, the amount of money spent.  on welfare and the large rise in disability claims and also for mental health conditions where there's a case to be made that they could be handled differently, more productively for people's lives by getting them into work and supporting them. So I think you're right that a lot of people just want changes rather than to obliterate it. But there is still, I think, a problem there, Sam, in what you're pointing out, particularly for someone like Liz Kent,  this up in charge of welfare, that the argument the government made, if you remember when they introduced this, was this is not about saving money primarily. This is not driven by just by the treasury needing to save some billions here and there. This will be better for people. This is a welfare reform we wanted to do anyway. Well, a few people actually believed that.  of face value. But the more you then start to say, well, actually, all right, we can delay this or we can scrabble some money together here. Difficult for Rachel Reeves. She'll be getting rather fed up with that. It keeps happening, right? But it also does mean that the message, the central message of the government gets watered down.

Now, I wonder how many of them work in Westminster. I can quite see interviewers asking cabinet ministers whether they're part of the 3%. Many, many fun and games coming. But one of the things I think the 10-year plan has been wrestling with, given that the emphasis of this government is meant to be on prevention, is what do we do about it?  Now, they have been mulling a number of plans, and in the 10-year plan draft, so not the final version, there are numbers. I've seen some stuff in what's known as square brackets, which means here are some ideas that are up for discussion. Now, some of them haven't made it through, I'm told. One of the things they were thinking about was minimum alcohol pricing, which is what we've got in Scotland.  and they were actively looking at that in this document. I have, in the last hour, been told that is not in the final plan. So it was discussed, it was looked at, but there's attacks, attacks arguably on working people that has disappeared from the document.

There'll have to be big consultations. There'll be a big backlash, but that's quite a big deal as well.  They also considered restricting the hours for shops and off-licenses. Again, I'm told that's not in there. So of the various things that they considered, the more dramatic, arguably the more impactful stuff has disappeared. We'll wait and see about the total or partial advertising ban. But all these things were in drafts of the 10-year NHS plan. Is it that they just lost their nerve?

Another, to reflect on the past 24 hours, was inconclusive. And I think that's key. There are different ways to look at what's happened over the past few days. Trump got a result. He got a win. That's true. He forced Israel and Iran to back down. And I think that was a reflection of his clout.  He always likes high stakes games, doesn't he? He's unconventional, yes. He's full of jeopardy, of course. But very often, a lot of what he does is inconclusive. It's about the quick fix. And in the context of Iran, the Iran problem is far from over.

That's from one of three sources.  This assessment is already finding that these core pieces are still intact. That's a bad sign for the overall programme.

You know, for me, this whole episode is kind of in playbook Trump, it's reminiscent, in a way of Trump style on other issues like tariffs, he inserts himself into the moment, he elevates a crisis, he brings everyone to the brink. And then because he does have power and leverage, he defuses it all again, he claims a win, he pumps his chest, he projects power. As I say, we can't take away from Trump, the fact that he did stop all this, he stopped a war,  albeit maybe temporarily, he certainly didn't solve the underlying problems. But stopping the war, calling these two leaders, getting them to come to heel, that is a projection of power. But if with the tariff issue, he simply returned countries to the place where they were before he became president, he is slowly doing that. Well, then I think with the Iran crisis, you could argue that he's actually made matters worse than they were before.  because it's probable that Iran will no longer comply with the nuclear inspectors, who may well be kicked out soon. And the principal focus now of the Iranian regime is now more than ever survival. And I'm sure they will attach themselves to China and to Russia.  tighter than they ever have done before. There is of course though James another view to all this and I think it's worth considering. It was articulated very well because he does articulate himself well by J.D. Vance, the vice president. He said on social media of course  He said, we're seeing a foreign policy doctrine develop that will change the country and the world for the better. Number one, he said, clearly define an American interest. Number two, negotiate aggressively to achieve that interest. Number three, use overwhelming force if necessary.

There can be no peace between Iran and Israel until Iran decides to change her policy, which is the regime policy of destroying the state of Israel and killing all the Jews. Until that changes, nothing really changes. The program has been decimated, but the people who are in charge will come right back at Israel.

So regime change can come in a couple of ways. You can replace the people with folks in Iran who don't want to kill all the Jews, which I think are most people. Or you can get the regime to change its behavior until the regime  recognizes Israel's right to exist, this problem doesn't go away. So, to me, a prerequisite to any negotiations after the cease-fire should be acknowledgment by Iran that they've abandoned their policy of destroying the state of Israel. They're now willing to live with Israel. They can have grievances against Israel. They can have concerns about Israel policy. But they have to abandon the goal of killing all the Jews in Israel.

As you can see from the map here, about 640 million acres are controlled by the federal government across our country, about half of that in the Forest Service.  These restrictions made it harder to fight wildfires, protect public safety, and manage our forests responsibly. When government puts up gates and keeps people out from doing forest practices that are positive, or even being able to get in and fight fire because the roads are disappearing, it's a bad deal for all of us.  The rule was pushed through in the final days of the Clinton administration, backed by environmental activists in Washington, not the people that actually live near these forests and suffer from the smoke and the threat. This led to overgrown, unhealthy forests and prevented rural counties from using this land to create jobs and have the income to their local government for schools and roads and reduced fire risk. Repeating the roadless rule is a  important step towards restoring this entry we would need to our lands, improving wildfire response, and bringing back common sense to forest management.

Our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target and worked perfectly. The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran, so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the president and the successful mission.

And the fact that they were carried out without any casualties to the forces involved is really nothing short of remarkable.  There's no question that there has been very, very significant damage done to all of the known nuclear sites within Iran. And I suspect that this has indeed set the program back much, much more than many months. But the bomb damage assessment process does need to be complete to validate that. And that's a very challenging one, especially if  A lot of the damage was done inside a mountain at Fordow, which is, of course, the most important enrichment site when it comes to enriching to the higher levels that were reached, over 60 percent called highly enriched uranium, from which it's pretty quick to go to weapons grade. And, of course, that was one of the real concerns here.  But we need to ensure that there is not highly enriched uranium that was moved from one of the sites in which it was stored, not centrifuged somewhere else, not another site underground about which there have been rumors from time to time. So, again, I would allow this bomb damage assessment process to play itself out. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I think, was correct when he said there was severe damage, no question about that. But now we need to see how much that really has been.  But again, I'm quite confident that this has set back the program very, very substantial amount of time, undoubtedly years, especially given that this wasn't just again against facilities.

The reason I say it's important to focus on both of those elements is for peace to maintain, at least United States staying out of this war, it has to be assured that we accomplished our goal.

They say this, a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment has determined that U.S. strikes over the weekend on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's program by only a matter of months. That's according to three sources to Reuters that the initial report was prepared by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's main intelligence arm, and one of 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. According to two of the sources,  who requested anonymity here. This is being described as a low confidence intelligence assessment here. What's going on? President Trump, Secretary Hagsath and others say there's no way Iran can restart their nuclear program. The Defense Intelligence Agency disagreeing. Why?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 227.894, "text": " First, let's just note that when you start seeing leaked intelligence and interim assessments, it's politicized. Somebody has an agenda, and I don't know what that agenda is, but I don't think that we should be looking at this one assessment as the only assessment.  Right. There is this battle damage assessment that we've all been waiting for. There was the first one that came out, you know, something like 12 hours after the initial attack. And we saw Pete Hegsath, our secretary of defense, alongside his generals talking about what they thought was achieved in these strikes. There should be a couple of revisions over time. And I think what we will see from the DIA will be integrated into whatever that final assessment ultimately ends up looking like. As for the program itself,  Let's just review what's gone on here. I mean, the Israelis destroyed a massive amount of above ground infrastructure relating to the nuclear program. On top of that, we know that the Israelis assassinated no less than 14 nuclear scientists, as well as individuals that were involved in the administration.  of this Iranian nuclear program. Then you have the Trump administration ordering these B-2s to drop the mops, the massive ordnance penetrators, these bunker busting weapons on three different sites. It's really hard for me to imagine that the Iranians are just going to bounce back from all of this.  Now, we do know that there were trucks that lined up outside one of the facilities and they may have carried off some of that 60% enriched uranium. That is a scenario that I think folks are still grappling with. I think that there probably are still some secret facilities that the Iranians never declared, but that should be a good indication  of who we're dealing with here. This is a regime that we could never trust and probably necessitated, at the end of the day, the kind of attacks that the Trump administration carried out and that the Israelis carried out. But I think the last thing that I would just stress here is that the Iranian regime now knows what happens.  when it engages in this kind of illicit nuclear activity, it will invite the Iranians to get struck by the Israelis, by the United States. And I think what we've watched over the last 12 days is that the Israelis could do so with impunity.  the United States could do so with impunity. And I got to think that that is a huge deterrent for the regime. Some may say that, well, this is the exact reason why Iran will make a dash for a nuclear weapon. I'll just say that is a terrible risk right now for the regime if they try to go down that path.  very closely right now for any false move that they can discern by the Islamic Republic."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 399.2, "text": "Okay, let's just kind of flesh out though some of the reporting because there's a lot here on this. You were citing that could be political in nature with someone that has an agenda. The White House and the Pentagon really strongly and vehemently opposing these reports. Ayesha Hasni quote tweets Secretary Hagseth's statement at the Pentagon  He says this, based on everything we've seen, and I've seen it all, our bombing campaign obliterated Iran's ability to create nuclear weapons. Our massive bombs hit exactly the right spot at each target and worked perfectly. The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran. So anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the president and the successful mission.  Caroline Leavitt, though, at the White House saying this, fake news CNN strikes again. She says this alleged assessment, in quotes, is flat out wrong. And it was classified as top secret, but was still leaked to CNN by an anonymous low-level loser in the intelligence community. The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program. Everyone knows what happens  when he dropped 14 30,000-pound bombs perfectly on their targets. Total obliteration. You know, Jonathan, I put the before and after satellite imagery at the Fordow nuclear site there. Let's put this back up. Jennifer Griffin has a little bit more reporting.  She, in her reporting, says this assessment was deemed low confidence. That's intelligence parlance. She says it's based on satellite images and signals intelligence obtained since the strike. She says the focus of the report is on the battle damage assessment at Fordow, which we're seeing right now, that the U.S. B-2 MOP Bunker Buster bombs were able to cave the entrances to the facility, which is built 300 feet underground. She says the entrances  are caved in. Some infrastructure was destroyed, according to the assessment, but the overall operations were not destroyed. And they could, quote-unquote, dig out and rebuild and repair the power to the facility that powered the centrifuges. She reports this, that according to this assessment, an unknown amount of the highly enriched uranium was moved out of the Fordow facility. To your point, Jonathan. And she says, one possibility, according to the DIA assessment,  is that it was moved to the third site that the Iranians told the IAEA about ahead of the strikes. That's a secret site. And of course, DIA is one of these 18 U.S. intelligence agencies. So just kind of wanted to flesh this out. To your point, though, Jonathan, if Iranians were to restart their nuclear program, they have to start at square one, don't they? Or no?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 567.571, "text": " I mean, let's put it this way. I don't know how many centrifuges they're gonna be able to pull out of Fordo and be able to use. I don't know which scientists are going to work on this program. And I also know that if the Israelis begin to see any activity in or around these sites, and they try to start digging out, and they try to reconnect it to the grid,  You don't think that the Israeli Air Force is going to scramble those F-35s and start doing more damage again? Because the Iranian regime still doesn't have air defenses, last time I checked. And last time I checked, the Israelis had flown hundreds of sorties in the skies over Iran because they  were no air defenses left for the regime to use. And so, you know, it's just really hard for me to imagine that in a matter of two or three months that, you know, the nuclear program is back humming along again. I don't want to say that this is simple, and I don't think that it's an open and shut case. There are things that I think we still need to chase down. Whether the regime was able to carry out that enriched uranium, that seems to me something that we  We all need to get a handle on right now. And yeah, I think it'd be great to try to figure out whether these mobs did everything that they were supposed to do or whether there's follow up work that may be needed, whether by the Israelis or by someone else, maybe forces on the ground for that matter. But I don't see this as a failed mission. I think it's very clear that when you look at what the Israelis did before the United States came in and what the United States did after the Israelis had  paved the way for all of this work to get done. I see a nuclear program in shambles. I see a regime that was shamed on the world stage. I mean, they were upstaged by the Israelis for 12 days before the U.S. even came in to do any of this work.  And so I just it's really hard for me to believe that this was a complete failure based on everything that we've seen and what we're hearing from the White House. They're pushing back pretty emphatically. And look, some of this, of course, is bluster. We know that, you know, on the part of the Iranians and maybe even a little bit on the part of the White House after carrying out these attacks.

I'm still watching to see whether we see attacks in the United States, asymmetric attacks, terrorist attacks on the homeland. There's a lot that I think could still go wrong here. But I will tell you this, that no matter what happens,  We have a challenge that we need to deal with as it relates to Iran. They've got their proxies that need to be neutralized around the region. They've got a nuclear program that they need to relinquish, and they need to announce that they're giving up on this. They've got a ballistic missile program  that still needs to be dealt with because we can see the damage that that was able to do in Israel over the last several days. It was pretty rough out there.

These are the two greatest enemies, declared enemies of this really horrific  dictatorial, apocalyptic regime. And so for them to see defeat to the two countries that they call the great Satan and the little Satan, that's a difficult pill for them to swallow. But there are a couple of things that we're still watching right now. Number one, you had the crown prince of the previous regime that fell in 1979,  came out in Paris the other day and called for the Iranian people to rise up. So there is this sort of interesting question of whether the people now sensing that this current regime is weak, that it was unable to fend off these attacks by Israel and then the United States, there is the possibility for a revolution of sorts. And I'll be watching that very closely. I also think that there is a possibility that the Supreme Leader, as he calls himself, Ali Khamenei,  He may have lost the confidence of the ranks below him. I know that if I was answering to a man that had just lost as badly as he just did, I think I'd probably start to question the leadership of this man. He's clearly led the country to ruin.  In many ways, the damage that was delivered to this regime is going to take years to bounce back from. Set aside the nuclear program for a minute and just understand the economic damage, the damage to production of not just military platforms and munitions, but also gas and oil.  and other key assets of the regime that they have used to hold power. A lot of that is now in rubble. And I've got to wonder whether people underneath the Supreme Leader are beginning to question his leadership. And I think that would be a very positive thing as well. We've got a lot of unknowns that we're still watching for. And right now,  I don't think anybody really knows how to answer them, certainly not the DIA alone.

Seemingly so."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1145.32, "text": " No, look, it's not back to normal. Let's just remember something here. This was a war that began on October 7th of 2023. And it started with the Hamas attack. And then the next thing you know, Hezbollah is firing at Israel. You got Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria firing at Israel. You got the Houthis firing at Israel. You've got unrest in the West Bank. And then you've got Iran itself.  Now, I think it's really important that Israel finally took it to the epicenter of this campaign that's being waged against it. And that center, you know, we call it the head of the octopus, right? Israel was dealing with all these tentacles, and I think they chopped a lot of them off.  Then they went to the head of the octopus and they started taking it to Iran as well. When you look around the region right now, you see a lot of weakened Iranian proxies. You see a weakened regime, but they are still acting like they still have something left in the tank.  I mean, the attack on Al Udeid on that base in Qatar the other day, it was perfunctory. It was for messaging alone. They had telegraphed the entire thing to ensure that there were no deaths and no injuries and that these missiles would be shot down. They wanted to be able to project strength to their own people. So they're still perpetuating this fiction that they're in control.  And as long as they're able to do that, as long as they're still fronting that they have strength, we're not out of the woods. And I do think that the Israelis are going to have to think about what it looks like to elicit a complete capitulation, whether that's even possible. I don't know if it is, but for right now, at any rate, we have weakened Iranian proxies and a weakened regime itself.  But the war has not ended. Israel is still fighting in Gaza. Israel is still on alert in Iran. But let's just be very clear. The Israelis, starting from October 7th, were flat on their back. They were surprised. I mean, it looked like it was a knockout, crippling blow.  When you think about what's happened over the last 600 plus days, how they have gotten back up and started taking it to their enemies one at a time, and ultimately arrived in Tehran and dominated the skies, total air superiority for 12 days. And now there is no real threat of a nuclear program anytime real soon. And when you look at their military, there's no air force  in Iran. There's no air defenses in Iran. It's a game changer.

Give them a round of applause.  They were really fantastic. I want to thank Mayor Bloomberg, who stepped forward in a big way. I enjoyed having the team back together again. I'll tell you the truth, people came back from when I was at HUD. The old HUD team came back. That's 30 years ago.  and the attorney general team, that's 20 years ago, and the governor's team, and friends that go back to my childhood. So, it was, that was all, that was all enjoyable, and I'm very proud of the campaign that we ran, and I'm proud of the effort that we put forth, and I'm proud of the issues that we discussed.  But tonight was not our night. Tonight was Assemblyman Mondani's night and he put together a great campaign and he touched young people and inspired them and moved them and got them to come out and vote. And he really ran a highly impactful campaign.  I called him, I congratulated him, I applaud him sincerely for his effort and let's give him a round of applause and thank him for his campaign.  Now, I want to look at all the numbers as they come in and this ranked choice voting and what the numbers actually say and do. There is no doubt that there are important issues that are facing this city. That's why this election is so imperative. That's why so many people came out to vote.  Because these are real issues, and they're not getting better, and they're getting worse. And that's why New Yorkers are as concerned as they are. So the challenges we face are real, and they deserve real consideration.  And I want to give some thought about the best way to help address them, the best way to help the party, but most of all, the best way to help the city. And that's what we'll be thinking about as we go forward.  So we'll be looking at that and we'll be having conversations with that because the work is what is most important and the city is what is most important and the progress for the city at this important time is what is most important. And in the meantime I just want to say thank you again from the bottom of my heart for your really fantastic effort in friendship  Again, I want to applaud the Assemblyman for a really smart and good and impactful campaign.

When he calls America the great Satan, I believe him. And there's a reason the Ayatollah is developing ICBMs. As you know, ICBM stands for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.  You don't need an ICBM for Iran to attack Israel. They're using ordinary ballistic missiles for that. The only reason that the Ayatollah wants an ICBM is to deliver a nuclear warhead to an American city and Donald Trump act decisively to prevent that and to prevent Iran from being able to kill potentially millions of American citizens.  I don't know why CNN is not cheering that on. I don't know why every Democrat is not cheering that on, but they immediately take the side of America's enemies instead of standing and supporting our nation."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 209.175, "text": "All right.

All right, the White House says they called Hakeem Jeffries to give him a heads up about the airstrikes, but he didn't pick up the phone. In his defense, nobody ever called him on a Saturday night. Let's keep rolling. All right.  After Russia suggested that they may supply Iran with nuclear weapons, Trump asked if they were casually throwing around the N-word, nuclear. Personally, all I can say is, Mr. President, you my nuclear. Pete Hedgeth said the airstrikes gave Iran's nuclear program a final blow.  It works so well, they're calling it Operation Stormy Daniels. All right. Georgia Democrat Hank Johnson posted an awful out-of-tune version of Jimi Hendrix's song, Hey Joe. Would tell him not to quit his day job, but he sucks at that too.  According to a new study, about half of the women say they want children aren't confident they'll actually ever have them. Fortunately, help is on the way.

Researchers now say recycled plastic can be even more toxic than new plastic. And here's the proof. Look, you can't say it's that old thing because it's a new pitcher. Changed it up.  Still terrible. A former Biden staffer said Kamala Harris would not have had the courage to blow up Iran's nuclear facilities, but she would be interested in Jaeger bombs. And finally, McDonald's and Krispy Kreme are ending their partnership. Over our dead bodies, said these men,  And of course, I meant men as in mankind. All right, let's do some stories.

In a moment or two, we'll take a look at the Fed's path with Joanne Bianco, senior investment strategist at BondBlocks. But we begin this morning with geopolitics.  Israel and Iran have spent the better part of the past two weeks exchanging strikes, and in the process, the U.S. was drawn into this conflict. The situation highlights the role of another power player, though, China. Joining me now is Jenny Marsh. Jenny is Greater China EcoGov team leader for Bloomberg News, and she joins us from our studios.  in Hong Kong. It's always a pleasure to benefit from your perspective. And as long as we're talking about geopolitics, let's talk about what's going on between the U.S., Israel and Iran. Now, after the strikes, the recent strikes by the U.S. government on Iranian nuclear facilities, Beijing issued a strong condemnation and basically called it a violation of the U.N. charter and of international law.  I'm wondering whether or not China may have played a role in this. Do you have a sense of that?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 114.823, "text": "My sense is that China very much here will be remembered for sitting on the sidelines. You know, like they issued this very strong statement condemning the U.S. and they talked about how America was sort of blowing up, you know, the international system for sort of maintaining order, i.e. the U.S.-led, you know, U.N. framework for resolving conflicts.  And before the US strikes, you know, Xi and Putin had got on the phone and sort of worked out this four point plan for peace. But really, for China, they kind of left it at diplomacy. And I don't think, you know, they were particularly effective in what they were messaging.  We know that Wang Yi spoke to both the Israeli and the Iranian foreign ministers. So there was some sort of attempt at sort of backchanneling. But essentially, you know, Tehran, you know, China is one of Tehran's sort of strongest partners. And when it came to its darkest hour, China really didn't do much apart from call for peace."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 175.677, "text": "Is it pretty much a selfish move that boils down to crude oil? Is that really what this is about this relationship?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "China"], "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 183.445, "text": " I think this relationship is about the US. And I think one of the reasons I say that is, yes, China is one of the places that will buy sanctioned Iranian oil. It's a very, very slim percentage of China's oil supplies, about 10%.  And they can easily source this oil from other places. And I think, you know, there's a couple of practical reasons why these sort of, it's mainly sort of these teapot refineries in northern China that take this oil. It's much cheaper. But also, I think the Chinese government tolerates it because they are vehemently opposed to the US sanctions regime.  And so they let this go as a way of sort of defying the U.S. sanctions regime, which is something they and Russia and Iran are all united in opposing. But I think the broader relationship with Iran has been about sort of finding partners that will join hands with Beijing and challenge the U.S. sub-world order.  And I think you can see that through, you know, she has ushered Iran into the BRICS group of emerging markets, which is this block that it's expanding with India and South Africa and Brazil as sort of a kind of a rival framework to the G20. It also welcomed Iran in the last couple of years into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is another sort of grouping that it's expanding, which has more of a security flavor.  But when it comes to sort of trade with Iran, I mean, the trade is very, very, isn't significant. It doesn't sell much to Iran. Actually, trade with Iran actually fell off in the first four months of this year. It was down about 20%. And the broader Middle Eastern region, from a Belt and Road perspective, is more important to Beijing. So I think, really, this was sort of a partnership of convenience. And for China, it was always about finding partners  that will join hands with it to stand against the US."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China"], "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 297.301, "text": " So to that point, maybe China is not solely reliant on Iranian crude oil. I get the fact that they're only going to import, let's say, 10%. But the Strait of Hormuz, I would imagine, is perhaps more critical. And if there were a way for Beijing to become influential in dialing down a lot of this tension just so that the conflict didn't extend into the Strait, is that part of the thinking here as well?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China"], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 324.807, "text": " Yeah, so I think the Strait of Hormuz is definitely a different story and a much more alarming concern for China. About 45% of its oil shipments come through that strait and China is the country that is most dependent on the oil coming through that waterway globally.  So, yeah, massive exposure there. That being said, China has been stockpiling on oil. So, if there was a crisis that closed the strait for a short period of time, it wouldn't feel the immediate impact. But in the long term, absolutely doesn't want this conflict to spiral. And I think that was the message  from the four-point plan that she put forward. He talked about not wanting this to expand. And when they were condemning the US, they were saying the US was fanning the flames of war and would be to blame, essentially, if this did become a broader conflict. I think the problem for China is,  how can it affect, how can it, or what is it willing to do to stop it from becoming a broader conflict? And the answer is not very much. You know, China doesn't like to get its hands dirty in foreign conflicts. It definitely doesn't go anywhere near the U.S. playbook of these sort of faraway wars and military operations. And even with Russia, which it has a much stronger trade relationship and sort of interdependency with, and Russia has now overtaken Saudi as the top supplier of crude oil to China.  even when Putin went to war in Ukraine, she was very careful not to do anything that would invite US sanctions. So yes, he stepped up economic support and diplomatic support. And then there was some controversy about sort of, you know, the dual use items that have been shipped, but never any direct, you know, military support that would cross these red lines that America and Europe laid out very clearly. You know, and I think China is a country, you have to remember that has no formal allies.  by design, you know, and its self-interest will always be its sort of North Star of what it does when these kind of conflicts break out."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China"], "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 446.068, "text": "Do we want to include North Korea even at the fringe?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China"], "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 450.034, "text": "Yeah, North Korea is the closest that China does have to an ally. And obviously, in the 1950s, it did go to war for the North Koreans. But it's still today. I mean, it doesn't want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. China has a non-proliferation policy.  You know, and ties between Xi and Kim have been sort of entering this frostier period over recent years. And we've seen then North Korea become closer to Putin.

And it hasn't been as prominent as you might have thought, sort of broadly towards American people. The Minecraft movie came out in China and did pretty well. And we've seen other sort of examples of sort of American soft power being powerful, even though the US and China are locked in this trade war.  I almost wonder if the Chinese people sort of are able to separate Trump and, you know, the aberration or, you know, that is Trump from the average American people. There were people talking about, you know, how foolish Iran had been to sort of trust the U.S. saying, you know, the U.S. came in to negotiate, then its ally hit Iran, and then the U.S. hit Iran. You know, the Iranians were fools forever trusting America. So there was a lot of that kind of sentiment.  But I think actually the Chinese people sort of, it is not this sort of like rise in nationalism. And I think that is partly because the Chinese government has learned from the first time around, the first trade war, you had this wolf warrior policy that really stoked up a lot of bad feeling. Then you had sort of people like Hu Sijin, the old, the former editor in chief of the Global Times, who were allowed to sort of really run wild on social media. You know, when Nancy Pelosi was flying into Taiwan, he was,  posting things about, you know, perhaps shooting down, you know, the jet as she came in, which obviously just was a step too far. And I think this time, the nationalist voices on social media and state media have been tampered down because the government doesn't want it to get out of control to a point where they are not the ones managing the narrative."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "China", "Apple"], "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 603.717, "text": " Jenny, it's always a pleasure.

Today, bombs landing, targets exploding. Inside the tense hours that nearly derailed President Trump's push for a ceasefire, Iran's deadly strikes on Israel, the president's urgent calls for Israel not to strike back.  They came out and they dropped a load of bombs the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. I'm not happy with Iran either.  Plus, our new reporting on the B-2 mission and initial damage report finding the bombings were not as effective as President Trump claimed. Deadly heat wave, more than 150 million sweltering under an unrelenting heat dome, pavement buckling across the Midwest. In some places, the power is out as thousands wait for the AC to come back on. The Washington Monument shut down too hot to visit as hurricane season gets fired up in the Atlantic.  Sucked out at 16,000 feet, the near disaster aboard that Alaska Airlines flight, a plane in the air with a massive hole. Tonight, we're learning the one employee that knew how to install that door plug properly was on vacation. Alligator Alcatraz inside the new migrant detention center being built in the Everglades. Florida's AG saying alligators and pythons will be waiting for anyone who escapes.  And Cliffhanger, the semi-driver, hanging on for dear life as his truck dangles over a rock ledge. This is NBC Nightly News with Tom Llamas.  And good evening. Tonight, a fragile ceasefire holding as new questions emerge about the impact of those US airstrikes. NBC News reporting tonight that the American strikes on those three Iranian nuclear facilities only set back Iran's nuclear program by three to six months. That according to one preliminary intelligence assessment. The White House now calling this initial assessment flat out wrong.  President Trump rebuking both Israel and Iran today over their actions in the tenuous hours as his ceasefire agreement was about to start. Though blows between Iran and Israel were traded just before the deal, with the IDF targeting an Iranian missile launcher and Iran delivering a deadly strike on an apartment building in Israel. We've got our team covering it all from Israel to the Netherlands, where we start with Kelly O'Donnell.  Tonight, President Trump in the Netherlands for the NATO summit, wielding a diplomatic win on the world stage, with the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Iran still holding. The ceasefire is very much in effect.  And I think we're going to keep it there for a long time. The president projected more confidence that the U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, which included B-2 bombers, 14 bunker buster bombs, delivered a fateful blow. Photos before and after appear to show significant destruction at the sites.  However, in a new development tonight, a preliminary assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that the Iranian nuclear program has been delayed by three to six months, according to three people with knowledge of the report. The White House disputes that initial assessment, calling it flat out wrong. Iran will never rebuild its nuclear. From there, absolutely not. That place is under rock. That place is demolished. The B-2 pilots did their job.  And this tonight from the director of the UN's nuclear watchdog."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 215.277, "text": "What we see is a very important degree of damage.

The red carpet European welcome, quite a contrast to the blunt and profane way he left Washington today, furious over additional strikes by both Israel and Iran after he outlined his ceasefire plan.  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing. In flight on Air Force One, he recounted a tense call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.  Behind the scenes, a senior White House official says the president, over the past 48 hours, had called Netanyahu with a clear demand, no more war. Then a trio of top officials, Vance, Rubio, and Whitkoff, were directed to reach out to Iran to deliver the message that a ceasefire was expected. And here at the NATO summit, the president shifts to a broader agenda of diplomacy.  And Kelly joins us now live. Kelly, let's go back to that initial assessment of the damage to Iran's nuclear sites. You have more reporting on the White House reaction?  And Tom, the White House is effectively saying, hold on. The Pentagon is still examining the consequences of the strikes. Also tonight, we're learning that for the first time, lawmakers have been able to see some of the analysis by intelligence agencies that is secure. And they were able to do that in a secure location. And that is a new development. Tom.  All right, Kelly O'Donnell for us. Kelly, thank you. All of this as there were some tense moments on the ground before President Trump's ceasefire plan took effect, including a deadly Iranian strike on Israel. Here's Richard Engel with the TikTok of how it happened. Around 520 AM in Israel this morning, it did not look like peace had a chance.  President Trump announced his ceasefire just a few hours ago, but these sirens mean that Iranian missiles are inbound. By 540.  One of those Iranian missiles slammed into an apartment building in Beersheba, in southern Israel. It was one of the deadliest attacks of the war against civilians. And this is where the missile exploded, destroying this entire floor of an apartment building, killing at least four people, and maybe killing the ceasefire before it even takes hold.  As recovery efforts were underway, Iran fired more missiles, this time after the ceasefire was in effect. Israel quickly vowed revenge for both attacks, scrambling its jets, until President Trump publicly rebuked both sides. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land,  Israeli jets dropped a bomb on a radar station outside Tehran and turned back. Just a few hours later, President Trump's ceasefire began to hold.  The streets of Tel Aviv sprung back to life. A partial state of emergency banning school, work, and gatherings was lifted. And in Tehran, while Iran's military and nuclear program have been severely damaged, people poured into the streets for celebrations, cheering that Iran stood up to the US and Israel and remained standing. Richard, let's pick up right where you left off. This may be a positive sign for the ceasefire. Iran, Israel, and the US all declaring victory tonight.  Well, that's the way you want a ceasefire to go. Prime Minister Netanyahu got what he's long wanted, the United States to join an attack on Iran's nuclear program. President Trump didn't get sucked into an open-ended Middle East war. And while Iran is still standing, it's much weakened. Tom.  Richard Engel for us. Richard, thank you. Back here at home now to the sweltering temperatures. They have more than 150 million people under heat alerts from the Mississippi Valley to the East Coast.

And Sam Bragg joins us from the center of that heat wave. Sam, this heat could affect the history of New York City. It's election day here. Yeah, Tom, it's a red-hot Democratic primary on a day where some records, temperature-wise, are falling. Now, there was some concern initially, Tom, we could be losing power at the polls. We have received no reports of that so far. Also worth noting, ballot scanners have backup batteries. So even if the power does fail, those can last hours. Tom?  And it could be just too hot for some voters. All right, Sam Brock for us. I want to bring in Bill Cairns. Bill, such a brutal day there. So many records broken. And now we know the tropics are heating up as well. Yeah, we've got our A-name storm. But first, let's start with the numbers, because this wasn't your normal day. Boston ended up going up to 102 degrees, the hottest ever recorded in June.  And JFK Airport also went over 102. Philadelphia 101. Newark was 103. These are numbers that haven't been hitting over a decade in some cases. Tomorrow the sizzle continues, but we take it down just the notch. We'll have a dozen or so record highs by the time we get to Thursday and Friday. Everything will come back down. And as far as the tropics go, this is not a storm that any of us have to worry about. This is tropical storm.  way out in the Atlantic. Just a reminder that the season is here. Our next bee-named storm will be Barry, but there's no signs of that coming anytime soon. Okay, that's good news. We'll take it. Bill, we thank you for that. Now to a new migrant detention camp in the Florida Everglades. Officials there are calling it Alligator Alcatraz, suggesting the swamp's wildlife will prevent migrants from escaping. Here's Gabe Gutierrez.  Tonight, construction is underway deep in the Florida Everglades on a massive migrant detention camp that state officials are calling Alligator Alcatraz. Starting next month, 5,000 migrants will be housed in trailers and heavy-duty tents at this remote, abandoned airfield.  As I call it, alligator Alcatraz. In a promotional video set to music, Florida's attorney general lays out what he considers a deterrent for any potential escapees.

Trump said his bombing completely obliterated three key Iranian nuclear facilities.

The White House slamming that initial damage assessment.  This, as new polling from CNN finds, a majority of American adults disapprove of those strikes.

Kelly, let's go back to that preliminary damage assessment from the U.S. strike this weekend. You're getting more reaction from the White House?  Well, certainly, Tom, the White House is deeply invested in the success of this mission. The president used a lot of his capital to carry that out. And what they are saying is that the Pentagon is still analyzing the consequence of the strikes. Also important to note that there are lawmakers who have been eager for any kind of classified briefing about what happened and what the future path may be. And we're told tonight that some lawmakers have been given some access to initial reports, and they were able to view that in a classified setting. Tom?  All right, Kelly O'Donnell for us. Kelly, we thank you. All of this as there were tense moments on the ground before President Trump's fragile ceasefire plan took effect. NBC's Richard Engel is on the ground in Tel Aviv, where residents are quickly returning to everyday life.  Around 5.20 a.m. in Israel this morning, it did not look like peace had a chance. President Trump announced his ceasefire just a few hours ago, but these sirens mean that Iranian missiles are inbound. By 5.40...  One of those Iranian missiles slammed into an apartment building in Beersheba, in southern Israel. It was one of the deadliest attacks of the war against civilians. And this is where the missile exploded, destroying this entire floor of an apartment building, killing at least four people, and maybe killing the ceasefire before it even takes hold.  As recovery efforts were underway, Iran fired more missiles, this time after the ceasefire was in effect. Israel quickly vowed revenge for both attacks, scrambling its jets, until President Trump publicly rebuked both sides. I'm not happy with Iran either, but I'm really unhappy if Israel's going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land,  Israeli jets dropped a bomb on a radar station outside Tehran and turned back. Just a few hours later, President Trump's ceasefire began to hold.  The streets of Tel Aviv sprung back to life. A partial state of emergency banning school, work, and gatherings was lifted. And in Tehran, while Iran's military and nuclear program have been severely damaged, people poured into the streets for celebrations, cheering that Iran stood up to the U.S. and Israel and remained standing. All right, Richard, let's pick up right where you left off there. This may be a positive sign, right, for the ceasefire. You have Iran, Israel, and the U.S. all declaring victory.  And that's what you want for a ceasefire to hold, at least in the short term. Prime Minister Netanyahu got what he has long wanted, the United States to join him in an attack on Iran's nuclear program. President Trump didn't get sucked into an open-ended war in the Middle East and Iran is still standing, but much weaker. Tom.  OK, Richard Engel and his team from Tel Aviv tonight. Richard, we thank you. I do want to bring in Jason Rezaian. He's the director of press freedom initiatives for The Washington Post. He previously served as The Post's correspondent in Tehran and was unjustly imprisoned by Iranian authorities for 544 days and released in January of 2016. He's also a good friend to Top Story. Jason, it's been a while, but it is good to see you tonight. Talk to me about this ceasefire first.

I don't know how you square those two things together, and I assume that there will be a longer-term confrontation that we'll be dealing with, as we have for decades. But in the short term, I think this is a good sign and an opportunity for diplomacy to kind of do some of its magic, if all sides are willing to partake in that.  So the initial damage report, if you will, that has been leaked and first reported by CNN, The New York Times, and now NBC News, that the nuclear program was not completely obliterated. Rather, it was set back three to six months. Still a massive strike. Where does Iran go from here, do you think, with that information?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 616.137, "text": " if it's true well i think that the the yeah well at first of all when when president trump announced on saturday night that he had near made this order and that it was so successful in iran's nuclear program never come back we all had to take that with some skepticism because it was far too early to to make those kinds of assessments now that we know that they've been set back several months i think the question is what other capabilities of iran have to defend itself  It doesn't have the same missile capabilities that it started this war with."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 647.38, "text": "Its air defenses have been really destroyed over the last year or so. So I don't think that they necessarily want to risk running towards producing a bomb, although that's certainly a concern and something that people are looking at very closely.  This program has existed above ground and underground for years and years. But I think all eyes will be on Iran over the next six to eight months to see what they do. And I just don't see them wanting to risk another round of conflict in this way.  So you have reporting that the Ayatollah was hiding out in a bunker. He had sort of had his succession set up already with three people in line in case everybody was killed. And then you had both Netanyahu and Trump calling on the people of Iran essentially to rise up, to ask for a new government, to demand a new government. What do you think happens with the people of Iran? Does anything change?  Well, I appreciate you asking that, Tom, because I think that's the part of the conversation that we don't hear enough about. The vast majority of Iranian people do not like their leadership, do not want to live in a theocratic, authoritarian state, and would like to see some major changes. Many aspire to a secular democracy. That's not the sort of thing that you can bomb into existence.  At the same time, these bombs, the conflict, the lingering anxiety makes it really hard for people to spill out into the street when they're just trying to stay alive. So I think that the U.S. in particular has to look at this long term and do the kind of  civil society, democracy support that we've done in so many places, not in recent years, but throughout our history. Iran is ripe for that. People are desirous of a freer, liberal society, and we should help them get there.  All right, Jason, we thank you so much for coming on Top Story. I'm sure we'll have you booked again here very soon. We do want to bring it back here at home now to the U.S. sweltering under a record-smashing heat dome.

Sam Brock joins us tonight, Sam, I know you have some new reporting tonight about New York's power grid.  Yeah, Tom, that's right. New York ISO, which is the quasi state agency that oversees the grid, raised its alert level to an orange. What does that mean for those watching at home? It means they're not comfortable with the margins. They're asking consumers to be more judicious when it comes to energy usage. Now, Tom, it's not a red alert, which means that some customers would temporarily be taken off of the grid.  It's the stage before that, but obviously we've hit the peak already today. Things are expected to improve tomorrow, but it really does provide a framework for the fact that these were records that we saw today. Belvedere Castle, which is in Central Park, is the official weather station for New York City. Clocked at 99. The last time that happened was 2012, and it is a record breaker for this day, June 24th.  All right, Sam Brock, a lot of details there, we appreciate it. Let's get right to NBC News meteorologist Bill Cairns. Bill, it's a scorcher out there, right? What areas are breaking records and when could things finally cool off? Sam alluded to it a little bit there. Yeah, we still worry about, even at night, I mean the temperatures are so baked in right now that we're not going to get a lot of relief in the overnight hours and that's why we still have these extreme heat warnings that are still up through many of the regions.  So as far as our record heat, all the red dots on here show you where we had records broken. From Georgia all the way to Maine to northern portions of Vermont, 70 plus and they're still coming in. And some of the more impressive records, Boston hitting about 101 to 102 degrees. That hasn't happened in about 13 years. Hottest temperature ever in June. And Boston records go back to like the late 1800s, so the period of record is really long.  So as far as the extreme heat warnings go from Maine all the way down to North Carolina, we're going to get relief tonight and tomorrow in areas of the Ohio Valley, but not in the mid Atlantic region. We're still going to have record breaking heat tomorrow. Philadelphia is going to be near 100 once again. Same with DC to Richmond. Hartford will be a little bit cooler. Boston you'll be cooler too. The big relief sets in by the time we get to Thursday, Tom. That's what we'll be seeing temperatures in the 70s in northern and central New England and only only I say low 90s in the mid Atlantic.  Yeah, we know it's the start of hurricane season and we already have our first name storm out in the Atlantic. Yeah, Andrea popped up was a really small brief system out in the middle of the Atlantic, but it counted because it had winds that were over 30. You know 9 mph and we did see it spinning out here, but all the thunderstorms are gone. It's just a reminder that hurricane season is here and as we start heading towards July and August, the busier months will get more storms, but Barry will be the next name storm. We were done with our a name storm. Andrea falling apart tonight.  Glad it's Barry and not Bill. OK, Bill, well, thank you for that one. We'll check back with you a little later. In Washington today, the head of the NTSB saying failures on the part of Boeing and the FAA led to that door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines flight last year, adding it was a miracle no one died. But now there are questions over whether enough is being done to make sure this never happens again. Here's NBC's Tom Costello with more.

When Top Story returns tonight, an update on the Texas teen accused of fatally stabbing another teen at a track meet, now formerly indicted for murder.

Wait till you meet this parrot.  We are back now with power and politics as voters in the country's largest city line up at the polls today to take part in New York City's mayoral primary election, a race that could have national implications as Democrats try to take on President Trump. Here's a look at the Democratic candidates running in this race, political veteran and former governor of New York, of course, Andrew Cuomo, leading the pack, but two other progressive underdogs, Zorham Mamdani and Brad Lander, gaining some serious momentum in these final weeks, notably not on this list,  current mayor Eric Adams, who is running for re-election as an independent after federal corruption charges were dropped. For more on this contentious race, I'm joined now by NBC's Vaughn Hilliard, a good friend of ours, who has been out there at the polls all day, and Jeff Colton from Politico's New York City Playbook, who's been following this race closely for months. Thank you both for being here. So, Vaughn, I want to start with you. You were out talking to voters today. You even talked to Andrew Cuomo. What did you hear?  This is, in a lot of ways, a race that is more than about New York City, but it's very reflective of the Democratic Party. And I asked Andrew Cuomo very specifically, right, three-term governor. His dad served three terms as governor. Everybody knows that Cuomo's in New York. They said, why do you want to return to power? You're 67 years old. The other guy is half your age, Zoran Mdani.  And he said that we need experience to leave a city like this. He says Donald Trump is going to target, like he did LA, New York next. And you need somebody who has shown he can stand up to Donald Trump and is ready to do that again. And I want to perhaps listen to a little bit of that sound here, because I think there's quite a contrast between the two candidates in terms of what they're offering. Take a listen. I trust his experience level."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 25, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1298.933, "text": " He's never had a real job.

Because that's what I've heard, a hunger to actually have a vision for what these five boroughs could be, not just a fear of what it is today.  Look, Mamdani is endorsed by AOC and Bernie Sanders on the other side. You have Cuomo endorsed by Bill Clinton and Michael Bloomberg. I talked to one voter and I said, who did you select as your first choice? And she said, Cuomo. And I said, so you trust him? And she goes, no. She goes, but he's done this before. But before you go, we saw you there in the interviews. Everyone's sweating. It was hot today. Do you think that had any impact on turnout? 100 degrees. I saw one man actually.  difficult, but he went down on his knees because of the heat there. But I was talking to some poll workers that said they had several older folks that came out there, and they were determined to vote here. So we saw a steady stream. Yeah. I'm going to ask our great director, Brett Holey, to put up that full screen of all the candidates running. And Jeff, I want to show this to our viewers, because there's a lot of people running. It can fracture the vote. There was a guy named Bill de Blasio that sort of emerged out of nowhere, I remember, in a race just like this, a primary race. Andrew Cuomo doesn't have this locked up, right?  He does not. For the past five months, he led every single poll. He was the heavy favorite. He had 99% name recognition, whereas Zeran Mamdani, he had something like one out of every three voters knew who he was. But he just kept on climbing, climbing, climbing. Now everybody knows him, and this is basically a toss-up. I mean, we do not know what's going to happen tonight. Jeff, you get to play civics professor tonight, OK? So explain the rank voting, that rank choice voting that happens here in New York City.  That's right. So Democratic voters can pick up to five candidates, rank them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Tonight, we're going to know everybody's first choice. But next week, we're going to find out who was ranked 2, 3, 4, 5. They're going to redistribute the votes. They get rid of the candidates that don't have many votes. And the lower rankings get redistributed up to the leading candidates. It's a way to basically, instead of just having you vote with, you know,  It's a way to let you vote with your heart, kind of, you know, vote for who you actually want. People say it's a better style, and it will definitely affect the race tonight. This is a great graphic. Let's leave it up here so viewers can understand this. And Jeff, I want to ask you, who does this help, then, in this race, do you think? In this case, it helps Zoran Mamdani. He has done a real ranked strategy. Him and Brad Lander, the number three candidate in the polls, have been campaigning together constantly. Folks like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, they've been saying, rank these candidates, do not rank Cuomo.  And Andrew Cuomo, he's basically just been running a solo campaign, only himself. Today, he voted. We asked him, who did you rank? He said, only me, one person. If you're a Republican strategist and you're watching this and you're working with Donald Trump, you might be a little happy. And let me explain why. If Andrew Cuomo wins, right?  Vaughn, you're going to have a candidate who wins that goes in the face of the MeToo movement, that goes in the face of those prosecutions of Donald Trump in the civil lawsuits. What does that say about Democrats and the Democratic Party? Do they really care about those things? And also kind of like in 2020, right? People ended up going for Joe Biden.  and the more centrist candidate, older generation. And in this case, you could very well have that happen again. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, they're making the case that thousands, tens of thousands of people are coming out for their rallies across the country to take on Donald Trump. But ultimately, when it comes down to the ballot box, are they for that type of Democratic Party, the Democratic Socialist, sort of new generation, or are they continuing? Is the Democratic Party, that electorate, still behind your more centrist, older generation?  Jeff, we've got 30 seconds. If Mamdani wins, what message is that sent? Well, yeah, Mamdani is 33 years old. I mean, he, as AOC said at one of those rallies, this is the gerontocracy of the Democratic Party against new energy, that sort of thing. So this is a rejection of the establishment, which we've seen in many elections across the country, across the world, and it's an embrace of a younger, untested, democratic, socialist, leftist candidate.  We really ran out of time, but I have one more question. If Adams does run against whoever wins here, is the winner of the Democratic primary, you think, the next mayor of New York City, or does Adams have a chance? There's still a shot. We are going to have a competitive November, I think. All right. Jeff Fon, so great to have you guys both here. Appreciate it.

All right, Gabe Gutierrez for us. Gabe, we thank you. Now to some exclusive NBC News reporting concerning the FBI. The agency is reassigning some agents, pulling them off immigration cases, and focusing them on issues of national security in case of a potential threat from Iran.  This is according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter. But here's the situation. Some of them were already reassigned before that. For more on what all this means, I'm joined now by NBC News Justice Correspondent Ken Delaney. Ken, explain to us the back and forth here and why this is sort of a problem for the FBI.  So, Tom, under the Trump administration, there's been a massive redeployment of FBI resources towards immigration cases, which is not typically an FBI priority. But FBI agents have been tasked with accompanying ICE agents on raids, trying to track down undocumented immigrants. And many of them have been complaining, including to me, that they feel like this was taking their eye off the ball of some very important threats. After all, after 9-11, the FBI's top priority has been to stop terrorist attacks in the United States.  Well, over the weekend, a memo went out from the director of counterterrorism at the FBI to field offices saying, we're going to pull some of these people back and put them on Iran-related counterterrorism, counterespionage and cyber threats, because the belief is that, in the wake of this U.S. attack on Iran, the country is at greater risk from Iranian proxies, Iranian-sponsored terror threats.  What some of my FBI sources would say is the country was already at risk from ISIS-related terror threats and domestic terrorism, and only now is the Trump administration sort of reorienting these resources. Better late than never, they would say. The Trump administration, the FBI said in a statement to us that the FBI is continually reassessing the threat picture and realigning resources as needed, Tom.  All right, Ken, and I do want to also ask you here, since we have you on the show, the other headline regarding the Trump administration's mass deportations of Venezuelans to El Salvador in March. A whistleblower says a top DOJ official suggested ignoring court orders on deportations, alleging that, email Beau, that Trump's former personal lawyer said the DOJ would need to consider telling the courts to F you. So, Ken, talk to us about these claims and what we know about the players involved here.  Yes. So, the whistleblower is Erez Ruvini. He was a longtime DOJ prosecutor who was fired after he told a judge that, remember, Armando Abrego-Garcia, the man who was taken to that prison in El Salvador, now brought back in charge. This prosecutor told the judge that this man was improperly deported, which was factual, but got him crosswise with the Trump administration. So, he was fired. Now he's written a whistleblower complaint to the inspector general and went to lawmakers, alleging that, behind closed doors, the number three official at the Justice Department  Amyl Bovey mused about potentially violating court orders in the context of taking these immigrants to El Salvador, because, remember, judges were trying to stop that. And one federal judge has already said that there's probable cause to believe the Trump administration violated his orders.  Now, the Trump administration, the Justice Department, in fact, is disputing this. Todd Blanch, the deputy attorney general, says he was in those meetings, and no one suggested violating court orders. Tomorrow, there's a hearing, because Emil Bove has been nominated to be an appeals court judge. So he will be under oath, and he will be asked about this matter, Tom.  could be quite the moment. All right, Ken Delaney, first. Ken, love having you on the show. Next tonight to top stories, health check, and a major warning tonight when it comes to ticks this summer. Researchers at Fordham University setting the tick risk at 10 out of 10 in the New York region, meaning people should use extreme caution when outside.  The scale advising people who are thinking of going on a hike outside to go to the movies instead. Health officials bracing for an increase in tick-borne infections, including more cases of Lyme disease. A trend the CDC has been tracking. Cases have been more concentrated in the Northeast since the tracking began in the 1990s. You can see how they increased almost a decade later in 2010. And then in 2023, the most amount of people impacted by the disease, most cases spread by a tick bite.  For more on what you can do to protect yourself from the growing tick population, I want to bring in Dr. Eric Ascher.

Thanks for coming on the show tonight. Up next here on Top Story, the new warning in Europe, the deadly virus that's sickening thousands of people at a popular tourist destination. And Cobra Kai confrontation, a Karate Kid actor accused of biting and then kissing his co-star's arm. What? This all happened at a fan convention. Tonight, her reaction, his apology, and the moments police responded to the scene. Stay with us.  We're back now with Top Stories Global Watch. We start with European health officials issuing a warning to travelers about an increase in hepatitis A infections. They say it's happening in four popular destinations, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia. Nine people have died so far. More than 2,000 others have gotten sick. Hepatitis A spreads primarily through contaminated food and water, most commonly when an infected person doesn't wash their hands after using the restroom.  OK, a man was rescued from the cab of a truck that was hanging over a collapsed bridge in China. Look at this. You can see him there talking to the person who shot this video. A statement from the local Department of Transportation saying the collapse was due to a landslide. Three other cars were found at the bottom under the bridge, but no people were found. This collapse is under investigation.  and once one of London's best-kept secrets, set to become one of its most highly anticipated attractions. Here's what we mean. A series of underground tunnels dating back to World War II will transform into an intelligence museum, interactive World War II memorial, and one of the world's deepest underground bars. Literally. Dug in the 1940s, the tunnels were made in secret out of fear of a Nazi invasion, and later acted as a government communications center. The London tunnels are planned to open in 2028.  And staying overseas in Venice, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos and fiancee Lauren Sanchez are throwing one of the most lavish and highly anticipated weddings of the year, maybe of the century. The guest list and itinerary under wraps, but some notable guests like Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner have already been spotted arriving in the floating city. Not everyone is happy about the upcoming events with activists and some locals organizing protests. Here's NBC's Molly Hunter.  It's one of the most romantic cities in the world.

The city is in contact with the organization of events, and we are trying to have all the information in advance to deal with them.

Where is President Putin? I ask that question in light of what's been happening over the past week in Iran. Where's Russia?  Where's President Putin? You couldn't find either one of them with a search party. Dog the bounty hunter all of a sudden couldn't find President Putin. All of a sudden even Google can't find Russia. I thought Iran and Russia were peeps. I thought they were best friends.  I mean, for decades, Iran and Russia have had a partnership where they have attacked everyone in the freedom-loving West. They're best buds. Now, I know Iran has a relationship with China, but that's more transactional. China just likes to buy Iran's cheap oil.  With Russia and Iran, it was supposed to be a deeper, more meaningful relationship. And this isn't something new. This has been a partnership for decades. I remember when Putin invaded Ukraine. One of the first allies he turned to was Iran.  And Iran sent Russia ammunition. And Iran sent Russia artillery shells. And Iran sent Russia drones. And Iran has sent Russia drones and ammunition and artillery shells every single day of the war. So where's Russia? I mean, it hadn't been a good week for Iran.  Where's Russia? On Monday of this week, Iran's top diplomat met with President Putin and asked for help. You know what President Putin said he would provide? Nothing. Zero.  zilch, not I. Some kind of friend. And you know, it's not the first time that we've seen President Putin's true colors. It's happened before. You would think that Iran would learn. The month after Iran  through Hamas attacked Israel back in October of 2023. Iran immediately asked Moscow to supply Iran with, because Iran knew what was coming and so did Hamas. They knew retribution was coming from Israel.  Ron asked Moscow for jet fighters, for attack helicopters, air defense systems, and training jets. And Ron was sure that their buddy, Putin, would be there. Putin sent them a few jets and said, go away, don't bother me. And then, not long ago,  When Israel took out the better part of Iran's air defense system, its Golden Dome, wasn't exactly golden, it was more like tin, but the Israelis took it out. Iran asked Russia, said, look, we have to rearm. We're naked and alone here.  We need more air defense missiles to shoot down the Israeli planes. President Putin said, go away. Don't bother me. What a friend. President Putin has done it to other countries. Russia has had alliances not just with Iran through the years. I'll give you a couple of examples.  Armenia. Armenia and Russia were best buds. Two peas in a pod. But when Armenia got in a war with Azerbaijan, let me say that again, Azerbaijan, once again, you couldn't find Russia with a search party.  Iran and Russia worked together to prop up al-Assad in Syria. Remember that? When the people of Syria were revolting against Assad, who had blood under his fingernails, you know who kept him afloat? Iran, yes, but especially Russia. And then Assad got in trouble.  And that's when he really needed Russia. And he went to Mr. Putin and said, help me, help me. And Mr. Putin said, no, you're on your own. You can come to my country where they can't get to you, but that's it. Too bad. I don't need you anymore. I hope a lot's going on with respect to the Middle East right now.  But I hope the world notices what kind of friend Russia is. I hope other countries that Russia has alliances with, and that Russia is assiduously courting to be a, quote, partnership, notices how Russia reacts to their friends. Where's Russia? Where's Putin?  all of a sudden you can't find him. Now, I'm delighted with that. I'm just delighted. But this was very, very predictable. With friends like Russia, I say this to every country in the world that might be thinking about partnering with Russia, with friends like Russia, who needs enemies."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

Not only did the president work with our allies in the region, of course, working very closely with Israel, but the president defended America, again, let's not forget the Ayatollah  and many others in his leadership structure have been chanting death to America for years as they tried to get a nuclear weapon. Under previous presidents who let this build and build for decades, and the world knew one day it had to be confronted. But the president didn't just take that strong and decisive action. Under the War Powers Resolution, in compliance with that law, he notified Congress within 48 hours of the actions that were taken.  And hopefully that's as far as it's going to go. The president announced yesterday that there is now a ceasefire. Again, peace through strength, they're not just words. They have to be actions that a president of the United States who's strong and bold and decisive is willing to take those steps to keep America safe. And I think most people in the civilized world know that a nuclear-armed Iran is not just bad for America, but it's bad for other countries all around the world.  Now, we've got another busy week here in Washington. Today, we're going to be debating the resolution to condemn the political violence in Minnesota. I think you'll see a very strong bipartisan message being sent by Congress that political violence is never acceptable. And you see the actions over the weekend  with the state representative and our husband who were brutally murdered, the senator who was nearly killed. We keep all of them in our prayers and their families. But we know that justice will prevail. And ultimately, in America, we need to be united when we say that political violence is never the answer.  We're going to also bring more legislation to protect Americans from illegals who come here and commit violence against our constituents. Somebody gets a DUI here while they're here illegally. And I saw this in my own district.  where you had an illegal who came about eight times the legal limit and murdered an 18-year-old girl and her boyfriend. And he was fine, but they are no longer with us. And we see this every day in communities all across the country. We've given President Trump some tools in law, like the Lake and Riley Act,  to keep us safe from people who come here illegally and commit violent acts against our citizens. This will be one more of those tools. Of course, Friday, we're going to have a vote to stand up for our ICE agents and for law enforcement in Los Angeles and other communities who are trying to keep us safe in the face of these violent riots, like the L.A. riots that you're seeing. That will be Friday. Of course,  The overarching focus has been on the one big, beautiful bill. The Senate finally has the legislation. They're moving forward. We've continued up here to talk about so many great things that this will do to get our economy back on track, to put more money in the pockets of hardworking families through so many provisions, like certainty in the tax code, ensuring that you don't have a massive tax increase that would hit lower and middle income families. No tax on tips. No tax on overtime.  the ability to have bonus depreciation, some of the other things that would bring investment into this country. But we also have so many other provisions. Border security, of course, is one. But energy security is a big component of this bill to allow America to continue producing more oil so we don't have to be dependent on foreign countries. So world markets aren't worried about an action Iran might take. When you saw them talking about shutting off the Strait of Hormuz,  You really didn't see much of a change in oil prices because America and our allies can now pick up the slack because you have a president, Donald Trump, who wants to open up more American energy opportunities. And so do our friends around the world. And in this bill, we have a number of provisions to do that. But rather than me talk about those provisions,  And I love the great work that South Louisiana is involved in in so many different fronts at producing energy for the rest of the country in the world.

A lot of these wars are not going to be fought with just tanks and guns. They're going to be fought when it comes to cyberspace, when it comes to AI, and when it comes to infiltrating other countries. The way we have to do this is have our top technology experts be ready for Iran attacks. I think this is going to continue.

Megan.  Hey, guys. Good morning. So this is a news conference that will wrap up a very quick trip by the president to the Netherlands, spending less than 24 hours there for the NATO summit. But we do expect him any moment. He's had a series of pull-asides this morning with the head of NATO, the leader of the Netherlands. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was meant to be on his bilateral schedule as well. So watching for all of that, and then just a few pieces of news to watch for from this press conference, the main one being that, of course, this is happening against the backdrop of everything going on  in Israel and Iran. There continue to be a lot of questions about the level of destruction of Iran's nuclear sites following those US strikes on Saturday. So expect that to be a main topic of conversation here and of reporter questions as well. The other thing just to flag is that a NATO summit declaration has been signed. And you mentioned this earlier, but NATO members have agreed to up their spending on defense to 5% of GDP by 2035, giving them 10 years to do that. But I'll give you some context here. That is a very high level.  The U.S., according to the Defense Department, is at a record low at this point, last year spending less than 3% of GDP on defense spending. So it's a high level for these European countries, but that's been a main theme this week. The only other thing I would flag that could come up in this news conference is in this declaration.  It's the first NATO summit declaration since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war that does not directly condemn Russia's aggression towards Ukraine. There had been questions ahead of time about whether the U.S. would sign on to a declaration that included that language. Now we know it's not in there.

An investment platform is launching new digital tokens that use blockchain technology to mirror the performance of the private shares of SpaceX. That's according to a Wall Street Journal report that says the platform, called Republic, is using the strategy to give investors access to companies typically reserved for the wealthy. The method hasn't been tested with regulators yet.  And chip design firm Ambarella coming off more than 20 percent stock gain yesterday. A report says that the company is working with bankers on a potential sale. Also, speaking of chips, Micron Technologies quarterly results are due after today's closing bell.

Well, we have just heard now from Court 7 here at the Old Bailey that 37-year-old Marcus Monzo...  has been found guilty of the murder of schoolboy Daniel Angerin on the 30th of April last year. He carried out a drug-fuelled, frenzied attack on multiple people, but including taking the lives of little Daniel, who was 14 years old and was walking to school.  This was a decision that the jury had been pondering over since Friday afternoon and they have now, in the last few moments, come to their decision and those verdicts stand, additionally, on being found guilty of attempted murder of four other people and wounding with intent  a police officer. Let's unfold the events that happened on the 30th of April last year. 37-year-old Monzo had woken up in north-east London and started to take a lot of cannabis. He had been smoking cannabis that morning. Before leaving that day, before 6am,  He had skinned, killed and deboned his cat before leaving his home to unleash the most brutal campaign of violence. I want to remind viewers that the case itself that we're about to discuss is incredibly distressing. Some of the details are distressing.  After doing so to his pet cat, who he called Wizard, he left his home driving his grey van. He proceeded to knock over a pedestrian, taking out of his van a couple of swords. We knew from learning throughout this court case that Monzo was fascinated with martial arts. He was a martial arts enthusiast described by the prosecution. In going about this rampage, after injuring this member of the public,  He then proceeded to follow Daniel Andrew, the 14-year-old, as I mentioned, walking to school. He was on his way to start his day in school when Monzo ran up behind him and attacked him so ferociously that the prosecution said he almost decapitated the young boy with a sword that was some 60 centimetres  in length. Police arrived, they tried to get the incident under control. Monzo refused to let them access Daniel, who had been on the ground by this point, witnessing the attack, were neighbours. The jury were shown multiple streams of CCTV footage, body-worn camera footage, that showed the extent of the chaos that unfolded. After running away from officers, Monzo proceeded to enter a couple's house. He then proceeded to attack the couple that was still in bed with their young baby next door.  He then proceeded to escaping that house. As police tried to corner him, he attacked another two officers. He described the attack afterwards, Monzo, to police as being like in a Hollywood film, The Hunger Games. He described the fact that he felt after taking and smoking this cannabis that he was experiencing a psychotic episode.  almost schizophrenic in nature, which gave him an alternative personality. He said his alternative personality made him feel as though he was a professional assassin. The defence throughout this entire case have been arguing that Monzo should be fighting for diminished responsibility, that the cannabis had such an effect on his brain that he wasn't able to comprehend what he was doing.  He remembered the events that led up to the attack, but didn't remember anything that unfolded over the course of just 20 minutes. And jurors were told about this cannabis that he had taken, the schizophrenic-like symptoms that he'd been experiencing. And whilst the defence tried to use this argument of diminished responsibility, the prosecution in this case argued that it did not matter. Prosecution did not apply, because he was in this psychotic state because of the cannabis that he himself had decided to take.  But as I say, at the centre of all of this is a 14-year-old schoolboy who lost his life, and also the trauma that this has left for numerous other people. But on the 30th of April last year, we now have that verdict, and I just want to read them all out to you. Marcus Monzo, 37 years old, from the Hainalt area of north-east London, has been found guilty of the murder of Daniel Andrewin. He's been found guilty of the attempted murder of Donato,  who was that pedestrian he knocked over, Cindy Arias, Henry de Los Rios, the couple who had been inside that bedroom, which he burst into, and PC Yasmin Margaret Metcham-Whitfield, who we understood from the prosecution very nearly died in this incident. He has also been found guilty, Monzo, of wounding with intent, Inspector Molloy Campbell also found guilty of aggravated burglary and possessing a bladed article."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

And I just wondered, this is an official letter, and they're very serious people, as you know. The devastating U.S. strike on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility totally inoperable. It was devastated.  We assess that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities has set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons for many years to come. This achievement can continue indefinitely if Iran does not get access to nuclear material, which it won't.  It's so, so sad that that whole thing had to go. But I just, I just want to thank our pilots. You know, they were maligned and treated very bad, demeaned by fake news CNN, which is back there, believe it or not, wasting time, wasting, and nobody's watching them. So they're just wasting a lot of time, wasting my time. And the New York Times, they put out a story that, well, maybe they were hit, but it wasn't bad. Well, it was so bad that they ended the war. It ended the war.  Somebody said in a certain way, you know, that it was so devastating, actually. If you look at Hiroshima, if you look at Nagasaki, you know, that ended a war, too. This ended a war in a different way, but it was so devastating. Also, they have \u2014 out of Dubai, just came that Iran's foreign ministry spokesman \u2014 this is Iran's foreign ministry \u2014 says it's near. Its nuclear installations were very badly damaged by  the American strike. So what bothered me about these reports were fake reports put out by the New York Times. I call it the failing New York Times because it's doing terribly. Without me, it would be doing no business at all. And by fake news, CNN, and MSDNC, all of these terrible people. They have no credibility.  You know, when I started, they were at 94 percent credibility. The media now it's at 16 percent. And I'm very proud of it because I've exposed it for what it is. But when I.  When I saw them starting to question the caliber of the attack, was it bad? Well, it was really bad. It was devastating. They obliterated. In fact, you can't get into the tunnels. They just put that over. That just came out. They can't. There's nothing. There's no way you can even get down. The whole thing is collapsed in a disaster. And I think all of the nuclear stuff is down there because it's very hard to remove.  And we did it very quickly. When they heard we were coming, it was, you know, you can't move it. Very hard, very dangerous, actually, to move to. And they also knew we were coming, so I don't think too many people want to be down there knowing we're coming with the bunker busters, as we call them. We're the only ones that have them. We have the best equipment, best nuclear equipment, and we have the best equipment in the world. And by the way, we can't forget our submarine, which was out there. Submarines, actually. But submarine was out there. We shot.  30 rockets into an area, every single one of them. I think it was almost 400 miles away, I think, Pete, right? 400? And long. It was in the ocean, long ways away.  And we shot a total of 30. Every single one of them hit within nine inches from where it was supposed to be. It took out a lot. Because we didn't do just Forto. We did two others in addition, which hadn't been completely destroyed. So we hit them with a submarine from hundreds of miles away. Amazing, just amazing equipment.  greatest submarines in the world. Nobody's even close at 20 years behind us when it comes to submarine technology. So that's one and the other was.  was from the Atomic Energy Commission. And they have about three or four of them now coming in from Atomic Energy Commissions from various places. But the one that we have that just came out, we released it a little while ago, was from the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. But numerous of them are getting to see the site, and the site has been demolished. And again, we had these brave patriots, these incredible flyers, these people that  can fly a plane better than anybody can fly a plane, going into very hostile territory, flying into the territory that has got more missiles and things pointed at it. But it was very stealth. They didn't get to see it. It was dark. That's the amazing thing about the shots. They hit the shots perfectly. And yet it was dead dark. There was no moon. There was no light. It was virtually moonless.  It was very dark and they hit the shots were hit perfectly. But when they get demeaned and they were very upset about it because they knew how strong it would be back in Missouri. The pilots flew about 36 hours two ways far distance and in those incredible B2s. And we then had the F-22s and we had the F-35s and we had other planes and we had I think a total of 52 tankers. That means the big the big tankers because the refueling was a lot for all of the different planes that we sent.  incredible operation. And I have to say, General Raising Cain was incredible. That's why he beat ISIS. And we beat ISIS in a matter of weeks. I was told it would take four to five years. We did it in a few weeks. And he was great. That's why he's the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff right now, because I had a very good experience with him. He knocked out ISIS in a period of literally a few weeks. Amazing. And it was supposed to take a few years, five years to be exact.  So we had a great victory there, and we then came here, and I think we had a great victory here. But this is an ongoing project. This is the safety of Europe, the safety of the world.  And they've raised it from 2% to 5%, something which nobody... And you're talking about over a trillion dollars a year. So we're talking about a lot of money from... coming in from countries that we're not paying nearly enough to be effective. So, uh, I have, as you know, Marco Rubio with me and Pete Hegseth, secretary.  of State and Secretary of War. Should we say Secretary? You know, it used to be called Secretary of War. Maybe for a couple of weeks we'll call it that, because we feel like warriors. It used to be called Secretary of War. In fact, if you look at the old building next to the White House, you can see where it used to be Secretary of War. Then we became politically correct, and they called it Secretary of Defense. I don't know. Maybe we'll have to start thinking about changing it.

I've been in contact with the Israelis, who are really the people on the ground taking a look at this. And they believe, based on their preliminary assessment, because it's the people on the ground that are going to make the most in-depth assessment of what is taking place here. And they haven't completed their assessment. And they believe the program is set back at least two years, if not longer,  based on what took place at those sites. And obviously, they hit all 12 sites before we hit the major underground facilities here. And look at the DIA report. It was a preliminary report that had never reached the president yet. It has to go through a process with all the intelligence agencies coming together, making an assessment, and then bring that conclusion to the president.  That has been truncated by the leak. So that process hasn't even been completed. And certainly the people are reporting on it in the New York Times and CNN are trying to take advantage of it. I think this will simmer down at some point as the evidence is overwhelming in terms of the success of this operation. But let me say a couple of more points on this. The ceasefire, I would have liked to have seen it have some conditions.  public conditions as well as private conditions, and that is, is that you are not going to rebuild your program, and if you do, Israel and the United States may have to stop it, and we will. I think that's implied, and the president certainly made statements to that effect here, so it cleared up any doubt of what we're dealing with. Let's face reality here. The regime that's in power in Iran has not changed.  They're going to still want a nuclear weapon because they believe it protects them in terms of their survival. They will try to find a way to rebuild it. That's kind of who they are. They are steadfast in their resistance to the United States and Israel.  And the United States certainly is committed to Israel here to make certain this doesn't happen. As Martha said, I mean, Iran is back on its heels in a way that they have never been in 45 years. They have lost their military capability. They've lost their nuclear program, much of their ballistic missile program, much of their leadership.  And I think they've been politically weakened inside of their country, which makes them more vulnerable to maybe through violence and a coup, changing the regime, or eventually the people themselves having a say about changing the regime. But nonetheless, I don't want to focus too much on regime change, but they're vulnerable to it in a way they haven't been. Then a second major point he made.  is deterrence. The United States, in focusing on destroying the end state of Iran's nuclear program, with such a major, remarkable operation that was conducted here, our adversaries are looking at this. And they see the message. And that's United States global leadership returning to the world stage and their willingness to confront adversaries. The other thing that makes this  so important and critical is look at the proxies. None of them came to help Iran in a moment of desperation, particularly Hezbollah, who was organized with billions of dollars, 150,000 rockets and missiles, to do principally one thing.  defend Iran against Israel. They never fired a shot. Where is Russia and China in helping their partner, their partner in the Axis alliance? No help whatsoever, except rhetoric. Iran is isolated here, and we have achieved the measure of deterrence. Both of those adversary countries need to know, and they got the message from President Trump.  We are willing to confront your aggression and your ambitions when they're stepping on U.S. national interest. And that is a hugely powerful message that is coming out of what we're saying here."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

If there's no consequences, then border enforcement is less. This is what the American people need to know. I think they understand. That's why President Trump's in the White House.

My name is Josh Breslow and I've been here for the past several hours to bring you all of your top stories and breaking news. I do want to get you to a statement that is just coming into our newsroom. Take a look. We are hearing from Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, and she's released a statement.  pertaining to the U.S. strikes on Iran and Iran's nuclear program. Gabbard posting this on X. Take a look. New intelligence confirms what President Trump has stated numerous times. Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed. If the Iranians choose to rebuild, they would have to rebuild all three facilities entirely, which would likely take years to do.  The propaganda media has deployed their usual tactic, selectively release portions of illegally leaked classified intelligence assessments, intentionally leaving out the fact that the assessment was written with, quote, low confidence to try to undermine President Trump's decisive leadership.  and the brave servicemen and women who flawlessly executed a truly historic mission to keep the American people safe and secure. Again, that statement here just coming in from Tulsi Gabbard, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence.  Now we know that President Trump has disputed that U.S. intelligence report suggesting that Iran's nuclear program had been set back only a few months after those American strikes on the facility days ago. He called it, quote, fake news.  The report issued by the Defense Intelligence Agency contradicts those statements from Trump and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the status of Iran's nuclear facilities. And that report states the strikes did significant damage, but again, only set back the program by a few months.  President Trump says Iran's nuclear program has been obliterated, and the leaked report is only meant to attack him at the expense of the pilots who performed the mission. The Pentagon did confirm Sunday that seven American B-2 bombers from Missouri were used, and they were armed with 14 bunker buster bombs, the first  operational use of that weapon. And we do have some of the aircraft used right here. The video coming into our newsroom as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the strikes, quote, an incredible and overwhelming success.

And so he, the young man, Danny, represents a new look, a fresh look for a lot of younger voters. Now, again, voter turnout being what it is, if Eric Adams, the American, run an independent campaign, I don't know what Cuomo's gonna do. I suspect he'll drop out, but maybe not.

And so a lot of these simple solutions like just freeze all rents in the city, just give away this, give away that, is very reminiscent of what we have seen in some other large, big cities that are blue Democrat cities. And frankly, it hasn't worked.  You know, the idea that you can do away with the police doesn't work. It invites crime. And eventually it rebounds against the person in office.

He had a lot of people who didn't typically vote who said, I want that guy in the White House and went out and voted for him so we could see the same sort of effect in New York City.  The age piece of it, to be honest, doesn't bother me a whole lot. It's not about age. It's about philosophy. It's about, you know, what's your plan for New York City, this amazingly complex, beautiful place, really, in many, many respects.  beset with all kinds of issues like all big cities in America.

We're not going to bring you on camera just yet, because we have these live pictures. This is perfect timing. Trump is back in DC. Let's, I think, first get to the NATO summit in general. NATO leaders today agreed on a massive hike in defense spending to 5% of GDP after pressure  from President Trump, they expressed their, quote, ironclad commitment to come to each other's aid if attacked.

Now, I do think one of the interesting aspects to these developments is that the United States will not be joining onto that 5%  commitment to spending on defense relating to Europe and other NATO members. But again, he's talking about the conflicts that obviously the United States is currently involved in, in the Middle East and potential tension brewing in the South Pacific pursuant to China. So on the one hand, you've got the European leaders giving Donald Trump something that he wants in hopes that perhaps he scratches their backs  in regard to Ukraine.

And he essentially said he is now considering sending more Patriot missile systems to Ukraine. This has been something that Zelensky has  asked of President Trump since he entered office back in January, but the American president has been hesitant to provide because he wants to see this war wind down. But again, because of this ongoing aggression by Russia and the failure of President Putin to substantively come to the negotiating table on a ceasefire, I think you're seeing President Trump shift in his position. There was an extraordinary moment where a Ukrainian reporter  who is currently living in Warsaw with her children, asked the president a question on this topic. And he took a minute and, you know, asked her about her story, asked about her husband, who is still back in Ukraine and is fighting for the defense of their homeland.

But I think it's important to note here that the truth is somewhere in the gray area. President Trump is arguing that  The nuclear facilities have been completely obliterated. Certain satellite imagery and intelligence from the U.S., Israel, and our Five Eyes allies have corroborated part of that, but there's just no way to know if the entire underground facility at Fordow  is obliterated until international inspectors go in there. And I do think it's interesting, again, the White House isn't disputing that this report was put out by the Pentagon, at least internally, but it is a win in that they get to put this thing back on the press. They're saying that CNN, New York Times, again, the fake news as the president puts it, they are denigrating these quote unquote patriots  who flew this B-2 bombing mission, and they're arguing that they're trying to weaken the president's position.

And we also heard from Tulsi Gabbard today, the director of national intelligence.  I'm indicating there is new, more intelligence on these strikes here. She said this, I'm going to read it in full, it's kind of long. She says, new intelligence confirms what POTUS has stated numerous times. Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed. If the Iranians chose to rebuild, they would have to rebuild all three facilities, Natanz, Fordow, Esfahan entirely.  which would likely take years to do. The propaganda media has deployed their usual tactic, selectively released portions of illegally classified intelligence assessments, intentionally leaving out the fact that the assessment was written with low confidence to try to undermine President Trump's decisive leadership and the brave servicemen and women who flawlessly executed a truly historic mission to keep the American people safe and secure.  of Iran.  facilities. And in Axios today, Christian, you alluded to this, that the Trump administration is planning to limit sharing classified information with Congress after someone leaked an internal assessment suggesting the bombings of the facilities were not as successful as President Trump claimed. So when I asked you about the White House going on the offensive, it seems like they're putting out all the stops that  to disabuse the press and the public of this notion that the Bunker Buster bombs had little to no effect, or we just can't know entirely for sure right this very moment."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 631.061, "text": " Without a doubt, but I want to go back to D.N.I. Gabbard's statement for a second. She talks about new evidence, but what's not in that statement that she puts out? What this new evidence actually is. And I understand that, you know, classification law is playing a part here, but I just want to point to what Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in the Netherlands earlier. He talked about how they had confirmed that this bombing run had taken out a conversion facility.  That is a specific detail that we aren't hearing from some of these other administration officials. Look, ultimately, I think we're arguing semantics, right? We have 100% concrete proof that those B-2 massive ordnance bombs hit those three nuclear facilities. They have set back those programs for an undetermined amount of time, and we won't know exactly how long that window is, again, until international inspectors get in there.  And so I think the president trying to say that the media is wholesale fabricating these reports is just not correct. Again, I think if you want to take a look in the mirror, if you're President Trump, he's thinking about his legacy. He has not been able to bring Iran to a new nuclear deal. He had hoped that Tehran  might be more willing to negotiate after these strikes took place. And now he's saying as he's departing the NATO summit, I don't care if we get a deal with Iran. Their facilities are destroyed and they do not have the capacity to acquire a nuclear weapon. He's trying to spin this into as big of a win as possible.

And I've been stipulating that in our reporting. This DIA analysis was  low confidence. It was a low confidence assessment. And it was just one agency out of 18 intelligence agencies in kind of the national security apparatus of the United States. So that's all important here.

And again, you saw the president go after the Atlantic and Jeffrey Goldberg, slam them as fake news. And then eventually, once that story sort of died down a little bit, they moved on to the next scandal or the next crisis. That's just what this administration does. They see themselves in a hole, and in order to dig out of it, they'll go back  and run the same plays that work with their base. In this case, try and push back against the idea that the media is covering this administration objectively.

When he was referencing Trump's bombing of Iran and the ceasefire he claimed credit for between Iran and Israel. So the flattery seemed to be working.  Trump emerged from the meetings returning the compliments and very pleased with the fact that the NATO members agreed to raise their defense spending as he had wanted for several years. He said of Rutte that the daddy comment was affectionate. No, he likes me. I think he likes me. This NATO summit was pleasant and full of praise between Trump and the leaders of the NATO nations.  But it hasn't always been the case. Trump, during his very first NATO summit as president, during his first term, berated some of the nations for not paying their fair share for their own defense."}], "keywords": ["Trump"], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

Obviously, probably the most provocative of his ideas that's causing a lot of anxiety, even in the stock market. Like if you look at real estate, some of the rent freeze stuff, which for obvious, like economists hate that kind of thing. They think it's, you know, various forms of rent control is a terrible idea. We understand why investors in real estate don't like it either. On the other hand, and so we talked about that, but on the other hand, my main takeaway from that interview is like,  Yes, like if you're a young democratic socialist, of course, you're going to be really excited about the Mamdani candidacy. But he comes off in a way that if you're sort of like a, I would say like normie center left democratic liberal or something, and you're sort of the typical person who works in an office in New York City, like he is really good and really talented at not seeming like someone who will be a threat to you.  And I think that when you look at the results last night, that's like, to my mind, like the really striking part is that how broad that coalition was, et cetera, because we know that there are parts of the city that have trended that way for a while. Obviously, AOC's victory in 2022 or sorry, 2018. That was a stunner, but that was niche. You know, this was the entire city.  Right. This was this was kind of everyone across, you know, huge swaths, much bigger numbers. He did well in sort of the white educated areas, but also he did well in more non-white areas that had trended more towards Trump in the most recent election.  So he clearly did a really good job of sort of overcoming the fact that many people would say he has pretty radical politics. And well, actually, he can sort of like talk very fluently about policy.

They like went there for like the minimum amount of time they could to maybe change tax status. And a bunch of people came back. Yeah, I'm going to Miami now on the other. So it's like, if you're like, there aren't really going to be that many people like, oh, I'm upset about the mayor. I'm upset about taxes. I'm going to move. But  If the quality of life in the city degrades, if people perceive, oh, the public transit is not running as well, it's not as clean, there's more crime in the city, the schools aren't as good, then of course you're gonna have people leaving. So my gut would be, and again, maybe this is just my sort of pro-New York bias,  My gut is that very few people are going to leave because they're upset about the mayor, per se. This is where all the action is. If you want to talk to someone interesting... It's probably not the first mayor that people have been upset about, either. No, exactly. People are always upset about the... They're going to be upset about... So, like, I don't think that is... On the other hand, if he can't implement a vision of a... You know, he says it's going to make this city more affordable. People expect the quality of services to be good. People expect transit to be good.  If he can't deliver on that, then I would expect that, yeah, at the margins, more people leave because the city is less appealing.

And I think we have a general consensus on many of those building blocks in our society, whether it's public education or libraries or sanitation.

And that in an era of social media, et cetera, people can sort of sniff out a fraud or sniff out a phony or whatever. And he certainly doesn't come off as one.

But the kind of wink-wink that the company's giving in the statement is that they're continuing to invest in capacity. Jake will remember, because we talked about it a lot of the time, that we were trying to do the math when they upsized their commitment to investing in additional U.S. manufacturing capacity.  It is slow and it's expensive to do, but I'm looking for signs, and maybe Jake can jump in and tell me where I can find them, if they are what we would call supply constrained. In other words, is the demand out there greater than their ability to supply right now, and is that a limiting factor in high bandwidth memory? Because the rest of the marketplace for data centers would tell you that that is or is not the case. You know, NVIDIA would say that probably is still the case."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 257.249, "text": " Yeah, no, definitely.

But really, Micron and the industry are supply constrained, not just in high bandwidth memory, but also in the traditional DRAM and NAND businesses, less so NAND right now, in general.

We've been talking about the birdbath, of course, all week and some of the items that have already been knocked out of this legislation by the parliamentarian. But now it's time to get real in the Senate. We're looking at a vote that could come in the next couple of days. We just don't know. Remember, John Thune originally wanted to vote today. Then they thought maybe it would slide to Thursday. Then we said a Friday vote. That's the plan. Now we're hearing about a weekend voterama, maybe a Sunday vote. All of this could slide.  which is making some folks nervous when it comes to the timeline. You know the drill. If you listen to this program, President Trump wants it on his desk by the 4th of July, and it's something that he's talked about quite a bit.  unclear if that's going to happen, because then the House has to take pretty much whatever the Senate passes back to them next week, codify the Senate to the President. And not a lot of folks are assuming that that's going to happen. Now, of course, if this bill does not pass and everyone's got a problem with something inside of it, it's going to mean a big tax hike, the expiration of the Trump tax cuts from 2017.  Enter Jay Timmons, the man who runs the National Association of Manufacturers at the Treasury Department today, helping to push this along, but also out with new information from the association. What would it mean if this didn't pass? Say goodbye to one million manufacturing jobs.  According to the research, Jay Timmons is with us now, the president of the National Association. It's great to see you. Welcome back, as always, to Bloomberg. Good to see you, Joe. This is pretty tough stuff. And I'm going to pull it up in front of me here. It's not just the jobs. It's $540 billion in lost wages, over a trillion dollars in lost GDP. Are you getting nervous that this is starting to slide too far? You know I'm not. Yeah? I am an eternal optimist, so that helps.  Especially when you're in Washington these days. But look, I mean, the economic impact is so devastating if this doesn't get through. Members of Congress, frankly, of both parties acknowledge that, even though this will end up being a partisan bill and it will be a discussion among Republicans.  about what the final legislation looks like. But I'm really optimistic it's going to get done. And you had mentioned that the president wants to get it passed by Congress by July 4th. I think he actually wants to sign it by July 4th. That's not his desk, right? The fireworks are going to go off. Exactly. But I can see him choreographing the entire show.  Oh, absolutely. Do you care? You want to see this done by the end of the year before the tax cuts potentially expire, right? Oh, absolutely. So look, the good news is... Or does it need to happen by the 4th of July?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 189.406, "text": "No, it does."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 190.346, "text": "It does. And let me tell you why. First of all, let's talk about the good news. The good news is that the corporate rates that were instituted in 2017 remain intact. They're not  messed around with in the bill. So they're permanent already. But the real problem we have, and those numbers that you cited from our study that we did with EY, that is as a result of some provisions that have already expired. And the part that is really devastating, which is the pass-through deduction for small businesses, if that expires, their tax rate goes up enormously. What's already expired?  So, the R&D tax deduction, the interest deductibility, the expensing, and so we want to make it permanent. And the Senate side has done that. So that's why we really like the Senate bill. We love the House bill too. They did  Yeoman's work there. They've got literally all ten of our key priorities in that bill the Senate retained them and actually made them better There still a few issues that that we'd like to see resolved in the Senate bill Okay, but that permanency is really important, right? And and when you ask is it okay to get it done at the end of the year versus say now your members say no Well, here's why right? You're talking about multi-billion dollar hundreds of billions of dollars  in planning for investments here in the United States. You don't just do that with a flip of the light switch, right? So frankly, I'm worried that it's already too late to plan for 2026 and 2027. But hopefully, if we get it done now, they can make those plans for those investments. Interesting.  We talk about permanence with regard to business tax cuts. This has been a drive on the Senate side, to your point. It's about to come back to the House, where they want to have a $40,000 cap on SALT.  And this is where the push and pull starts to, I say they, a small group of lawmakers from states like New York and New Jersey, you know how delicate this whole balance is. If you make the tax cuts permanent, that gets to be a lot more difficult to pay for the SALT deduction. This is the debate that's happening right now. And if you could bring us in the room, what are you hearing from lawmakers when you talk about this? Yeah, so here's the interesting thing. If you look at the House and how they had to arrive at their final numbers,  They have one way that they're measuring revenue. The Senate has a different policy. This is the current baseline. We walk out hard on this show, so people will actually know what you're talking about. Well, so look, we like current policy, right?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 355.526, "text": "You do."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 355.966, "text": "You want the current policy baseline. The Senate side, the way they're scoring it. And that gives them a little bit more flexibility.  I don't know how much flexibility. I understand what members of Congress are pushing for when they represent states where they want a higher limit on the SALT deduction. For us, though, our number one priority, as you might guess, is we want to make sure that those business taxes are permanent so that, again, businesses can plan for the future.  We're all in on the president's call for growing more manufacturing here in the United States. That has been a consistent thread through every administration, Republican and Democrat, for as long as I've been in this job. But President Trump is probably a bigger champion than anybody I've ever seen of making sure that we grow domestic manufacturing.  But we can only do that if we have a comprehensive manufacturing strategy, which involves permanence on the tax front. Also involves modernized regulations. It involves a smart trade policy. It involves workforce development. And I would argue it also involves having immigration reform of some type.  Well, that's actually fascinating. And well, you are speaking Donald Trump's language there, I suppose. Is he about to pick up the phone? Do you want him to push this thing over the top? A lot of people say he's the only one who's going to do it. I mean, don't you think he's probably going to?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 444.331, "text": "Well, yeah."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 444.991, "text": "I mean, he's he. Just wait till Friday. Watch Truth Social and see where he is not shy about picking up the phone and telling members of Congress what they  what he would like to see them do. And frankly, on this, we're going to agree pretty strongly with the president that this needs to get across the line. And again, you cited those macro numbers, but we've broken it down state by state, district by district.  So members know exactly what is at stake here in terms of the number of manufacturing jobs that they will lose in their congressional district if they vote no, right? How much, you know, how much investment could potentially be lost? All that information is there for them to see. We have a calculator on our website. And by the way, anybody can go to that and take a look at what does that mean for them back home?  Well, that's fascinating. So when J. Tim is walking the halls of Congress, they know you're coming with some pretty hard truths. What's the more difficult meeting right now when you're knocking on doors on the Senate side or the House side? Because it seems like the nerves are on the House side, knowing that they might have to swallow whatever comes back.  They might need a guy like Jay Timmons to remind them of what's at stake here. So, you know, thank you, but it's actually the people in their districts that really matter, right? It's the folks that are on those shop floors. Are they calling? They are. And they are flooding congressional offices with messages of, hey, please support this bill. It's important for my job. It's also important for the health and strength and vitality of our community.  Again, I think members of Congress understand that. I don't blame members of Congress for trying to get something that is very parochial to their district. That makes perfect sense to me. In the end, we have to think about what is in the national interest. Getting this bill across the line is definitely in our national interest, as far as economic security and, I would argue, national security as well.  debt and deficits bother you at all? Yeah, they definitely bother me. And I think we're going to have to take a hard look at spending. But look, here's one thing I learned from George Allen, who was my mentor, and he was the governor of Virginia as his chief of staff. We were confronted with similar issues in Virginia, where you have to have a balanced budget. It's a requirement constitutionally in Virginia.  And he said, look, budgets are about priorities. And what is our number one priority? Our number one priority is to grow the economy so that more people benefit. We can have more taxpayers actually putting money into the Treasury so we can grow.  programs that help more people. So I think we have to identify that strengthening the business outlook in this country, the job creating outlook in this country and investment outlook is better for the American people as a whole. And then we can start looking at how do we manage the growth of some of these other programs that I would argue many of those are obviously very, very important. But you have to have the money and the revenue in order to fund those programs.  And that's what we want to do in the business community, right? We want to grow jobs. We want to grow the U.S. Treasury. We've spent the balance of this conversation with Jay Timmons talking about uncertainty for business, trying to make plans for the rest of this year. Tariffs play into that as well. How concerned are you about July 9th? What's going to happen? What are they telling you?  out of the administration, what to prepare for? You know, isn't it funny? You heard all along the way that, well, this bill's not going to pass the House. Well, the bill's not going to pass the Senate. Right now, Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House, and they are very unified. And the president is pushing the members of Congress to get things done on the tax side.  I think he's probably just as eager to get the 89 agreements that are still outstanding done. He said he wanted to get them done by July the 9th. We certainly hope he can. Yeah, yeah. How about extend this again if they're not all done? Well, that creates uncertainty too, right? So you'd just like to meet the deadline. So I want to see this get done. I want to see it get done in a way that benefits manufacturers in the United States, certainly, because I represent manufacturers in the United States, and what's good for  American consumers as well. One of the things that I think has been a bit of a hiccup. Yeah, just have 30 seconds. So we need to make sure that we can actually incentivize investment. So we have a proposal to provide an investment accelerator and we're going to be sharing that with you."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 711.121, "text": "A rebate, essentially."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 712.061, "text": "Talk to us more about that, Jay.

Just a few minutes ago aboard the aircraft, President Trump tweeting about the U.S. 's  what he calls obliteration of Iran's nuclear sites over this past weekend. He says the following quote, Israel just stated that the nuclear sites were obliterated. Thank you to our great B-2 pilots and all others involved. Doubling down on this obliteration language after, of course, the leaking yesterday of early reports from the Pentagon's own intelligence suggestions  that said that the preliminary read was that the US actually had only set Iran's nuclear program back by a few months.

So this is something that's still rattling around his mind here, and I guess he's got some reinforcement from officials in Israel. We wanted to play this to the panel along with the full-on reaction at this NATO summit to what just took place between Israel, Iran, and the US.

It's great to have both of you back for our conversation.  Ashley, what do you make of this? You spent enough time in the national security space. You've had a security clearance. You understand the sensitivity of this information. And the administration is telling us that these reports from the likes of the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, about the intelligence, telling us something other than the nuclear program was obliterated. Is this half-baked? Is it preliminary? How should we read it?  Yes, absolutely, Joe. And as you would expect, this one gets my blood boiling because I'm so happy that the FBI is investigating who leaked this information because talking about something that could hurt our national security is, it's just unbelievable that this is where some of these people are and that they're working for our government.  But there's 17 other areas of the intelligence community that are also reviewing what happened in Iran. And this is one of the 17. So we have 16 more definitely preliminary information. But it's frustrating me and sorry, I'm getting a little like my tempers coming out because it's like our our US military had just done an unbelievable  campaign with no American soldiers getting hurt, with the strongest military in the world ever, a country that has been sponsoring terrorism for decades with death to Americans, death to America. And we are having a conversation about some sort of intelligence that's not even 100 percent baked about if this is two weeks, two months or five years of how pushed back that they are in regards to making a nuclear weapon.  We're not taking the success of what we should have. And it is the fact that after years and decades of us trying to negotiate with this regime, it has never worked. The president did say he was going to do this and he did it. And now he's trying to broker a peace deal.

But even in the best case scenario, if their nuclear infrastructure was obliterated, there isn't a  international intelligence operative out there or any scholar who has looked at this who hasn't said Iran cannot rebuild this. And so the reality is the objective to denuclearize, is it best to do it via bombing like we did?  Or was it best to try to negotiate so we could get people on the ground to see how they're doing? The president chose the former. He chose to bomb. And now he is terribly frustrated by the reality that Iran will rebuild. It doesn't matter if they go to the negotiating table or not. In fact,  He has given every country out there who's looking at Libya, looking at Ukraine, looking now at Iran, what are they all saying? My gosh, I better rush and do what North Korea did and get myself a bomb however I can because that is the only way I'm going to defend myself.  And so this has worked at counter purposes. The president doesn't want to acknowledge that. He doesn't like to be challenged. But the reality is, whether they obliterated it or not, Iran retains the ability to rebuild. And no matter who is in power, regime change or not, they will do that. Why did he blow up the nuclear deal from 2018 and now try to reestablish it? He's got a lot of answer to answer to.

Mamdani, of course, identifying as a democratic socialist, has some pretty strong ideas of how to improve affordability  in New York City. So for more on his prospects in the general and how we should be viewing this from New York City is Laura Namius, who is our New York City and state reporter here at Bloomberg. So Laura, obviously Mamdani was relatively unknown until semi recently used social media to propagate these ideas like freezing rent, free child care, city owned grocery stores.

So he still needs to win another very big contest. And that may mean reaching out and trying to appeal to some of the people who didn't vote for him and who, frankly, might be feeling a little afraid of what he represents and what he might be able to do as mayor.

We have won because New Yorkers have stood up for a city they can afford.  Echoing the words of Nelson Mandela, it always seems impossible until it's done.

The mayor of New York City has very little power to affect tax increases unilaterally.  basically none actually. So he's proposing to pay for things like free buses and for universal child care through two mechanisms, an increase in the income tax, a 2% increase in the income tax on people earning over a million dollars, and  an increase in the corporate tax rate at the state level. Both of those things would have to be enacted by Albany and signed by Governor Kathy Hochul. She has already signaled that she won't sign that. And there's been some resistance to increasing taxes in Albany amid fears of exodus of the base of taxpayers who  help pay for a significant amount of the services that people enjoy in New York. So it's a question of what he can actually affect. Some things are a little bit easier for him to do. He does have power over the Rent Guidelines Board, which controls rent increases in rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments, but not market-rate apartments. He can't freeze the rent for everyone, of course. And city-owned grocery stores is potentially logistically difficult, but  and could face some significant opposition from labor unions, but is not totally impossible."}, {"keywords": ["Apple"], "line": 42, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1844.3, "text": "She's so good at this. Laura Namias, we thank you so much, Laura, for all your insights in all of our shows this week. Bloomberg New York City and state reporter on this day after the primary. We wanted to spend some time with Don Levy, not only because he understands the contours of the electorate in New York, but he's the preeminent pollster  in America and understands the challenges of ranked choice voting. How are we so far off in understanding where this was going? Siena College Research Institute Director, who we got to know real well in the 24 campaign, Don Levy, back with us on Bloomberg TV and radio. Don, it's great to see you. Is ranked choice the nightmare of a pollster?  Well, certainly between rank choice and a primary, that's a tough one for pollsters. The consensus of the polls as we approached primary day was that Andrew Cuomo would carry the election day. And if you added up all the various polls coming in, it looked like a six, seven, eight point perhaps win for  Cuomo on Election Day that was going to tighten as we saw ranked choices. Quite a few of the lesser supported candidates, including, say, Brad Lander, had cross-endorsed Mondani, and it looked as though it was going to get very, very tight when we moved on to the sixth, seventh round of ranked choice. But that's not what happened. Mondani had incredible momentum that was starting to show itself in some of the polling. In fact,  One poll had it as close as Cuomo only up by two points on election day, but it ended up flipping and Mandani carried that incredible momentum and an enormous turnout amongst young voters who have previously never voted in a New York City mayoral primary. So the momentum certainly was with Mandani and Cuomo's numbers really never moved. He was, consensus had him at about 38 points amongst  election day voters. He ended up at about 36. He never widened his base at all. And Mandani ended up picking up support from the lesser candidates and on his own. So really a shocking victory for a candidate that two months ago, when we last polled it, was little known to many New Yorkers."}, {"keywords": ["Apple"], "line": 43, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1983.558, "text": " Well, as you refer to the lesser candidates that Mamdani was able to pick up, the cross endorsement of Brand Lander was really something.

It's four years ago that he left office in a level of disgrace. This was an attempt at his comeback. He's going to have to make a decision. And right now, it appears with the current mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, on the ballot,  that Cuomo and Adams might be competing for the same voters. These will be voters who do not feel as though Mandani has the requisite experience, that he's too far left of some New Yorkers. There, of course, have been accusations of anti-Semitism against Mandani. So there's a lane available for another candidate.  It seems highly unlikely that there's a lane available for two candidates, both Cuomo and Adams. It'll be really interesting to see if indeed one of them decides to bow out. At this point, it really does look as though Adams is in. Cuomo is going to have to make a decision.  Really interesting, Don. So the idea of a four-way general seems less likely as we talk to you more. You're, of course, on Bloomberg, and we're talking in part to the investment community here, up with a story on our terminal today. Wall Street decries hot commie summer after Mamdani surprise. What is the conversation on Wall Street? What are they saying at lunch today on the Upper East Side as well? Well, certainly they're shocked.  And I think in your lead in, you certainly showed that Mandani does not have the power to do some of the things that he's talking about in terms of raising taxes, in terms of finding a way to perhaps frighten some of our Wall Street friends.  to pay for the ideas that he is campaigning on in New York. So there might be some New Yorkers on Wall Street who are discounting Mandani and saying that he'll learn. It's one thing to, as Cuomo called him, be a messenger. It's something else entirely to be the mayor of New York City.  So it's going to be a wild ride here over the near future in New York City, unanticipated. And I think you also raised this idea that there's going to have to be a complicated relationship between the governor of the state of New York, Kathy Hochul, and the mayor of New York City, if indeed it ends up being Mandani, that right now they don't seem to be operating on the same policy playbook."}, {"keywords": ["Apple"], "line": 48, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 2190.955, "text": " Well, to say nothing of the potential relationship or adversarial relationship we might see outright between a Mayor Mandani and a President Trump, if that's what we end up with, Don.

We're coming on the air with President Trump, set to hold a news conference at the end of the NATO summit in the Netherlands. It's been less than 48 hours since he announced that ceasefire between Iran and Israel, a fragile pause in fighting that seems to have held for now. You see the president there, flanked by his defense secretary and secretary of state. Let's listen in. Hi, sir. And it's a beautiful country, really a beautiful country. Coming in, I saw the most beautiful trees. In fact, I want to bring some back with me.  I want to also thank \u2014 I had breakfast this morning with the king and queen, and they're incredible people. I called \u2014 I said, you're central casting. Beautiful people. Great people. Big, beautiful heart. And I enjoyed that. And also, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who's been terrific. He's been a friend of mine. He used to be right here running this  wonderful country. Now, as the NATO Secretary General is doing a fantastic job, and the Prime Minister, we appreciate everything you've done. And as you know, last weekend, the United States successfully carried out a massive precision strike on Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. And it was very, very successful. It was called obliteration. No other military on Earth could have done it. And now this  incredible exercise of American strength has paved the way for peace with the historic ceasefire agreement late Monday. And we call it the 12 day war. Spoke to a few people. I guess that just sounded like the right the right name. It was a 12 day war. And we think it's over. I don't think they're going to be going back at each other. I don't think so. Not only have we dealt decisively with the critical threat of Iran's nuclear program, which was what I wanted, I said,  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I've said that for 15 years, long before I decided to do the political thing. But we've also reasserted the credibility of American deterrence, which is like no other. The people at NATO said there's never been anything. I rebuilt the entire military during my first term.  We have a great military. We have great generals. Got to know the good ones and the bad ones. We kept the good ones. Over the past two days, I was honored to participate in the NATO leaders' meeting and also had extremely good individual discussions with the king and the queen, Secretary General Rutte and the prime minister. Great discussions.  very knowledgeable people. Major focus of our conversations at the summit was the need for other NATO members to take up the burden of the defense of Europe, and that included the financial burden. As you know, it was 2 percent, and we got it up to 5 percent. And they said \u2014 a couple of them came up to me. One in particular said, Sir, we've been trying to get it up to 3 percent for  Twenty years, and we haven't been able, and you got it up to 5 percent. So they're going to be, most of them, I guess almost all of them, are going to be contributing now 5 percent, a number that people are surprised at. But you need it today. The United States accounts for two-thirds of all NATO defense spending. And since I began pushing for additional commitments in 2017, believe it or not, our allies have increased spending by $700 billion.  I said to people, you don't have any money, and a lot of them weren't paying. And so I started the process, and I picked it up as soon as I got back, which is six months ago. And following my election last November, almost all have accelerated plans to reach the 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, and then ultimately, very quickly, 5 percent.  And all of this is going to be done very quickly, almost immediately. You probably know this as well as I do. I'm sure they've been talking about it. It's really been a big focus. In a very historic milestone this week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase their defense spending to that 5 percent of GDP, something that no one really thought possible. And they said, you did it, sir, you did it. Well, I don't know if I did it, but I think I did.  This will be known as the Hague Defense Commitment, which is pretty good, pretty appropriate. When the Allies reach this number, it will add more than $1 trillion a year. Think of that, $1 trillion per year to our common defense. And this is a monument, really, to victory. But it's a monumental win for the United States, because we were carrying much more than our fair share. It was quite unfair, actually.  But this is a big win for Europe and for, actually, Western civilization. For years, past administrations failed to get most allies to contribute even the 2 percent. I remember when I came here, we had four countries that were up to 2 percent. And I remember Poland was there. A couple of them were there. And \u2014 but most of them were. We had 28 at the time. As you know, it's increased a little bit. And they've agreed now to more than double their budgets in all cases.  And Europe stepping up to take more responsibility for its security will help prevent future disasters like the horrible situation with Russia and Ukraine. And hopefully, we're going to get that solved. Last week, they lost 7,000 soldiers, mostly soldiers. But they're also getting hit in Kiev. They're getting hit in some of the towns also.  And that means life. Life is disappearing also in the cities and towns. Should have never happened, would have never happened if I was president. Said it a thousand times. And it never did happen. It's never even thought about. But it's vital that this additional money be spent on very serious military hardware, not bureaucracy. And hopefully that hardware is going to be made in America because we have the best hardware in the world. You saw that where 14 missiles were shot at us the other day.  And they were very nice. They gave us warning. They said, we're going to shoot him. Is 1 o'clock OK? They said, it's fine. And everybody was emptied off the base, so they couldn't get hurt except for the gunners. They call them the gunners. And out of 14 high-end missiles that were shot at the base in Qatar, all 14, as you know, were shot down by our equipment.  Amazing stuff, amazing that they can do. It's like shooting a bullet with a bullet. It's the same thing if you think about it. 14 out of 14, and they weren't even that surprised. I said, do you do that well often? They say, we pretty much do, sir.  The Ukraine crisis has also highlighted the urgency of rebuilding our defense industrial base, both in the United States and among the allied nations. We cannot afford to be dependent on foreign adversaries for critical minerals. And as you know, we made a deal with Ukraine to take a vast amount of the land they have for minerals we needed. And once again, I want to thank all of the people in the Netherlands, incredible people. It's a great place.  and all of the NATO allies for the tremendous summit that we just had. A letter just came in and a statement came in from the Atomic Energy Commission of Israel. And I just wondered, this is an official letter, and they're very serious people, as you know.  The devastating U.S. strike on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility totally inoperable. It was devastated. We assess that the American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities has set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons for many years to come. This achievement can continue indefinitely if Iran does not get access to nuclear material, which it won't.  Uh, it's so, so sad that that whole thing had to go. But I just, I just want to thank our pilots. You know, they were maligned and treated very bad, demeaned by fake news CNN, which is back there, believe it or not, wasting time, wasting, and nobody's watching them. So they're just wasting a lot of time, wasting my time. And the New York Times, they put out a story that, well, maybe they were hit, but it wasn't bad. Well, it was so bad that they ended the war. It ended the war.  Somebody said in a certain way that it was so devastating, actually. If you look at Hiroshima, if you look at Nagasaki, you know, that ended a war, too. This ended a war in a different way. But it was so devastating. Also, they have \u2014 out of Dubai just came that Iran's foreign ministry spokesman \u2014 this is Iran's foreign ministry \u2014 says it's near.  Its nuclear installations were very badly damaged by the American strike. So, what bothered me about these reports are with fake reports put out by the New York Times, failing, I call it the failing New York Times, because it's doing terribly. Without me, it would be doing no business at all. But, and by fake news, CNN, and MSDNC, all of these terrible people, you know, they have no credibility.  You know, when I started, they were at 94% credibility. The media, now it's at 16%. And I'm very proud of it, because I've exposed it for what it is. But when I...  When I saw them starting to question the caliber of the attack, was it bad? Well, it was really bad. It was devastating. They were obliterated. Like, you can't get into the tunnels. They just put that over. That just came out. They can't \u2014 there's nothing \u2014 there's no way you can even get down. The whole thing is collapsed and a disaster. And I think all of the nuclear stuff is down there because it's very hard to remove.  And we did it very quickly. When they heard we were coming, it was, you know, you can't move it. Very hard, very dangerous, actually, to move to. And they also knew we were coming, so I don't think too many people want to be down there knowing we're coming with the bunker busters, as we call them. We're the only ones that have them. We have the best equipment, best nuclear equipment, and we have the best equipment in the world. And by the way, we can't forget our submarine, which was out there. Submarines, actually. But submarine was out there. We shot.  30 rockets into an area, every single one of them, I think it was almost 400 miles away, I think, Pete, right?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "Unidentified SPEAKER", "start": 661.736, "text": "400?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 662.837, "text": "And long. It was in the ocean, long ways away.  And we shot a total of 30. Every single one of them hit within nine inches from where it was supposed to be. It took out a lot. Because we didn't do just Fordo, we did two others in addition, which hadn't been completely destroyed. So we hit them with a submarine from hundreds of miles away. Amazing, just amazing equipment.  Greatest submarines in the world. Nobody's even close at 20 years behind us when it comes to submarine technology. So that's one and the other was.  was from the Atomic Energy Commission. And they have about three or four of them now coming in from Atomic Energy Commissions from various places. But the one that we have that just came out, we released it a little while ago, was from the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission. But numerous of them are getting to see the site. And the site has been demolished. And again, we had these brave patriots, these incredible flyers, these people that  can fly a plane better than anybody can fly a plane, going into very hostile territory, flying into the territory that has got more missiles and things pointed at it. But it was very stealth. They didn't get to see it. It was dark. That's the amazing thing about the shots. They hit the shots perfectly. And yet it was dead dark. There was no moon. There was no light. It was virtually moonless.  It was very dark and the shots were hit perfectly. But when they get demeaned, and they were very upset about it because they knew how strong it would be. Back in Missouri, the pilots flew about 36 hours, two ways, far distance, and in those incredible B-2s. And we then had the F-22s, and we had the F-35s, and we had other planes. And we had, I think, a total of 52 tankers. That means the big tankers, because the refueling was a lot for all of the different planes that we sent.  Incredible operation. And I have to say, General Raising Cain was incredible. That's why he beat ISIS. And we beat ISIS in a matter of weeks. I was told it would take four to five years. We did it in a few weeks. And he was great. That's why he's the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff right now, because I had a very good experience with him. He knocked out ISIS in a period of literally a few weeks. Amazing. And it was supposed to take a few years, five years to be exact.  So we had a great victory there, and we then came here, and I think we had a great victory here. But this is an ongoing project. This is the safety of Europe, the safety of the world. And they've raised it from 2 percent to 5 percent, something which nobody \u2013 and you're talking about  over a trillion dollars a year, so we're talking about a lot of money from coming in from countries that we're not paying nearly enough to be effective. So I have, as you know, Marco Rubio with me and Pete Hegseth, secretary of state and secretary of war, should we say, secretary? You know, it used to be called secretary of war. Maybe for a couple of weeks we'll call it that.  because we feel like warriors. Used to be called Secretary of War. In fact, if you look at the old building next to the White House, you can see where it used to be Secretary of War. Then we became politically correct, and they called it Secretary of Defense. I don't know. Maybe we'll have to start thinking about changing it. But we feel that way. Do we have any questions, please? Wow. That's a lot of questions.  Uh, who's a nice person? Oh, you're not a nice person, but I'll let you ask one. Go ahead. What's he gonna ask? He is not nice at all.

And they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess someday it can. It could maybe start soon. I think a big telltale sign was when, as you know, Iran somewhat, by not much, violated the ceasefire.  And Israel had the planes going out that morning. There were a lot of them, 52 of them. And I said, you got to get them back. And they brought them back. They didn't do anything. They brought them back. It was very good. I thought it was amazing, actually. They have fought a hell of a war. They fought very hard. I think the war ended, actually, when we hit the various nuclear sites with the planes.  And I just hope you people can give these pilots, these are the best pilots in the world, they're the best shots in the world, they call them shots, that's what they are. And, wait a minute, and I just hope you can give them the respect they deserve, because they came home to fake news, and like, oh, gee, there was hardly any damage, the things are decimated. So, but I think, no, I think they're very much finished, I think Israel's gonna get back to  doing what they do, and I think that Iran's going to get back. You know, Iran has a huge advantage. They have great oil, and they can do things. I don't see them getting back involved in the nuclear business anymore. I think they've had it. They've been at it for 20 years. And I don't see that happening either. Now, if it does, we're always there. It won't be me. It'll be somebody else. But we're there. We'll have to do something about it. Yes. Please, go ahead.

Yeah, question for NewsHour, Dutch TV. First of all, on Article 5, on your way here, you spoke about the commitment of the U.S. to Article 5, saying, I'll give you my definition once we're here. What is your definition, and may the U.S. commitment to Article 5 change in case some of the NATO members do not reach the threshold that was discussed today? My second question is following up on a colleague on Iran, what intel reports  do say that everything over there was obliterated? Yeah, well, there are numerous of those reports and they're coming out fast and furious. But the most respected ones we've already seen, and I will say that on a very confidential basis, they're looking at the reports  like numerous reports, and including people going to the site and checking the site. And they're going to be having, I guess you're going to be having over the next couple of days a full, we're going to encapsulate it. But no, the site was obliterated, just like I said it was. And just like the pilots should be given credit for. As far as Article 5, look, when I came here, I came here because it was something I'm supposed to be doing. But I left here a little bit different.  differently, I said, I watched the heads of these countries get up.  And the love and the passion that they showed for their country was unbelievable. I've never seen quite anything like it. They want to protect their country and they need the United States. And without the United States, it's not going to be the same. And you can ask Mark or you can ask any of the people that were there. It was really moving to see it. They love their country. They were so respectful of me because I'm the head of the United States. And I made, you know,  The king of Saudi Arabia, when I was in the Middle East, so I was in Qatar for a different reason, not a reason to get shot at. We were in there for economic development reasons, Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia. All three leaders of those countries, and we took back $5.1 trillion into the United States. All three leaders said, you know, you're presiding over the hottest country in the world. The United States right now is the hottest country. Everybody wants to be there.  Everybody wants a piece of it. He said, a year ago, your country was dead. You had a dead head running it. You had a country that was dead, and it was dead. You had people pouring through the borders. You had inflation. You had everything. He said, you've made it in five months at that time. You've made it the hottest country. This is the hottest country in the world. The United States right now is the hottest country in the world. And when I was around that table, it was a nice group of people.  Many of whom I knew from previous, when I saw the passion they had for the country, almost everyone, and you probably have the tapes, it was very public, but almost every one of them said, thank God for the United States. Without the United States, we couldn't, they couldn't really have NATO. It wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. It will in the future because now they're paying much more money.  It wouldn't work. It was great. And I left here differently. I left here saying that these people really love their countries. It's not a ripoff. And we're here to help them protect their country.

Because it's more difficult than people would have any idea. Vladimir Putin has been more difficult. Frankly, I had some problems with Zelensky. You may have read about him. And it's been more difficult than other wars. I mean, look, we just ended a war in 12 days that was simmering for 30 years, frankly. We ended Rwanda and the Congo. They're coming to sign the documents. We've already signed basic documents. But they're coming, I think, to the White House on Friday.  We ended, Serbia was going to go at it. But maybe the most important of all, India and Pakistan. And that wasn't whether or not they may someday have nukes like we're talking about in the Middle East, like we're talking about with Israel and Iran. This is the half nuclear weapons. I ended that with a series of phone calls on trade. I said, look,  If you're going to go fighting each other, it was getting very bad. You know how bad that last attack was. It was really bad. If you're going to go fighting each other, we're not doing any trade deal. No, no, no. You have to do a trade deal. They said, we're not doing any trade deal. And in fact, I had the general, who really was very impressive. The general from Pakistan was in my office last week. You know, Prime Minister Modi is a great friend of mine. He's a great gentleman. He's a great man.  And I got them to reason. I said, we're not doing a trade deal if you're going to fight. And if you're going to fight each other, we're not doing a trade deal. And you know what?

Let me just tell you, you and NBC fake news, which is one of the worst, and CNN,  New York Times, they're all bad. They're sick. There's something wrong with them. You know what? You should be praising those people instead of trying to find something. By getting me, by trying to go and get me, you're hurting those people. They were devastated. You know, I got a call from Missouri, great state, that I won three times by a lot. And I got a call that the pilots and the people on the plane were devastated because they were trying to minimize the attack. And they all said it was hit.  But, oh, but we don't think it was really maybe hit that badly. And they were devastated. They put their lives on the line. And then they have and I'm not referring to you, but real scum, real scum come out and write reports that are as negative as they could possibly be. It should be the opposite. You should make them heroes and heroines. You should make them  really people that, they were so devastated when they heard this news. And you know what they said? One of them, I spoke to one of them, said, sir, we hit the site. It was perfect. It was dead on. Because they don't understand fake news, because they have a normal life, except they have to fly very big, very fast planes. But it's a shame. You should be making them heroes.

President Trump there, wrapping up that newsy press conference with reporters and preparing to head back to the United States after the NATO summit. A lot of headlines out of that, including the president making clear he believes, based on the intelligence he's seen, that Iran did not move nuclear materials out of that facility, Florida, one of the ones struck by U.S. bombs Saturday night.  He also, while not disputing the intelligence report that NBC News and others have reported on, downplayed its significance, as you heard there in that exchange with our own Kelly O'Donnell. The president also reiterating he believes that the facilities that were hit by the United States over the weekend were obliterated, and that while that ceasefire between Iran and Israel is holding for now, the president is not ruling out the fighting could start again, maybe soon.  He also says the U.S. is going to be talking with Iran next week, possibly to get some kind of a deal or negotiation there on its nuclear program. I want to bring in NBC's chief foreign correspondent, Richard Engel, alongside our senior White House correspondent, Garrett Haake, who is in the room.

And using his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to really go on offense against his own department's intelligence report, suggesting that perhaps these attacks were not as effective as the administration would like people to believe, making it an issue of the performance of the troops, rather than the effectiveness of the plan and what the intelligence is showing, also leaning heavily on Israel's atomic agency's assessment of a complete destruction of these nuclear sites.

He cracked that door open, Garrett. And I should note for the audience, you are at the back, or at the front, I should say, of a very large room. There's a lot of people walking in front of you. Folks don't need to address their TV sets. There's a lot of activity as this press conference is wrapping up. Garrett, I'm going to ask you to stand by for a second. But on this issue that you raise of Vladimir Putin, of Russia, I want to bring in our chief foreign correspondent, Richard Engel, in Tel Aviv. Because Russia is potentially integral to not just what's happening in Ukraine, but obviously Iran as well.  And I think it was notable to hear the president suggest that he does believe that Putin has territorial ambitions beyond Ukraine.  It's a good thing Garrett is tall. Yes, he was quite critical of Vladimir Putin, describing how difficult it has been to deal with him. Normally, he gives Vladimir Putin the benefit of the doubt and says, we don't want to criticize him too much. We want to have a great relationship with Russia. This isn't the first time he's said that.  confusion about Vladimir Putin, perhaps suggesting that it didn't understand him fully. And Vladimir Putin has been stepping up attacks in Ukraine recently. I just came from Ukraine. I was, Hallie, I was in Ukraine when the Israeli surprise attack happened and had to divert from Kiev all the way to here, going through several countries, airspace closed. And when I was leaving Ukraine, Russia was in the midst of an offensive.  At the time, it was only using drones, but it has stepped up its offensive. It's been overshadowed by events in the Middle East, but it has been firing ballistic missiles again. And it was attacking the city of Dnipro just yesterday with ballistic missiles, killing more than a dozen people. And Dnipro is right in the center of Ukraine. So Vladimir Putin is on the march.  He is moving forward. His troops are trying to take advances, move physically forward in the battle space. So this war, which Trump said he was going to wrap up, and he sounded quite optimistic about negotiations, there was this flurry of diplomatic activity, when there was this sort of desire to push Zelensky to sign the minerals deal in order to push the negotiations forward, that all ended.  There really aren't any negotiations right now. There is just an open war. And the fact that President Trump and Zelensky today both described their meeting as positive, and this sort of negative tone that he's casting on Putin, I think is indicative. But you also picked up a point. Iran, he's opening the door for, I don't want to say normalization, but moving beyond this war phase with Iran.  didn't say he has a problem with them exporting oil, says they're going to need to rebuild their country, they can sell oil wherever they want, and we want to move beyond this. And everyone has been focused on this intelligence report, this initial intelligence report. Did these centrifuges get blown up? Was the nuclear material destroyed? The fact that President Trump is saying over and over again, the material was destroyed, the facilities were destroyed, we want to move on,  is making many people in this region, in Israel and beyond, quite a bit reassured, because it's suggesting that a new round of conflict is not coming. Yes, well, there might still be fuel.

Is there going to be another round? Is the US going to take a second shot to make sure it cleared out that facility? Or those facilities, I should say.  Richard Engel, live for us there in the region. Richard, thank you. Let me go back to Garrett Haake, who is at that NATO summit. To the point that Richard's making here, Garrett, when it comes to Iran, when it comes to the discussions that the president alluded to, that Secretary of State Marco Rubio alluded to as well, we know that Steve Whitkoff has been, in many ways, the tip of the spear for those discussions and those negotiations.

So the way that our tool works is teacher actually works with the AI the way it would a TA. It calibrates, it grades together, the AI actually learns and adapts, and then it can suggest scores and feedback similar to the teacher.

And so when we think about the result, the data that says you can save six weeks of actual learning time with a tool like this, what you actually see is teachers have more time to prepare.  more time to actually build relationships with their students and more time to engage their families. And the part of the data that talks specifically about if teachers have access to it, they're more likely to actually believe and feel optimistically that students will learn, just means that we need to put the tools in teachers' hands as quickly as possible so that they can actually learn how to optimize it."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 147.028, "text": " I love teachers.

That was Zoran Mamdani declaring victory and Andrew Cuomo conceding defeat after Tuesday's stunning result in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary. Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist, centered his campaign on progressive policies like universal child care and free city buses.  His largely grassroots campaign was powered by small dollar donations and a savvy social media presence that included viral videos featuring progressive politicians and pop culture celebrities. Cuomo, meanwhile, ran a more traditional campaign backed by big name endorsements like former President Bill Clinton and a heavy rotation of TV ads. But controversy and scandal from his time as governor hung large over his candidacy.  The result has Democrats around the country wondering what Mamdani's victory really says about the state and the future of the Democratic Party. Here to dive into the numbers behind Mamdani's historic night is NBC News national political correspondent Steve Kornacki, who is, where else, at the big board. So Steve, how did he pull off this earthquake?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 93.97, "text": " Yeah, Chris, I mean, some really interesting numbers here when you take a look inside New York City. First of all, see the overall results here so far. Still some votes to be tabulated here. This won't be official for another week, but as you say, Cuomo's already conceded because look, you know, Cuomo felt he needed to be ahead after this initial account. They've got that rank choice system in New York.  It was pretty clear that a lot of these other candidates who weren't really in contention when their votes got reallocated in ranked choice, a lot of them had been saying to their voters, if you don't vote for me, vote for Mondani. So the question was, could Cuomo get far enough ahead last night to withstand that? He didn't even get ahead last night. So that's why this kind of became a foregone conclusion here. We'll break this down now into some of the neighborhoods, though, because I think that's where you really start to see this.  You heard Cuomo cite that young voters, he said, Mamdani had brought out done well with. Here's a tale of two neighborhoods in New York City. This right here, Bay Terrace in Queens, this is the highest median age of any neighborhood in New York City. And look what happened here. The oldest voters, that was Cuomo's base here in this primary. He won by a better than two to one margin over Mamdani. Take a look now, Morningside Heights. This is up by Columbia University.  This is the youngest median age of any neighborhood in New York City. And look what happened here. Mamdani won it. He won it overwhelmingly. Better than 2-1 against Cuomo. In fact, Cuomo came in third place in this neighborhood. So that's a pattern you saw. The younger areas were big areas for Mamdani. Also, this is a big divide we talk about in American politics.  It's big in the Democratic Party. The education divide. Mamdani doing so much better with voters who had college degrees or, look at this one, advanced degrees. That is a graduate degree or more. Almost half of the people, the adults in Park Slope, Brooklyn, have at least a graduate degree. And look at this. Mamdani got almost half the vote there.  Cuomo barely registered, only 13%. A third candidate here, Brad Lander, got 34%. Other end of the education spectrum, more blue-collar working class, no college degree. Almost 90% of the folks in Fordham Heights have no college degree. Look at this, Cuomo, again, a landslide for Cuomo there, nearly 60% of the vote, the education divide. And then, of course, we look among non-white voters here. I thought this is interesting because key  the Democratic Party base has been black voters. This neighborhood in Queens, 84% of the adult population is black. And Mario Cuomo, listen to me, Andrew Cuomo wins overwhelmingly against Mamdani. But Cuomo did not run up similar numbers among Latino voters.  and Asian-American voters taking a look here in Corona, Queens, highest Latino population, a share of the population. Look at this. It was almost a tie here. Cuomo narrowly winning. Cuomo's folks had been hoping his campaign had been banking on something much bigger than that here. Asian-American, highest concentration, flushing Queens, basically a tie right there as well. So that is that those two groups, the Latinos, Asian-Americans, early in the campaign, the Cuomo people thought that was something of a firewall. That  didn't hold up for them last night, and that was a very big key in Mondami's victory."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 294.741, "text": "Looking at a potential political realignment yet again, this time in the Democratic Party and the Democratic coalition.

I'll start by associating myself with the comments that she made about the importance of American soft power. Interestingly enough, over my years in the Senate, the biggest supporters of soft power I've run into have been the military generals, who were fully aware of how much more costly it is to have a war than to prevent one.  and it's at a very low cost to our country, built some pretty good relationships, particularly in countries in the Middle East that certainly wouldn't be described as democratic. Reforming the way we invest in peace and stability is certainly worthwhile.  And there's plenty of absolute nonsense masquerading as American aid that shouldn't receive another bit of taxpayer funding. But the administration's attempt to root it out has been unnecessarily chaotic. In critical corners of the globe, instead of creating efficiencies, you've created vacuums for adversaries like China to fill.  responsible investments in soft power, prevent conflict, preserve American influence, and save countless lives at the same time. So if we're concerned about spending, and we should be, it's important to remember what wars cost. At the height of World War II, 37 percent of our GDP was spent on defense.  In Korea, 13%, and Vietnam, 9%. The Reagan buildup, only 6%. Obviously, peace through strength means more than just saying it. It means actually demonstrating it. So that's just a fact that soft power  at very little expense goes a long way. And tellingly, some of the folks who talk most open about the importance of soft powers, I just indicated, are the military. That's saying, no, exactly what I've already said about the cost of having one. I welcome the President's intention to restore American hard power.  His repeated commitments to strengthen the military signaled that he understood this, like President Reagan, that peace through strength really has to be more than a slogan. Likewise, his authorization of this weekend's strikes over the objections of isolationists who downplayed the threat of nuclear Iran was another indication in the right direction.  But the administration's approach to funding the Department of Defense calls into question the ability to keep those campaign promises, a continuing resolution that forces the department to meet today's requirements with yesterday's dollars, a base budget request that fails to keep pace with inflation, let alone the pacing threat of China, and a reconciliation lump sum  crowded with priorities that require stable annual appropriations. Our colleague Chairman Wicker and his House counterpart had hoped that reconciliation would be a one-time injection on top of a growing base budget, not a shell game to avoid making the sort of annual investments we begged your Democratic predecessors to make.  I share this concern. We need sustained annual growth to meet the growing threats facing our country. At your confirmation hearing earlier this year, you said we have to use taxpayer dollars wisely. I couldn't agree more. I want to get the most out of every dollar the Department of Defense requires to keep America safe and advance our global interests by providing for the common defense  is our most fundamental obligation. Dividing funding for major existing bipartisan priorities between base budget and reconciliation isn't just counterintuitive, it's actually counterproductive. And asking Congress to fund a budget that defines our strategy  rather than using strategy to find the budget is dangerous. So let me understand a few things. Why haven't we received the administration's analysis of the future year impacts of major reconciliation in investments like gold and dome? How do you propose to pay for them without significant increases in future-based budgets?  Why has the administration taken programs of broad and longstanding bipartisan support, like the Virginia-class submarines, and put them in a partisan reconciliation bill? Finally, do you even believe we need sustained growth above inflation in our defense budget? Or should we expect annual cuts from this administration like we got from the Biden administration?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 362.121, "text": " Thank you Senator for the question and I do appreciate acknowledging the extent to which our budget does include both the base and the reconciliation levels and I understand there's disagreement on that front. Just from our perspective, we believe that the current appropriations  process is to some extent broken. We're living under a CR. So no matter what level was put forward previously, it ended up with a continuing resolution in which we do not see any increases for defense spending. Similarly, there are hot button issues that I think have kept the appropriations process. Think of the wall. Think of ICE programming that have kept it, the appropriations process,  from working and almost led to the brinksmanship at the end of the fiscal year. We certainly saw that in the first term. And so our view is that we can't afford, from the country's perspective, from a national security's perspective, to trust that the appropriations process will work as we all intend and hope that it would, and that we have to use Republican votes to secure the defense increases  the homeland increases, and even things like air traffic control and some other things. So from the standpoint of what does the budget reflect, it's a trillion dollars between both categories. Color of money is no different. And it will grow with inflation, which is not  abnormal for the types of assumptions put in a FDIP. It is not the full FDIP. We haven't gone through our national security strategy or national defense strategy. That is work in progress. But what we have been very clear about, and I will continue to be clear, is that when we do a fiscal year 27 budget, we will make an allocation for discretionary that could fill the gap. Right now it's in a  in an account that gives us the strategic decision to put it in a potential second reconciliation package or to do it through the discretionary process. But we believe it is vital that we get the trillion dollars in defense spending, that we get the border funding done, and that we don't put ourselves in a situation where we either rely on a continuing resolution or in a situation where we have to accept  a massive omnibus bill that contains things the administration doesn't support. We want the appropriations process to work. I actually think that this will lead to easier time, bill by bill, where you've gotten some of the hot-button issues out, but we'll see. But that is our intent, and I certainly thank you for the ability to explain where we've been on it."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 526.128, "text": "Senator Reid."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

This has been an honor. It was a fairly long trip, but worth it.  Tremendous things have been accomplished, as you probably noticed. I listened to a lot of wonderful speeches from the heads of a lot of wonderful countries. But I want to thank you for joining us at the conclusion of a highly productive NATO summit in the Netherlands. I want to thank them for the royal treatment they've given us. Couldn't have been nicer. And it's a beautiful country. It's really a beautiful country.  Coming in, I saw the most beautiful trees. In fact, I want to bring some back with me. I want to also thank \u2014 I had breakfast this morning with the king and queen, and they're incredible people. I called \u2014 I said, you're central casting. Beautiful people. Great people. Big, beautiful heart. And I enjoyed that. And also,  NATO Secretary General Mark Rutter, who's been terrific. He's been a friend of mine. Used to be right here running this wonderful country. Now he's the NATO Secretary General. He's doing a fantastic job. And the Prime Minister, we appreciate everything you've done. And as you know, last weekend, the United States successfully carried out a massive precision strike on Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities, and it was very,  Very successful. It was called obliteration. Nor the military on Earth could have done it. And now this incredible exercise of American strength has paved the way for peace with a historic ceasefire agreement late Monday. And we call it the 12-Day War. Spoke to a few people. I guess that just sounded like the right the right name. It was a 12-Day War. And we think it's over. I don't think they're going to be going back at each other. I don't think so.  Not only have we dealt decisively with the critical threat of Iran's nuclear program, which was what I wanted, I said, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I've said that for 15 years, long before I decided to do the political thing. But we've also reasserted the credibility of American deterrence, which is like no other. The people at NATO said there's never been anything. I rebuilt the entire military during my first term.  We have a great military. We have great generals. I got to know the good ones and the bad ones. We kept the good ones. Over the past two days, I was honored to participate in the NATO leaders meeting and also had extremely good individual discussions with the king and the queen, Secretary General Rutte, and the prime minister. Great discussions. Very knowledgeable people. Major focus of our conversations at the summit was the need for other NATO members to take up  the burden of the defense of Europe, and that included the financial burden. As you know, it was 2 percent, and we got it up to 5 percent. And they said \u2014 a couple of them came up to me. One in particular said, Sir, we've been trying to get it up to 3 percent for 20 years, and we haven't been able \u2014 and you got it up to 5 percent. So they're going to be \u2014 most of them, I guess almost all of them, are going to be contributing now 5 percent, a number that \u2014  People are surprised, but you need it today. The United States accounts for two thirds of all NATO defense spending. And since I began pushing for additional commitments in 2017, believe it or not, our allies have increased spending by 700 billion dollars. I said to people, you don't have any money. And a lot of them weren't paying. And so I started the process and I picked it up as soon as I got back, which is six months ago.  And following my election last November, almost all have accelerated plans to reach the 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, and then ultimately, very quickly, 5 percent. And all of this is going to be done very quickly, almost immediately. You probably know this as well as I do. I'm sure they've been talking about it. It's really been a big focus.  In a very historic milestone this week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase their defense spending to that 5 percent of GDP, something that no one really thought possible. And they said, you did it, sir. You did it. Well, I don't know if I did it, but I think I did. This will be known as the Hague  defense commitment, which is pretty good, pretty appropriate. When the Allies reach this number, it will add more than $1 trillion a year. Think of that, $1 trillion per year to our common defense. And this is a monument, really, to victory. But it's a monumental win for the United States because we were carrying much more than our fair share. It was quite unfair, actually.  But this is a big win for Europe and for, actually, Western civilization. For years, past administrations failed to get most allies to contribute even the 2 percent. I remember when I came here, we had four countries that were up to 2 percent. And I remember Poland was there. A couple of them were there. And \u2014 but most of them were. We had 28 at the time. As you know, it's increased a little bit. And they've agreed now to more than double their budgets in all cases.  And Europe stepping up to take more responsibility for its security will help prevent future disasters like the horrible situation with Russia and Ukraine. And hopefully we're going to get that solved. Last week they lost 7000 soldiers mostly soldiers but they're also getting hit in Kiev.  They're getting hit in some of the towns also. And that means life. Life is disappearing also in the cities and towns. Should have never happened, would have never happened if I was president, said it a thousand times. And it never did happen. It's never even thought about. But it's vital that this additional money be spent on very serious military hardware  not bureaucracy. And hopefully, that hardware is going to be made in America, because we have the best hardware in the world. You saw that, where 14 missiles were shot at us the other day. And they were very nice. They gave us warning. They said, we're going to shoot them. Is 1 o'clock OK? They said, it's fine. And everybody was emptied off the base. So they couldn't get hurt, except for the gunners.  They call them the gunners. And out of 14 high-end missiles that were shot at the base in Qatar, all 14, as you know, were shot down by our equipment. Amazing stuff. Amazing that they can do. It's like shooting a bullet with a bullet. It's the same thing, if you think about it. Fourteen out of 14, and they weren't even that surprised. I said, Do you do that well often? They say, We pretty much do, sir.  The Ukraine crisis has also highlighted the urgency of rebuilding our defense industrial base, both in the United States and among the allied nations. We cannot afford to be dependent on foreign adversaries for critical minerals. And as you know, we made a deal with Ukraine to take a vast amount of the land they have for minerals we needed. And once again, I want to thank all of the people in the Netherlands, incredible people. It's a great place.  and all of the NATO allies for the tremendous summit that we just had."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": "The former US President summarises the NATO summit outcomes.

Mr. President, we're here today to ensure the Senate fulfills its constitutional duties regarding the sole power to involve our nation in war. An important briefing will take place tomorrow and perhaps a vote on this very issue. Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution clearly states that the power to declare war is an explicit power of Congress. Three words, to declare war.  Congress overwhelmingly reaffirmed this constitutional provision when it passed the War Powers Act in 1973 over the veto of President Nixon. Under the War Powers Act, the President has the authority to approve military attacks as a response to an imminent threat or with the express authorization of Congress. Neither of these were the case with President Trump's decision to bomb Iran over the weekend. The Iranian regime  sponsors terrorism, wants to destroy Israel and undermine U.S. interests and repress its own people, and it is interested in owning a nuclear weapon. But those are not justifications to ignore the Constitution. If the United States is to start a war with Iran over these or any other issues, the Constitution itself requires there must be the consent of Congress.  Let me also add that we had an effective agreement that contained Iran's nuclear program. I remember it well under President Obama. That is, until President Trump in his first term abruptly withdrew the United States from this agreement, adding to the more volatile situation which we face today. That's why I support Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine's War Powers Resolution. It requires a prompt debate and vote prior to using additional U.S. military force against Iran.  This Senate should not allow the country to be led into another Middle Eastern war without its consent. Mr. President, when I reflect on the time that I've served in the Senate, one of the most memorable was on the question of the invasion of Iraq. If you recall that debate, the argument was being made by the White House that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and we had to preemptively start a war with that country to stop  those weapons from being used against us or our allies. We know what happened. There was a vote on the floor of the Senate. It was about 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at night. There were 23 of us who voted against the invasion of Iraq, one Republican and 22 Democrats. I believe it was the best vote I ever cast as a senator. There were no weapons of mass destruction. We were invading a country under a false premise. We were going to wage a war there and unfortunately did  at the expense of American lives for a long period of time. The Senate should not be led into another war in the Middle East without the consent of the American people through Congress. Our founders knew this point. One should never send our sons and daughters into war without the consent of the American people, an argument I've made regardless of who the president is, either party.  We have already ceded too much congressional power on so many different subjects. I'm almost speechless, and that's something for a senator. We're at a point where Congress continues to give away its power and its authority. I don't know how to explain it. I don't know why people would go through the awful challenge of running for office  to serve in the United States Senate, while each and every president tries to take away our authority to appropriate funds, for example, to make critical decisions. And so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing to give that away to their favorite president. Well, you give away that authority, and the next president may not be your favorite, but he'll have the authority that you ceded and gave away to the previous president. We've already ceded too much power on appropriations and other key items.  Let's not do that when it comes to war."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

But I don't think anyone expects us to have an ideology that has been driven into these dollars that we are trying to push all across the country. And that is exactly what this is doing. And when we look at this, the dollars that I know Americans care about are feeding hungry children, making sure that we don't have disease spread across the globe. And I have heard you and this administration say that you are committed to that.  So I want to give you just a minute to respond to my colleagues' comments and also talk about what programs you're putting in place and how you're ensuring that we can still, as the chair mentioned earlier, know the importance of soft power and know that if there is a void or a vacuum left, it will be filled, but it will be filled by people that we do not like.  And so I think Americans have a deep desire to help, a deep desire to do, but absolutely no one is sending their tax dollars to move forward a liberal ideology across the globe. So can you respond to that?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 125.861, "text": "Yes, thank you, Senator. I think it's a great opportunity to just articulate, also in conjunction with Senator McConnell's question, this is not a fade on soft power. This is a fade on waste, fraud, and abuse. And it's a fade on the extent to which it's not just wasteful.  It's not just wasteful to the taxpayer, it's bad foreign policy. When you're going into countries and you are putting forward the types of non-profits that are destabilizing to those countries and those cultures, what is their opinion of the American government? What is their opinion of the American people? So we're in the midst of a foreign affairs, foreign assistance review, it's ongoing.  It's being led by Secretary of State and myself, and we're going line by line in each one of these programs to articulate where we believe soft power could be effective, where we think that investment on the front end will keep us out of long-term hard power conflicts of that nature. And I think it will be a very revealing review, and we look forward to bringing it up and sharing it at the appropriate time."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 194.808, "text": " And you are committed to continuing to make sure where there is need and it is appropriate that we are working to help those across the globe."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 202.195, "text": "Absolutely.

In my few remaining minutes or seconds, so to speak, I want to take this opportunity to talk about something that is timely right now. And I would be remissed of having you in front of me and talk about it, and that's work requirements.  So, if you're looking at the impact of work requirements on the federal budget, I believe if you're an able-bodied, working-aged American without dependents, you should be working, training, volunteering, being educated at least 20 hours a week in order to receive government benefits.  I don't believe that's too much to ask. You're not taking anyone out of retirement. You're not taking anyone off of disability. You're not taking anyone out of the home. Our labor participation rate in this country is 62.4%. Alabama, unfortunately, is five points lower than that. Except for President Trump's first term, our labor force participation has consistently fallen since the year 2000.  Director Vogt, do you think it's too much to ask to ask able-bodied, working-aged Americans without dependents at home to work 20 hours a week in order to receive government benefits?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 266.307, "text": "No, absolutely not. It's, I think, a foundational principle that we should apply wherever we possibly can. We started to do this in the late 1990s with bipartisan historic welfare reform. And I think the American people probably thought at the time that we were doing it for the entirety of the federal government. We were just doing it at that time for TANF.  for cash welfare benefits, but we have tried to do this in Medicaid before in the first term. We had several regulatory proposals, and we needed statute to do it, and so it is incredible for the dignity of work to get people back in the workforce."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 297.602, "text": "The dignity of work, and in my remaining few seconds, just moving 4 million people, able-bodied, from welfare to work would boost the economy $149 billion.

I think the boost to the economy and the dignity that it provides individuals being part of something bigger than themselves would have a tremendous impact on this nation.
