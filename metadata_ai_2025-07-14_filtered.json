President Trump has made a very smart decision and an agreement with NATO, which says Europe and Canada will pay for the weapons. The United States will manufacture them. Obviously, we make the best weapons systems.  in the world, and everyone wants them, and we're going to prioritize those going to Ukraine. And what this says also to Vladimir Putin, I think, is very loud and clear, which is, you know, we've given you a chance for peace. President Trump is a peacemaker. But if you want war, we will arm Ukraine, and Europe will pay for it. And it's actually, I think, a great step in ultimately bringing this war to a conclusion, to an end. You know, in the last 18 months,  Russia has gained about 1% of Ukrainian land. I mean, they're making no success. They're losing thousands of soldiers every single day. And way too many private citizens in Ukraine and the big cities are being injured. So I think this is a great next step in finally ending this war. But again, if Vladimir Putin wants to continue to fight on the battlefields of Ukraine, the United States of America will sell Europe armaments so that they can be used by Ukraine to defend themselves."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 117.7, "text": " Matt, like his predecessor Jens Stoltenberg, Mark Rutte appears to be a big fan of the president.

But this is a natural progression of what we did in The Hague at the NATO summit, too.  We move the burden off the American taxpayer for European defense and on to European taxpayers, where it should be. And the traditional defense of Europe is now going to be borne by the European population. And at the same time, we're doing the same thing with the Ukrainian war. President Trump said today $350 billion of American taxpayer money has gone to support Ukraine. No longer. But at the same time, we're not cutting them off from weapons, and we're also  also not making the United States of America less secure. We're going to make sure that strategically we have enough that we need and then anything else that we can make, manufacture and sell to our European allies and give to Ukraine I think is a perfect and elegant solution for this."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 231.64, "text": " And now there's this idea of secondary tariffs, 50-day deadline.

Obviously, President Trump is the master dealmaker, and I think he saw an opportunity here to not only, you know, bring jobs to middle America through  making weapon systems. You know, I've seen some of those manufacturing things like in Lima, Ohio, where they build tanks, for example. And so I think there's a real opportunity here to help the U.S. economy, but at the same time help Ukraine and Europe's going to pay for it. And so, but obviously, Secretary Ruta is a very  important piece of this and I look you know every day that I work with him is enjoyable because he's such a professional and he is equally working hard to make NATO strong and make most importantly Europe strong because President Trump said it today when we were talking to him and that is is that a Europe a strong Europe as a Europe that can deter Russia frees up the United States to address all of our strategic concerns across the globe and that's a good thing for everyone."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 363.687, "text": " I mean, it is so interesting to see opponents of the president whining about him, insisting that NATO nations pony up and do their share.

So essentially what was happening was that short sellers were building up around that 110K to 120K level. And then they were forced to cover as Bitcoin broke to new highs,  And that's a move that really echoes what we saw in late 2024 when Bitcoin jumped from $70K to $90K in just a few weeks. And if you're looking at a similar 30% breakout from here, like if you're going from a base of $110K, that would suggest upside toward $140,000. And you guys hit this off the top of the show.

You've got everything from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds to corporate treasuries that are now allocating to Bitcoin, especially after the Department of Labor cleared the way for crypto exposure and 401k plans this May. On the Bitcoin treasury side, you've got companies like GameStop and even Trump Media that are following the Michael Saylor play  book, treating Bitcoin as a strategic asset on their balance sheet. Trump media plans to acquire $2.5 billion worth of BTC. And according to Bitwise, those corporate treasury holdings jumped 23% last quarter, topping $91 billion by the end of Q2. And at the same time, in terms of what we're seeing in the markets, you've got this wave of reverse mergers that are turning dormant public companies into public treasuries.

There's legislation to establish stable coin oversight, a market  infrastructure bill that would define jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC, among other things. And then a third piece of legislation designed to block the Federal Reserve from issuing its own digital currency, which has long been seen as a combatant to the crypto industry.

You've got, normally, you'd see a major upheaval in the bond market, because rates would just go through the roof with instability there. If you listen to Kevin Haslett today, and I think he's a smart guy, he's got zero credibility for what he says, that tariffs aren't going to impact the buyer, meaning the consumer, or companies. I can tell you, in the supply chain, as we look at it in some of our companies,  Aluminum's up 50 percent. So, source from the U.S. The U.S., the companies here are not fools. They now see a pricing umbrella 50 percent above where they were. So, where are they? They raised their prices 35 percent. So, even if you don't pay the tariffs, you're going to pay it here. And, look, companies that have EBITDA margins, like grocery stores, like many others, the auto companies,  They're mid-single digits at best. They can't absorb the tariffs to operate a law. So we'll come through. So the question is, back to Trump. He said there are deals. There are no deals. There are letters that he's saying, this will be our deal. The deal takes two parties. So he's going to have to renegotiate. The question that you bring up,  At some point, he's not going to tackle it. At some point, he's got to say, we're doing this, not just with steel and aluminum, but more broadly, so every other country feels it. The critical countries are, of course, India and the EU and Japan. Once you get through those, then the others really don't matter. So I think you've got to see some deals or some maybe fake deals, like we did with the UK, where it really doesn't matter. In terms of the overall risk in the market, it's definitely the Fed.  You can't put a complete dove in there. It's definitely tariffs. It's also inflation that could come from the spending bill that was just passed. And then it's more cuts they're talking about. So I think that the market's going to continue to ignore these risks, as they have for the last year. And the market accepts, OK, in just the final word, earnings.

So my argument would be, while we determine exactly what that level is going to be, after a truly historic rally off the lows,  Some breather is in order.

Which is kind of fascinating, because of course that didn't work out too well for GE, and yet even some of Musk's own allies have sort of alluded to viewing him and his empire as sort of a modern-day General Electric.  He did take pains to say on NX that he does not support a full-blown merger of Tesla and XAI, but he has signaled on there multiple times now that he would be in favor of Tesla putting money in.  That's, of course, a proposition that could be helpful if XAI continues to grow its valuation.

You've got a good point, Paul. Private label has been consistently growing and got a huge bump since the pandemic. And part of that is that the retailers have really invested in the quality and the differentiation of those private label brands. So where consumers now really consider them not just a replacement for national brands, but in some instances, just regular brands of their own right.  And so, you know, Kraft Heinz actually had reduced some of its exposure to private label when they sold off the planters business, when they sold off the cheese, like the shredded cheese business with Kraft. But the core grocery business, they do still have a lot of exposure to private label. So is this a lot of competition from, let's say, startup food companies appealing to younger consumers? I mean, what kind of sparked this?  Well, there's really been a shift in the way consumers are looking at brands. And unless you own a long legacy brand that you can reinvent and really drive interest from younger generations, it's really hard to keep that going. And so what we've seen is that they've done a good job with revitalizing things like Philly cream cheese.  But despite a lot of investment, brands like Capri Sun, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House, these brands just aren't resonating with younger consumers. And that means that the growth prospects for those brands are a lot lower. And that makes it hard to really bill yourself as a growth-type oriented company."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 590.191, "text": "So I know, as I think back to my M&A memory banks 10 years ago, Kraft and Heinz  Berkshire Hathaway had a big hand in putting these two companies together and look now they're still the largest shareholder with just under 28% of the stock.

I mean, over time, Berkshire Hathaway has actually done quite well out of this deal, even though Kraft Heinz as an overall entity is probably disappointed in the overall analysis. But the merger was in 2015. It's been 10 years. The value of the deal at the time in 2015 was $45 billion. Today's market cap, it's $32 billion. And yes, they've sold off a couple of brands.  It just hasn't materialized to be the type of growth that I think Berkshire Hathaway initially envisioned it would happen. Jennifer, can you dig more into some of the advantages but also the risks associated with breaking up the company?  Obviously, some of the advantages, and this seems very similar to what Kellogg did when they spun Kellanova and WK Kellogg out into two separate companies. They separated the growth prospects and then those from the slow growth areas. That's very similar to what Kraft Heinz seems to be doing. Obviously, if you can focus on growth areas, that gives you undivided attention to really expand and grow.  That would be an advantage. I think one of the disadvantages, and this is something that's kind of a broader question to consider, is whether there's a cycle that's starting. Because we've seen companies like Kelinova split. We see Unilever spinning off their ice cream business. And those new entities are now being bought up by others. So you've got Mars acquiring Kelinova. You have Ferrero acquiring WK Kellogg.  But in order to get regulatory approval, you have to have categories that aren't overlapping. And so you're seeing a new birth of new kind of conglomerates of dissimilar portfolios. And so it makes me wonder if we're setting up another cycle where in another five years, 10 years, we're going to see these companies that have been buying up the underperforming brands going through a similar type of activity."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 731.292, "text": " What's driving all this?

So, what this will do is that it will greatly diminish the overall amount of trade that is done. And I think, importantly also, what that means is that Trump's threat to match any possible EU retaliation to those 30 percent probably is not very influential for the EU, because the initial hit  to trade has already been so large.

What do you mean by diversify, move away from one sort of core customer? No, not really. We're expanding, right? So we're definitely working with Tesla, but we want to work with other established OEMs as well as startups. So it's part of our efforts to expand our strategy and manufacturing output as well. What signals has Tesla given you about its future orders, about the health of its business?  Your guess is as good as mine. But we have a long-term relationship, longer than anyone else. And they're still a very important strategic partner for us. And I believe our partnership is very strong.  Throughout the morning, there was a lot of discussion of how Kansas was the absolute best candidate. What were the biggest factors in choosing this site? Were they financial? Were they simply the ability to get things done? Lack of red tape? Why were you able to move so quickly?  So we talked about the available workforce and the infrastructure. I mean, you saw the power lines built by the factory and as well as the energy procurement that we can do. But more than anything, there was something very special about Kansas.  All the officials were able to work with us, and you probably heard that Lieutenant Governor Toland making some of his speech in not only Japanese, but in Osaka dialect. And that level of insight and care and support really made a difference. And it doesn't matter what party they are, they're very committed to bring us here, but also make us feel home.  So that kind of partnership, not just numbers and infrastructure, but emotional partnership made the difference. And we're so happy to celebrate today. What I was going to say on the numbers is there is a job creation story. So 4,000 direct jobs. I think the number is 20,000 indirect jobs when you take into account supply chain, construction.  What have you had to do to kind of bring the other infrastructure you've needed to DeSoto, have everything you need around you? So what was great about planning it out, like I said, we started two and a half years ago, and at that time we worked with local schools and community colleges to create curriculums.  So when we start for manufacturing, they are there ready, already taking the courses and be available to take a job here. To guarantee you have the skill sets that you needed? Absolutely, absolutely. So we created curriculum together and it's been a really good partnership and it helps us and it helps the community and it's like wonderful win-win.  The headline figure was that Panasonic put $4 billion into this DeSoto facility, but you were also, the reported number is eligible for almost $7 billion from the inflation reduction act. How much of that materialized?  We haven't started the manufacturing here, so we have not seen the incentives yet. They're set against milestones. Yes, yes. So it comes with the production, so we're looking forward to it, and it's definitely a big part of our investment. Do you anticipate that you will get access to the full tranche of money?  We certainly hope so. Things have changed. I mean, things have changed even since you and I spoke in January. There is some effort underway to reshape or undo the Inflation Reduction Act. It seems like the $7,500 credit which goes to the consumer of the vehicle will go, but the 45x manufacturer credit seems intact. How have you navigated that? Is that your read on the scenario as well?  So we're still very hopeful that it should remain, and I think it should remain. It's not only for us, but it's for creating jobs and manufacturing and bringing technology to the U.S. So, so far it's very positive, and we're hopeful that it stays. It will be a big part of our long-term strategy.  What's the supply chain story right now for DeSoto, Kansas? When you think about your raw material needs and everything that goes into the sale process, are there things that are still difficult? What are they? Or has bringing this facility online been smoother because of policy?  We have been planning for the supply chain resilience not just for this and recent tariff situation but from COVID. During COVID we really suffered from weak supply chain. I mean I think all the industry did and so did we. So we've been planning for supply chain resilience.  And we are, I mean just for our benefit too, to make sure that those supply chains stay local and within the North America. And our goal is to complete 50% of our supply chain by 2030 to be completely local.  Are any of the conditions currently associated with that 45x manufacturer credit difficult when you think about foreign entity of concern or parts of the supply chain, which in the context of metals, China is still a factor here? Yes.  So, we started partnering with China for the supply chain resilience. We are trying to diversify and make sure the supply chain is more resilient to make sure that we can procure and process on site. So, it's not really a new change for us necessarily. We've been trying to do that for a few years. Where are the bottlenecks right now, if any?  I don't know. It's really the refining process to make sure that we can find a supplier who can make sure that the quality is there, right? The refinement, the quality matters for our quality production. So that's where we pay most attention to make sure that the raw material is ready for quality EV batteries, right? It's good for everyone. For consumers, we want to make sure those EV batteries are tested and safe.  I know this might seem far-fetched, we are just bringing this facility online, but one of the questions I got from you from the audience is what happens next? You have Nevada, you now have Kansas. Does Panasonic see further sites? For EV in the first instance, what is your next priority?  It's TBD. Today's the first day of this operation, and we're really excited to make sure that this goes smooth, producing quality EV batteries. We'll focus on that first, and if it goes well, who knows, right?  Demand is still a question. What I find interesting is a lot of the customer base is pure plate EV, but the lesson we've learned in the last 18 months or so is hybrid is still a big part of the market. Maybe in a way that surprised many. Do you have the ability to tap into demand for hybrid from this facility or others?  We don't know yet, but we're pleasantly surprised that EV sales still rose by like 11.4%. So that's a good sign. And like I said, this is a long-term play. So we're not going to be happy and sad with the small ups and downs. We're still bullish that EV markets should grow and hybrid transition should be part of it.  Have you done a sort of side-by-side analysis of the economics of a single cell? Bring mine back out. I have one single 2170 cell here. So this will be manufactured in Kansas, not subject to tariffs. You have the Nevada facility, but Panasonic Energy also has facilities all around the world. Is it just an instant fix that the cell on a unit basis  It's just a more attractive economic proposition if it's built here in Kansas for the American market versus shipping sales in from your overseas facilities. It makes a lot more economic sense to produce here, right? Bring raw materials here and produce here.  And we're cutting in for some breaking news here. We have President Trump in the White House with the NATO secretary-general. Take a listen. That was President Trump with the NATO secretary-general announcing that he was, quote, unhappy with Russia and is threatening secondary tariffs of 100 percent on Russia if a deal with Ukraine is not reached.  But first, let's get to some breaking news that crossed the wire. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, took to threads to say that the company will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in computing to build superintelligence. Shares rose off the news, and let's get right to that with our very own Kurt Wagner.

He's even admitted  Some companies, presumably his own, will overpay on AI in order not to fall behind. So hundreds of billions on infrastructure. But I think, Jackie, when you look at this, why it makes sense is you recall over these last couple of weeks, they've been spending very aggressively to hire AI talent for this superintelligence group. And I think this commitment to the infrastructure side is meant to sort of go hand in hand with that. OK, so we've hired the talent. We have the people in the building that we think can build this thing.  And now we're putting the money behind the infrastructure to help support them."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 859.4, "text": "Kurt, this announcement has fresh resonance, especially as some of Meta's competitors are making their own moves to really bolster their AI ambitions.

And I think that's just become more and more prevalent.  especially as XAI has grown. And so we learned that SpaceX, for example, is now investing $2 billion into XAI. We've seen that Elon Musk plans to put a shareholder vote to Tesla shareholders asking if Tesla should invest in XAI. We obviously know XAI and Twitter already merged or X already merged. So this notion that all of these different sort of  businesses of Elon's are now contributing to the AI business, I think is super notable. And you can see there are some, you know, to use the terrible cliche, synergies between these companies, right? The idea that Grok might be distributed through Teslas is one example of that.

And so I think if you're Elon, you just say, look, you're putting in money now into a technology that's going to be worth 10, 100 times more down the line, but also you're going to get all of this data, this infrastructure that I'm building at XAI, and it could  could potentially benefit Tesla as well, again, as you improve self-driving, as you take Grok, for example, put it into the cars. So if I'm him, I paint this as very much like a rosy marriage between the future technology and putting all of that into an automobile, which I think they're already doing.

Thanks for joining us. Coming up, Lucid Interim CEO Mark Winterhoff joins us from the Panasonic EV battery plant in Kansas. More next. This is Bloomberg Tech.  Welcome back to Bloomberg Tech. We're live in DeSoto, Kansas, at Panasonic's brand new EV battery plant, 4.7 million square feet, at full capacity, which will happen later this year. Some news we broke with Panasonic's North America CEO, Megan Myung-Won Lee, 30 gigawatt hours of capacity. That's enough cells for 500,000 EVs per annum. One of the key customers, Lucid, and Lucid CEO Mark Winterhoff, interim CEO Mark Winterhoff, is with us now.  This is a significant moment for you as well, because it's your first domestic supply of cells. Reflect on that. That is true. Currently, we're getting our battery supplies either from Japan or from Korea, depending on the supplier. And Panasonic is a great partner for us. We decided two and a half years ago to make together this investment here and to localize the production, the cell production here to Canada.  It's not just volume supply. This is 2170, but my understanding is there was some co-engineering to make this as good as it can possibly be. Explain how that works. It's a great collaboration between our engineering departments and their engineering department. We bring in a lot of experience on what the cell is supposed to do in real life, and they make it happen with chemistry and with all of the parameters of the cell.  So it was really, really great collaboration. And that we also then are able now to produce this here locally, obviously in the current climate, helps us a lot.  How did the economics of the De Soto Candace May 2170 stack? I know that you love charts and spreadsheets as much as I do, but you must have done that analysis. Oh yeah, absolutely. What's it like? I would say we wouldn't have done it if it wouldn't be economically feasible or beneficial.  As I mentioned before, we made that decision not just recently. So tariffs were not on the radar screen at that time. We did that decision two and a half years ago. And at that time, together with the 45x incentive tax credit, the economics make sense. I still have to say, and I hope that Panasonic hears that, that there's some room of improvement. But also right now, obviously with the tariffs, this is a very good move for us.  because the same cell that would otherwise have come from Japan or Korea is subject to tariffs. It is. That's a part of the equation. That is correct. And the other thing that we are currently working on together with Panasonic is obviously further localizing the supply chain for the cell, because it doesn't do you a lot of good if you manufacture here, but you still import the raw material, which is then subject to tariffs.  So, we're already doing a lot of investments in that. You heard about our Graphite One investments on the graphite and other materials. So, we're working with them on making that happen as well. Mark, I've covered Lucid for a number of years. This is the first time you and I have spoken and I'm grateful for your time. Your predecessor, Peter Robinson, had a very simple argument. Lucid had the best technology on the hardware side and software battery management system.  And even though your journey started in the premium segments, that you would scale to volume because you would just say, this performance and range in this pack, we can just scale it down, make a more affordable version. Have we hit that inflection point yet?  Well, I mean, we're about to. You know, everybody knows by now that follows Lucid that, you know, we are very, very strongly working on our midsize platform. Right. Which is a, you know, smaller platform also from a price point perspective, more in the round in the $50,000 range and not where we are right now.  And that's when we really hit that inflection point. But with the gravity that we are ramping up right now, we are already expecting to have much higher numbers than we had in the past. Right. I think, you know, there's a lot of work to do in the second half of the year to reach 20,000.  What role does the DeSoto plant play? Will you be able to get hold of sales from here for vehicles sold or delivered in this calendar year? No, not yet. That is something for next year and again with our partners with Panasonic we are working on opportunities to further bring this in because obviously in the current climate that is very important for us to localize.  We've focused this morning a lot on policy. You brought up the 45x credit, but the consumer credit of $7,500, likely no more. What can you do in that environment with the vehicle? Are you able to pull forward lower price point variants? Are you looking to just appeal to the premium segment on an ongoing basis?  Well, first of all, when it comes to our current vehicles with the AIR, it might not be widely known, but we are the best-selling vehicle in our segment, the best-selling EV. And we also were in the second half of last year. Actually, no, in the beginning of this year, we were the best-selling vehicle in the whole segment, including ICE vehicles. So the AIR is actually doing well, although the numbers are obviously, when you look at the broader scheme of things, are not that high yet. But that's because of the size of the segment. Right.  With gravity, obviously we're now reaching a different scale, and we're still ramping up the production, and as you said, we have to do quite a lot in order to get to our target for this year, but it's going well. We're unclocking some of the blockages that we had in the supply chain, and our plant really got into the groove to create the vehicle.  So I would say the inflection point of having really economics of scale is still a little bit out. We're still more appealing to the higher price segment, that's what we have. And I mean, in automotive, you cannot just decide, oh, let's put out a new, cheaper variant next week. It takes years to implement, to plan, to engineer, to validate. So that's sometimes not well understood.  Manufacturing and building great cars is a long-term game. And you have to build also economics of scale over time. It's not something that happens from one day to the other. But I'll hold you to it. 20,000 is realistic this year with the time left to you. We're in a quiet period right now, so I cannot really talk about it. I suggest you tune in in our earnings call on August 5th. I will do. And you will definitely hear about it.  and the mid-sized platform is on track for next year. And the same applies to that as well. We're working very hard but on August 5th there will be news on that. The other part of Lucid's history was the idea of partnerships, manufacturing partnerships, licensing technology. Has that idea changed given the political environment?  No, actually, no, it hasn't. So as a matter of fact, and I said that in the last couple of months, and everybody honestly, understandably asked me, okay, where is it? Where is it? Again, those things take time. And particularly in the last couple of months with the uncertainty of the terrorists, I have to say,  Many of the people we had conversations with, they have other issues. They have pressing things to solve right now in the last quarter. We also on top of that had the magnet shortage, which actually halted production for several players. So those discussions still happen on our EV core technology. But also beyond that, stay tuned, there will be other news also coming.  Are those potential partners motivated by the environment, the effort to onshore industry in this country to work with American companies? There are different things. First of all, right now with the perceived slowdown of EV adoption,  especially companies that have both ICE vehicles and EVs, they can only invest the dollar once. So, right now we see, let's say, shift back to ICE vehicles, and therefore, but they still need to come out with new models, and therefore we have increased interest in, hey, can we do things together? And I expect this to continue, actually.  You talked a moment ago about being dominant in your segment, the lead seller in that segment. But everyone always asks me, if somebody is put off buying a Tesla vehicle, I drive a Tesla vehicle, a Model Y, but there are many out there that say, I don't want to buy a Tesla vehicle. Have you any data that says those buyers turn to Lucid in the pure play categories that you operate in?  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, as I just said, we're now the best selling vehicle in the United States in our segment. That includes the Model S, our segment. I mean, I don't compare right now the gravity because we're still ramping up. We're in the phase of ramping up. I guess let's talk again by the end of this year where we stand on the gravity. But the air, yes, we see a lot of incoming. We always actually, by the way, had a lot of interest from Tesla buyers. That's not really new.  But it has increased. Absolutely. This administration is fascinating in Lucid's context. Maybe the pro-EV policy is not there, but supporting U.S. manufacturers is. You also have the relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the administration in the context of GPUs, for example, has been supportive in those trade deals. What has the experience been like leading this company under the Trump administration? And net-net, how do you think you've come out so far?  Well, I mean, obviously things became more complicated. I mean, the tariff situation, I mean, there's no doubt it increases our cost. And it also creates a lot of additional headache, because you now have to completely rethink the supply chain. Are you continuing certain things, or are you localizing? Again, that's nothing that happens from one day to the other. We are doing okay.  when you compare to other players in the industry, also from the cost increases, particularly because we build everything right now in the United States. We build all of the vehicles, our key components, they're all built here in the United States. Having said that,  We are hit by obviously raw materials or let's say tier two suppliers that we have to import and we have to pay tariffs on that. So it's not that we are not impacted but we are less so than others. So yeah I mean it's something we have to work with.  And for us, it's also because we are a pure EV manufacturer. We believe in the future of electrical propulsion. We're not wavering. We're not saying, oh, let's do, I don't know, a range extender or something. That's not going to happen with Lucid. This is part of our vision, you know, that this is the future and actually important to save our planet. So we will find a way through this, but also I have to say,  For the American consumers, vehicles are going to be more expensive under the tariff regime. There's no other way around it. Yes, you can say, oh, you just need to localize. Well, yes, but that still increases the costs, because there's a reason why the supply chain is so global, because certain things are either not available here in the US or are just very expensive, so you import them. And if you change that, you still have higher costs here in the United States, which means  Manufacturers like us, or actually any manufacturer, has to increase prices. There's no other way, unless you want everybody to be non-profit organizations, which then would lead to no innovation, no technology leadership, and I think that's, in the current climate globally, it's the last thing we want.  The cost of doing business in America. Mark Winterhoff, Lucid's interim CEO, one of the core customers at this Panasonic DeSoto Kansas plant that is due to hit full capacity this year.

The Trump administration has already dropped a lot of lawsuits that the Biden administration had brought against crypto companies, sort of letting it be trading free for all.

And so Treasury has to figure out how it's going to finance the deficit overall.  And they're making a series of moves. So, number one, they've delayed how long it will take to refill the Treasury general account. Number two, they're going to change the supplemental leverage ratio rules. Number three is that they are going to do more buybacks and increase the amount of T-bill issuance and how crypto falls into that or how stablecoin falls into that.  Once you pass the stablecoin legislation, it creates this extra T-bill demand, and it could be as much as $800 billion. So Congress is passing a stablecoin bill this week. That should set the stage to kind of fill that liquidity. And if you're in a country and you're trying to get money out, then the Bitcoin is a way to get around it.

So further sanctions or tariffs, or whatever you want to call it, on Russian exports to the US, that's unlikely to have a major impact because there's not much that Russia is sending directly to the US.  The real impact would be to come at countries, again, China and India primarily, who are buying a lot of energy from Russia, and that's giving Russia access to hard currency to fund their war in Ukraine. And if you penalize China,  and India for buying oil, for example, from Russia, that could have an impact. But that's the question of where we're unsure if that's how far Donald Trump is prepared to go. For now, he's threatening this. He's not actually saying he's going to impose it, but he's putting it out there in the conversation."}], "keywords": ["Trump", "China", "Export", "Tariffs"], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "Analyses the President's statements, noting his frustration, the threat of economic penalties on Russia (possibly secondary sanctions on China and India), and the provision of defensive weapons to Ukraine paid for by Europe.

And I think Mark will tell you that it was really perhaps more important the date of November 5th. That was the election day. Maybe that was the most important because we've made tremendous progress together. And one of the reasons that you're here today is to hear that we are very unhappy, I am, with Russia.  But we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with them, and we're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. Tariffs at about 100 percent. They call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And, as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine.  And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it. And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there. So, based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. It's very simple. And they'll be at 100 percent. And that's the way it is. It can be more simple. It's just the way it is. I hope we don't have to do it.  But regardless, we are going to be \u2014 we make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's missiles \u2014 you saw that recently in Iran, the way those planes flew in. They had every single \u2014 14 bombs hit every target. Then you had the helicopters shoot a total of 30 bombs, 30 missiles. And they hit every single \u2014 Marco, is that right? \u2014 every single piece, every single target. And it was \u2014  I guess on a scale of zero to 10, they say it was about a 15. That's how successful it was. That's how lethal it was, a word they like to use nowadays. But it was an amazing, well-organized attack that people in this country wanted to do for 24 years. You know, when we had the pilots in last week, they were saying, sir, we've been practicing this for 24 years, meaning people, not them, but other people that are a little older now.  But they do. And you were the one that let us do it. But we've been practicing it three to four times a year for 22, 24 years, because they always knew they had to stop Iran from doing what they were doing, which is trying to come up with a nuclear weapon, a nuclear bomb. And we did it very successfully. And we make the best equipment, the best missiles, the best of everything.  The European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And they have \u2014 these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too. But we're in for a lot of money, and we just \u2014 we don't want to do anymore. And we can't.  But we make the best, and we're going to be sending the best to NATO, and in some cases to maybe, at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany, where they're going to send early-on missiles. And they'll be replaced, and NATO is going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here, who's a great ambassador. And Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So, in a nutshell, we're going to make top-of-the-line weapons, and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something, and it'll be mostly in the form of a replacement. And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy, for having had the career that he's had, because he had an amazing career  before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months. And if you could say a few words."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 287.637, "text": "Absolutely. No, no, Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big. This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want to bring what it needs to have to maintain  to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent, but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production.  So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have the Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more. So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need.  So if you can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hexhead at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days at this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them. So I really want to thank you for that. And it means the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries. We will deal with that. And exactly as you said, it might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here. So, really, thank you. This is important. Thank you."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "Apple"], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 414.699, "text": "The President You did a great job. That's a really great job. We've been very successful in settling wars. You have India, Pakistan.  You have Rwanda and the Congo. That was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled. And they did. And they were both great. Great leaders. And they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years. And at least 7 million people killed and killed with  A lot of pretty rough weapons, like machetes. Heads chopped off. Going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near. It's so frightening. And we got that one solved. Serbia, Kosovo. Got that solved. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I used. I used strafe for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars.  And that was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here on the Strip, the Gaza Strip. I call it the Gaza Strip. One of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace. It brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Witkoff is here, and I think we could have something fairly soon to talk about.  And we solved another one, one that we just seem to have, Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with an extra neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which  closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we're working on that one problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that. You've been hearing about that one. And that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam.  But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income in life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia. I'm not happy. And I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started.  If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye. But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they didn't have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. And I was outside looking in. And I said, you know, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started.  It's a real mess. We're losing \u2014 I guess they're losing 5,000 or 6,000 people a day. It's actually now more. I used to \u2014 I was saying 5,000 a day. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up, too. It's a horrible war. And it should be stopped. And so, if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing \u2014 secondary tariffs. And they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do, but I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk, and then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people. It's got to stop. It's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars' worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States, going to NATO, et cetera.  And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance. And they still would have had no chance if the equipment \u2014 they had the best equipment. Because we do make the best planes and missiles, and we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. And we have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about \u2014  the Golden Dome, it's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage, because somebody has to use that equipment. And they fought with tremendous courage, and they continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they don't have \u2014 they're losing on equipment.

Yes, you can say, oh, you just need to localize. Well, yes, but that still increases the costs, because there's a reason why the supply chain is so global, because certain things are either not available here in the US or are just very expensive, so you import them. And if you change that, you still have higher costs here in the United States, which means  Manufacturers like us or actually any manufacturer has to increase prices.

I mean, they are missiles, but they are intended to intercept incoming missiles. They're most effective against incoming missiles than any other kind of projectiles, but the reality is they can take out other projectiles as well. One thing that really stood out to me in the president's announcement right there was when he suggested  that one country alone may send as many as 17 batteries. That's not 17 individual interceptor missiles. That's batteries. A battery is made up of a radar, a control station, multiple launching stations. Each one of those can fire off multiple interceptors. So a battery in and of itself  A new one right now is upwards of about a billion dollars, Hallie. The interceptors themselves, they range in price depending, but they can be well over a million dollars as well. I mean, frankly, even as much as six million, depending on the variant. But no matter what, this is an expensive system.  Only a handful of countries in the entire world operate a battery. And I think there's only two or three. I was trying to do the research as the president was talking there, that have as many as 17. The United States is one. Japan has only a few more than that. So one country sending 17 batteries is an enormous  investment by that country. Now, one thing that the president suggested there also is that the United States would work with NATO to distribute these. Remember, the United States several years ago set up a military command. It's known as SAGU. That's Security Assistance Group Ukraine.  It's a command based in Wiesbaden, Germany that is the whole purpose of the command is to distribute security assistance to Ukraine. Hallie, I could see that NATO in some way will be more even closely coordinated with SAGU as a way to effectively and efficiently distribute things like these Patriots and any other potential  defensive weapons that the United States decides to sell to these NATO countries, or what also sounds less about, it also sounds more like this is a swapping. The United States would sell newer systems to the countries and they would provide their older systems to Ukraine. That's something we've seen go on quite a few times already in the past several years since this war began, Hallie."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 292.019, "text": " Courtney Kubi, our senior Pentagon correspondent.

Now, with this legislation finally signed into law by President Trump, Main Street businesses will be able to expand, and working-class Americans will take more money home in each paycheck.  The golden age of America has arrived. Thank you. Madam Speaker, this past weekend marked one year since the attempt on President Trump's life in Butler County, Pennsylvania. While we thank God that President Trump's life was not taken, we mourn the loss of an innocent father, a firefighter, and a proud Pennsylvanian  Cory Comparator, political violence of any kind has absolutely no place in our society. Yet the violent rhetoric coming from my colleagues across the aisle has not stopped. Now, a year after the assassination attempt on President Trump's life, they have turned their violent action toward our colleagues, ICE agents, who work every day to protect our communities.

President Trump is in the Oval Office right now with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. And he says one of the reasons Rutte is here today is to express their disappointment with Russia and the president saying he will be imposing secondary tariffs on Russia of up to 100% 50 days from today, beginning September 1st, unless Russia agrees to some sort of a deal for a ceasefire or to end the war in Ukraine.  So, it's important to remember, guys, the U.S. does not have much of a trading relationship with Russia on its own. It's severely decreased over the past few years as this war has been ongoing. But secondary tariffs, we have to wait to see the fine print and the details. But, ostensibly, these would be designed to punish any countries that are still trading with Russia. So, think about the top importers of Russian oil at this point. It's China, India, Turkey. To some extent, we could see secondary tariffs now on those countries of up to 100 percent, according to the president.  as soon as September 1st.

The European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too.  We're in for a lot of money and we just, we don't want to do anymore. And we can't, but we make the best and we're going to be sending the best to NATO and in some cases to maybe at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany where they're going to send early on missiles.  And they'll be replaced, and NATO's going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here. He's a great ambassador, and Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So in a nutshell, we're going to make top of the line weapons and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something and be mostly in the form of a replacement.  And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy for having had the career that he's had. He had an amazing career before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months. And if you could say a few words. Absolutely. No, no, Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you don't want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent.  but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defence industrial production. So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have the Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more.  So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hexhead at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for that. So I really want to thank you for that. That means the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here. So really, thank you. This is important."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 243.734, "text": "Thank you."}, {"keywords": [], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 243.954, "text": "You did a great job.

India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled. And they did. And they were both great. Great leaders. And they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years.  And at least 7 million people killed and killed with.  A lot of pretty rough weapons, like machetes, heads chopped off, going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near, so frightening. And we got that one solved. Serbia, Kosovo, got that solved. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I used. I used strafe for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars.  And that was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here on the strip, the Gaza Strip. I call it the Gaza Strip, one of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace. It brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Witkoff is here. And I think we could have something fairly soon to  talk about. And we solved another one, one that we just seem to have Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with an extra neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which  Closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we're working on that one problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that. You've been hearing about that one.  And that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam. But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income and life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia.  I'm not happy, and I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started. If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye.  But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they're going to they're going to have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. And I was outside looking in. And I said, yeah, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started.  It's a real mess. We're losing, I guess they're losing 5 or 6,000 people. There's actually now more. I used to, I was saying 5,000 a day. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up too. It's a horrible war and it should be stopped. And so if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing. Secondary tariffs and they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do. But I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk. And then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people.  It's got to stop. It's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars' worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States, going to NATO, et cetera. And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance.  They still would have had no chance if the equipment, they had the best equipment, because we do make the best planes and missiles. And we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. We have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about the Golden Dome. It's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage because somebody has to use that equipment.  And they fought with tremendous courage and they continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they don't have, they're losing on equipment. And Russia has really taken a very positive, very, very  strong, I mean, what they've done in the last couple of weeks. Without military reasons, that's what they are doing. 700 drones a day, missiles, bombing cities. This is not because of military goals. It is just creating panic, keeping people out of their sleeps, hitting towns. It's really terrible. And it is meaning a lot of people lose their lives, but also the infrastructure, whole cities being  They're wiping out the electric. It's going to take years to rebuild it. That's going to be the next problem. But that's going to take a long time. Many of the cities are knocked down to the ground. Many of the people have left. But many have stayed. I don't know. They actually stay. Most have stayed, actually. It's incredible that they stay, knowing that a missile could be hitting your apartment house.  And your apartment house that you're sitting in could collapse on top of you. And they do very heavy construction. They don't use rebar. They do very thick concrete construction. Those are heavy buildings, big buildings and heavy buildings. And they collapse like  like they're made out of paper. It's unbelievable to see this happening with people, so many people being killed. So we think we're going to make progress and we hope we're going to make progress. In the meantime, we're going to get you good service on what you need. And we really became friendly with NATO this last meeting. You know, we went from 2% to 5%, which everyone said  was not even a possibility. They weren't paying 2%. Many of them were paying much less than 2%. But even those, since you became president, all committed to the 2% before the summit. And now, collectively, we committed to the 5%. That's right. They did. They've been very good. And I think I made a lot of friends over there. We had a couple of days of very intensive talks.  And they're great people. They're leaders of countries, leaders of countries. Many of them great countries, some of them smaller countries. But for the most part, that's a very solid, strong countries and very successful. Some of them are among the most successful countries in the world.  So that's the story. We hope that's going to have an impact on Vladimir Putin. And we hope it's going to have an impact on Ukraine also. We want to make sure that Ukraine does what they have to do. All of a sudden they have, they may feel emboldened or maybe they don't want, you know, this is a very  difficult situation. Ukraine wants a peace deal. I think so. And they will stay committed to that. There's no doubt they want it. But the Russians have to be. They have to continue to want it, though.

I look at a room, there's a room where we have many, many people working, responding.  sending letters back.

And so there's, I think, a lot of patriotism in the data. The bottom line is, people prefer American products,  And so, therefore, the demand for imports has gone way down, down so much that even with what tariffs have been there, where people would say, oh, they might increase prices at least a little bit, we have seen prices going down. The other factor, don't forget, is that, if we have a trade deficit year after year after year with a country, then, by definition, they're supplying stuff to us inelastically. And so if you have an inelastic supplier and you put a tariff on them, then the inelastic supplier bears the tariff.  I think putting it all together, we haven't seen it in the data.

Hey, it's good to see you. Should the Federal Reserve be working with the administration's plans or goals, or should it operate independently?  Oh, the Federal Reserve should be independent.

There may be some offsets with USMCA, but the bottom line is this. Automakers have said, what production do we have in the US?  how or capacity, excess capacity, how can we use that to build more vehicles in this country? And look what we found. J.D. Power ran the numbers for us. They track this every single month. And what they found in the first quarter, 51% of the vehicles sold in this country  We're built in the U.S., but look, it's gradually increased since then, up to 54 in April, 55 May. Last month, 56% of what was sold in this country was built in this country. Bottom line is this, the automakers have found those areas where they can add a shift.  at overtime, at plants that are already running, and that's what they're doing. They are adding production at those plants. It's not a lot, but it is sizable enough to move the needle in terms of amount of vehicles built in this country. The sales rate is slowing down. I get this question from people. They say, well, there was a surge in April. People were worried about prices skyrocketing.  So they went out and bought them. And yes, it has come down, though. 15.3 million, according to Cox Automotive, was the sales pace last month in June. The average transaction price, by the way, really hasn't ticked up much. It might be a couple of hundred dollars higher.  in June than it was back in April and March. 48,907 was the latest reading in terms of what people actually paid at a dealership.

And this one is close to my heart because whenever we see a Mexican tariff headline, specifically here in Europe, there's one stock that always moves off of it, and it's Diageo, because they are one of the largest sellers of tequila.  there, I think something like 10 or 11 percent comes revenue, is exposed from that Mexico to U.S. or U.S. to Mexico tariff. But, of course, the exports coming from Mexico to the United States. Nevertheless, if you were into tequila at 7 in the morning or any other time, this is the one for you. DGE is this ticker for the London listing, which is actually higher this morning by 0.7 of 1 percent. But for our American audience,  Keep your eye on the ADRs. It's also listed in the U.S. markets. DEO is your ticker, and those shares are down about four-tenths of one percent. It's likely to shake out at the open, but this kind of arbitrage, basically this difference between the two listings on both sides of the Atlantic, is also something you're seeing in another big European company that has a lot of exposure to the United States, and that is Novo Nordisk. So again, alongside your tequila, if you want some Ozempic with it as well, this is the stock to keep an eye on, because Novo Nordisk is a Danish  company, 60% of their exports go to the United States. Of course, as they kind of capitalize on this weight loss theme, those shares are higher by two-tenths of 1% in the European session. But again, if you look at those ADRs, that's where you see the pain. So, NVO, only down about one-tenth of 1%. But earlier in the session, it was down  Far far more and that's the one you want to keep an eye on so keep an eye on some of these European ADRs That have a lot of exposure to America specifically Exposure to these tariffs another space that we're gonna be looking at specifically is the auto sector And that's where you got to go to your favorites you got to go to Ford you got to go to General Motors Both under pressure this morning a lot of the has to come with their supply chains that extend into Mexico So Ford shares which are the ticker just the letter F trading just shy of $12 a share down about three-tenths of 1%  General Motors is the other. GM is your ticker there. Down a whopping 1.7%. But I'm not seeing a ton of trades in the stock just yet in the pre-market. So, just keep an eye on how this one shakes out as we get closer to the opening bells on Wall Street. Trading at about $52 and change this morning. A couple of others that you want to definitely keep your eye on as we talk about trade, as we talk about the chip sector.  Synopsys is one that's catching a lot of attention and is your biggest volume mover to the upside. SNPS is your ticker. This is one that has seen quite a bit of scrutiny when it comes to the deal flow with China. It looks like China's conditionally approving the Synopsys and Ansys deal. This is a big deal when it comes to their chip supply chain. It was a $35 billion deal.

But it's also the reestablishing of deterrence around the globe. And that's why what happened through Operation Midnight Hammer was so important. By the way, a mission from the beginning, President Trump set the tone of what that would look like, the effects that would happen. He understood exactly, and our job was simply to execute.  and to watch the skilled and courageous men and women of our military from beginning to end, from the situation room, to the maps, to the trajectories, to hearing the radio calls, I wish everybody could hear that and see that. It makes you so proud to be an American. And it reestablishes an understanding for the world of what we're capable of. No other country on Earth could even remotely do what those pilots did.  plan, coordinate, facilitate, refuel midair, you know, dozens of times. Seven jets going one way, two deceiving the world the other way. Everybody thought it was going that way. You zig, you zag. Fly over Iran. They never see you. They don't shoot. You disable enemy capabilities, and you get out of dodge. Or as President Trump says, he said, skedaddle. You skedaddle.  That is a specific military doctrinal term. Now, that was not just a message to Iran's nuclear capabilities. It was a message to all of our adversaries and all of our allies that American leadership and strength is back.  We've also sent the message to the world, through what President Trump has done in Europe and through NATO, that the era of freeloading off America is also over. I'm a big fan of alliances, and we're a proud member of NATO. But an alliance can't just be about flags.  and conferences. It needs to be about formations and capabilities. Military alliances only work when you have actual hard power to bring to bear. And only because of President Trump is Europe stepping up and spending now what was inconceivable. Many of these countries were spending 1% on defense just in his first term. But because of President Trump's leadership, they're committed now to spending 5% of GDP on defense, which means they lead the way, and we don't have to do it for them.  So in closing, I just want to never forget that the motto of our great country, when I got criticism for starting a monthly prayer service at the Department of Defense, voluntary prayer service, I reminded our friends in the media, you know, the motto of our country is, in God we trust.

That is leadership. That is putting America first. That is showing strength. And I commend you for that. But I also hope, on behalf of a new and improved Department of Defense, that you will also take a look at serving your country, that you will consider the incredible lineage  Let me tell you something. I've never met someone who served, it's very few and far between, who regrets the day that they raised their right hand to defend their nation and try to test themselves to see whether they can stand up to the legacy of previous generations. Now, it's my job and it's President Trump's job to make sure we use those troops properly, that they're properly trained, that they have a clear mission, a limited objective that everyone understands.  And they've got the best equipment in the world, which President Trump is providing. But what we really need are the best young Americans. So thank you for being here. God bless our warriors.

Bloomberg News has learned the European Union is preparing to step up its engagement with other countries hit by President Donald Trump's tariffs. Let's go to London and get the very latest with Bloomberg's James Woolcock. Good morning, James.  Good morning, Nathan and Karen. The EU is reaching out to the likes of Canada and Japan to see if there might be a unified global response to America's trade aggression. This reporting from Bloomberg comes after the US president issued a new ultimatum of a tariff rate of 30% over the weekend on the block.  Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that rate of 30% would hit exporters in Europe's largest economy to the core. Talks are still stuck on several issues, especially cars and tariff rates on agriculture, but if levies do go up in two weeks' time, the EU is prepared to retaliate on roughly $84 billion worth of US goods, risking further trade escalation. In London, James Woolcock, Bloomberg Radio.  All right, James, thank you. Well, President Trump will be heading to the U.K. for his second state visit. King Charles will host the president in September. Trump had warmly welcomed the offer of another state visit to Britain when he was handed the invitation by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February. The U.K. was the first country to sign a tariff reduction deal with the U.S. in May.  Before the president heads overseas, Karen, he may have found a new pressure point for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The president and his allies have been seizing on cost overruns at the central bank's headquarters renovation as they continue to hammer Powell for leaving interest rates unchanged.

Ukraine had been receiving weapons from the U.S., but only with money remaining from former President Joe Biden's time in office. President Trump had previously refused to consider seeking additional funds, arguing it would only harden Russian President Vladimir Putin's stance and dim chances to end the fighting.  Nathan, former President Joe Biden is pushing back at one of President Trump's harshest claims about his mental acuity while he was in office. In an interview with the New York Times, the former president said he made all the clemency decisions that were recorded with an auto pen and that he had orally granted all pardons and commutations issued at the end of his term. And he says President Trump and Republicans are, quote, liars for claiming his aides used an auto pen without his authorization.

Bitcoin is now up about 30% since December.  Nathan, we're starting to see some of the impact of the U.S. trade war with China. China ended the first half of the year with a record trade surplus of about $586 billion after exports to the U.S. began to stabilize. Exports rose year on year by a higher than expected 5.8 percent in June. Shipments to the U.S. fell 16 percent from a year earlier after slumping by over 34 percent in May.  And staying in Asia, Karen, the slump in Japan's long-term bonds is accelerating, pushing yields sharply higher in a move that puts global debt markets on alert. While the pressure in Japan is being heightened by a looming election on July 20th, concerns over government spending beyond their means also apply to the U.K., Europe and U.S.  Time now for a look at some of the other stories making news in New York and around the world. For that, we're joined by Bloomberg's Michael Barr. Michael, good morning. Good morning, Karen. Two women were killed and two other people were wounded in a shooting at a Lexington, Kentucky church in a rampage that began after a state trooper was shot and wounded. Authorities said the suspect was also killed Sunday. In a news conference, Lexington Police Chief Lawrence Weathers says it began after the trooper pulled over a vehicle near the airport.  The trooper had pulled over a vehicle on terminal drive after receiving a license plate reader alert in the area of Versailles Road. The trooper was shot and the suspect fled. Chief Weathers says the suspect then carjacked the vehicle and fled to the church where he began shooting at people there. The suspect was later killed by Lexington police. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is set to meet President Donald Trump this week.  NATO said Ruda will be in Washington today and tomorrow and will meet with Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as members of Congress. Attorney General Pam Bondi is said to have fired multiple Justice Department employees who were involved in two federal prosecutions of President Trump during the Biden administration.  The Washington Post reports, according to several people familiar with the terminations, 20 people were fired from the department, including two prosecutors who worked under former special counsel Jack Smith. Reports of increasing tension between A.G. Bondi and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. There are new details now about a confrontation the two had last Wednesday, with Bongino reportedly storming out afterwards.  Former U.S. Attorney General Chris Christie says he believes the decision went all the way to the top. There's no chance, in my opinion, that Pam Bondi made this decision on her own. No chance. She was instructed by the White House that we're not releasing this stuff. And that's why he's defending her.  Former AG Chris Christie was on ABC's This Week, heard Sundays on Bloomberg.

Negotiations had been proceeding with the assumption, really,  the working assumption that perhaps there might be a lower tariff rate, but also particular carve-outs for some industries. So we're talking about German automakers or alcohol exports from Europe, things like that. So there really had been a lot of progress made in kind of a complex formula.  The president saying, you know, it might be 30 percent and we'll leave it at that. It's you know, this could be just another negotiating tactic. You know, it's only July 14th. August 1st is still a long ways away. But the EU signaling that they want to work more closely with some other  U.S. trade partners who are perhaps feeling the same kind of heat, including Japan and Canada. That's not clear what exactly they might do. They might share some tips on what's going on in their own negotiations.

I guess the problem  Michael, with age restrictions and saying that there's a cut off, is that people age at different rates, don't they? I mean, Donald Trump is only a couple of years younger than President Biden. And yet he looks to be much more physically fit. He certainly has much, much more energy than Joe Biden did.

It's almost as far from DC to LA as it is from DC to London. So it allows us to cover more of the stories that we want to bring to our audience.  It's also, though, to be able to tell the story of how DC policies impact people outside the beltway. When you're in DC, and I lived in DC for 18 months, you're surrounded by the story. A lot of the people that you come across in coffee shops and restaurants, they're also journalists, lawyers, Capitol Hill staffers.  Here it's a lot more varied in terms of profession and in terms of demographic too, so you know under Biden sort of the day-to-day political chat with my friends here was limited, it's just not their world. What I have noticed though is since  Trump took over for a second time since his policies became more extreme. It is something, you know, I'm waking up to messages from my friends in LA asking about what he's doing, you know, because it is having a real life impact here that they can see in front of their eyes.

Charlotte from Tunbridge Wells, in fact, Charlotte asked several interesting questions.

Constant fascination with where is Melania? What is she thinking? And how can she possibly lead this life? Well, you know, she was more present certainly in the first term. We didn't see much of her though, did we, during the 2024 presidential campaign. She came to Donald Trump's side at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. That was almost immediately after  the unsuccessful assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. She was a supportive presence from then. She did, you know, appear more on the campaign trail, but she has definitely taken a backseat this term, staying out of the spotlight. When he became president, she said, you know, I will be splitting my time between Washington, D.C., New York and Florida. It seems like she spends a heck of a lot  more time in New York and Florida than she does in DC. She did have, you know, she does have these brief forays back into the spotlight. She actually championed a bill which is very laudable, criminalizing the spread of AI-generated deepfakes and revenge porn. It's a subject, you know, I've done some reporting on.

Then when we got there, the person who was doing this briefing said, OK, actually, we'll do this on background, which means that you can quote me as a senior Israeli official.

So infrastructure wise, it's  not a huge job in terms of the stadiums and the sports arenas. What is a huge job is making this city at all accessible. The public transport network, you don't need me to tell you, is famously bad here.  There's been some work going on at the moment to build what's called a people mover at LAX, which is the city's main domestic and international airport. Incredibly, you can't get to LAX at all by train at the moment. So this people mover will connect the metro and the subway to it.  That is already underway. Who knows when it will be finished?

There's also obviously been, you know, riots across the city because of Donald Trump's immigration policies, you know, swear words graffitied on government buildings here.  I'm sure though that Donald Trump will want LA 2028 to be a huge success. All leaders do, you know, having the Olympics in your country is a hugely prestigious thing and it's also something that a lot of leaders use to  disguise unpopular policies to cover up poor popularity ratings to, you know, put a gloss on their reign and distract from less favourable things.

And so that works into our economic forecast numbers. But the commodity prices, quite frankly, are just all over the charts because of the dramatic uncertainty. Most of our investors are focused on commodities like gold and oil and don't dig too far into the commodity indices. But when we look at commodities, they truly are really all over the charts because it's very difficult to understand how the policy and the tariffs and the trade considerations will affect those utter blank commodities.  But I think it manifests itself, at least in our forecasts, on inflation that remains fairly pernicious and stays above the Fed's stated 2% target."}, {"keywords": ["Tariffs"], "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 280.296, "text": "Interesting.

We see, for example, GDP growth in the Americas for 2025, we're estimating, you know, one and a half percent GDP growth, but we're looking at CPI or inflation. And, you know, can we have some releases this week that will tell us, but we see inflation coming in almost at 3% and actually accelerating into 2026.  And that is directly because of this concern about how tariffs are going to flow through to the consumer and how they're going to keep inflation fairly high. Now, the markets seem to be unfazed by the tariff talks. The markets seem to believe that we're going to get to August 1st and either we'll have a favorable outcome or things will get pushed back again. And so they are completely unfazed, at least if we look at the, you know, at all time highs and continuing to be there.  And so on a macro level, we think that this bull market that we've been experiencing continues to have legs. It continues to have momentum. But the real place to keep an eye out is going to be the bond market. Because at some point in time, a lot of the things that were in the big, beautiful bill, a lot of the things that are coming into the economy because of increasing tariffs, at some point in time, the bond market is going to give us a signal.

These are actually attractive levels.  especially when you look at spreads for high quality municipal bonds for taxable investors in the U.S. or corporate bonds. We're seeing an opportunity there to get nice returns, but that does not mean it's not going to be volatile in the short term. And that's the real challenge for the bond investor is to take a look at it.  pick your yield, say this is the yield that I think is going to work, and recognize that next week, next month, that might feel like a bad decision, but by next year, you'll be glad that you're sitting on that high quality paper."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 435.67, "text": "Does the big beautiful bill at any point in the future begin to negatively impact the muni market, particularly at the state level?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 444.603, "text": " Well, that's a fantastic question, and I think that that has been structurally appears to be something that's been pushed down the road a little bit.

And so that is going to create some challenges. It's going to create pressure for things that are being put on states and municipalities. There's been a lot of  bond issuance, especially by municipal issuers there this year to try to get out in front of this before rates potentially go up.

I think one of the questions is whether the international equity markets, especially the Eurozone, whether it's fully caught up or is there more room to grow? We think that selectively looking offshore, holding foreign currency, holding gold, that those are nice hedges, but when it comes to actually making an investment that'll outperform the US markets, that becomes a little bit more of a murky question.  very, very difficult to us to look at European equity market growth and U.S. equity market growth, especially when we look at the focus of IT and financials here in the U.S. and believe that there's a lot of room for outperformance there in the developed international markets. Emerging markets, both on the debt and the equity side, do show some grain shoots and do show some very, very strong either  sovereign balance sheets or good positions for these corporations, but the path of tariffs will really, really make a difference. And so that makes it a little bit of a challenge for U.S. investors to go too deeply and go too far, either out-of-dollar investing or inter-international equities."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 601.372, "text": " House Republicans have declared the week ahead as crypto week, and I'm curious to get the take from the private wealth management perspective.

One is that these are certainly with us, and they're going to stay with us. I do believe that there are many of the cryptocurrencies themselves that are highly speculative,  And we are now starting to see a number of stable coins that are actually buying treasuries and basing them on treasury. And so one of the interesting things, interesting dynamics that we're seeing in the stable coin or the crypto assets is the purchase of treasuries.  Which is, if you had sort of thought about it initially or off the cuff, you would think that the crypto or emergence of more crypto options would actually be a move away from treasuries, when in fact the underlying securities and the underlying issuers are actually buying treasuries to make sure that they get that stability.  So I think that it's going to be a very, very interesting thing. Obviously, there's administration and on the Hill, there's support for crypto assets.

Rod, thank you so much for joining us. Rod Van Lipsy there, Managing Director, UBS Private Wealth Management on the line from Washington, D.C. here on the Daybreak Asia podcast.  Welcome back to the Daybreak Asia podcast. I'm Doug Krisner. So we know last Friday, President Trump declared a 30 percent tariff on goods from both the European Union and Mexico. They are effective August 1st, unless there is some sort of trade deal with both jurisdictions.  Over the weekend we heard from Ursula von der Leyen. She is the president of the European Commission and she said the EU will extend the suspension of trade countermeasures against the U.S. until August 1st and that in fact will allow for further trade talks. We also heard from Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum. She said that her team had already begun discussions with the U.S. on Friday.  Joining me now for a closer look at the tariff story is Mary Nicola, Bloomberg Markets Live strategist. Mary joins us from Singapore. It's always a pleasure to chat with you. I'm curious as to get your take on the tariff headwinds where you are and what's being said about whether President Trump may be bluffing."}, {"keywords": ["Tariffs", "Trade"], "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 779.869, "text": "Yeah, I think that  is very much the case, especially if you saw the way Asian equities had reacted last week. And it looked like they were shrugging off a lot of the noise that was coming through on tariffs. They shrugged off the noise on 50 percent on Brazil. Obviously, this morning, Japanese stocks are down. But actually, if you look at the Cosby in Korea, that's holding up quite well.  So there has been this disparity in terms of they're shrugging it off because doors are still open for negotiations. And I think that's key for markets. And also the fact that we could potentially see President Trump backpedaling. Also, the fact is that the data is holding up quite well. So I don't think you'll start seeing cracks  coming through into markets until we actually see some of the data come through fruition or the fact that you're seeing weakness coming through. And because we haven't seen that, it looks like the markets here in Asia are holding up relatively well."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 841.655, "text": " It's interesting, tonight here in the U.S., we had Trump saying that South Korea wants to make a trade deal. Now, that's coming from Mr. Trump's perspective. I'm not so sure that the same thing could be said for the South Korean side. Isn't it really difficult to kind of get a sense of where we are in the negotiating process?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 859.508, "text": " Yeah, it's interesting too, because if you look at Korea, the U.S. has a free trade agreement with Korea. So obviously the building blocks are solid and they're already there, but it's a matter of what more is the U.S. looking for. And I think that keeps coming up, especially in negotiations. So for example, with Japan, you've had a setback because of agriculture.  Agriculture is always a key sticking point when you're discussing trade negotiations and trade agreements, because obviously agriculture is considered some sort of national security issue as well. But for Korea specifically, it's interesting because you do have solid building blocks. You do have a free trade agreement. But of course, it's a matter of the 25 percent tariffs on cars. That's obviously a key sticking point.  for the Koreans and they want it to go away because obviously cars are a big part of what they're sending and what they're selling to the U.S. So unless those sectoral tariffs, which are still some of the bigger issues, go away, I think that might still hold Korea back and hold off an agreement between the two nations."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 931.058, "text": " So I'm curious, Mary, as to whether or not we have any data, high frequency or otherwise, that might give a little bit of insight into how this trade war is impacting not only Japan, but South Korea as well, economically. Do we know anything?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 945.284, "text": " Yeah, so so far, actually, if you look at some of the, so Korea, for example, releases export data 10 days, 20 days. And then also, if you look at the current account data, actually, all of them have been quite solid. So that's another key reason as to why the Asian Asian markets have been holding up relatively well.  Not to mention the fact that China as well has been holding up relatively well as well in addition to that. But if you look at some of the trade data coming out of Korea, there's no real indications that there has been a real slump, and that's really helping a lot of the markets. And I think as long as you see the strength in the current account, the strength in the external sector, that's going to keep equity markets, at least in the region, robust."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 993.833, "text": " So I know we get a couple of key data points for the Japanese economy this week, machine tool orders, industrial production. I think there is some inflation data in there as well. What are you going to be looking at?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 24, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1006.388, "text": " Yeah, I think the main thing for investors right now for the Japanese economy is on CPI. Obviously, there's a lot of concern about inflation. There's a lot of concern about it, because especially we're seeing yields rise. And there's this toxic mix for Japan, whether you're seeing it because of quantitative tightening, whether you're seeing it because of inflation.  whether you're seeing it because of worries about fiscal proficacy and especially with the elections coming through and the potential for more fiscal spending. So there is really the heightened focus is on CPI. Is CPI still high? And of course, we know that the Bank of Japan has been quite reluctant  to hike rates. So real rates remain quite high. And as a result, I think you're seeing investors just incredibly wary of especially Japanese bonds. That's also going to weigh on the yen in addition. So I think the focus for investors this week is going to be not only on CPI, but also on the elections."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 25, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1067.56, "text": " So is the BOJ in a little bit of a bind here?

And that's a really good question in terms of what do they do. And so far they've sent a message that, especially on the tightening side, that they're sitting on their hands. They're weighing what is happening externally. They're concerned more about the external challenges and the implications on the economy than inflation. And that has actually been to the detriment of the Japanese bond market and will likely hurt the yen as well.  But in the meantime, we are seeing quantitative tightening. And it's interesting to see the bond market reaction that despite the tweaks they've made. So, for example, the Ministry of Finance has already decided to reduce issuance in the back end. And we've seen some of those tweaks, yet we're still seeing pressure on bonds. So it's almost like they've let out their tools, but the tools aren't working. And that's just very much indicative of the bind that they're in.  And, of course, adding to that is just the potential of fiscal expansion, and that will just only add to the pressures on the bond market."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 27, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1147.278, "text": " So I know based on our history of conversations over the last several years, you pay very close attention to what the Fed is doing. And we've got President Trump and some of his allies who have been very critical of Fed Chair Jay Powell's handling of some of the renovations being done at the Fed headquarters. And a few people in the administration have been now building the case to remove Powell from the Fed's board of governors.  Were that to happen, it's probably a very extreme type scenario. What would the reaction do you think in Asian markets be under that scenario?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 28, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1183.968, "text": "Yeah, I think it's actually still a very dangerous game to play where you're where you're potentially cracking and ruining the credibility of the Fed.  And that's essentially what's been happening with all this pressure on the Fed. Where you do see is a potential reaction is that a move and a shift away from the dollar and that actually could be beneficial to a lot of the Asian currencies. We've seen the dollar slowly decline.  actually more than slowly declined since the start of this year. And I think that just precipitates it. And what you'll see is a switch over to a lot of the Asian currencies, for example, the CNY, the Korean won as well, where they're likely to get a bid as a result because of the fact that, you know, there is just this loss of credibility. Because if you do put someone  who is in that complies with what the fiscal policy and what the administration wants, that just risks where we could see inflation and how potential monetary policy just gets out of control. So I think in general what you'll see is just that shift continue away from the dollar as a result if you see further cracks in the Fed's credibility."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 29, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1260.087, "text": " Mary, we'll leave it there.
