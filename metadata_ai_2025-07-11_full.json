We have over $15 trillion announced already. And it's been \u2014 I mean, really, I would say it's been during the last three months. But we're here for a short period of time. And some administrations never had anywhere near that number for a whole term \u2014 probably for a whole two terms.  But we're up to over 15 trillion dollars coming into our country. There's never been anything like it anywhere in the world. There's never been an investment like that anywhere in the world. We, uh, look, I told this story and I just told it to Bibi backstage. I was talking to him and I said, you know, the king of Saudi Arabia, smart guy. And also we went to Qatar and we went to UAE.  really three strong leaders, smart guys. They all told me the same thing. And then I was reiterated at NATO just recently when we got back, where they agreed to spend a trillion dollars a year, by the way, which is about three times what they were spending. But they all said the same thing.  We thought your country was dead. Horrible term, right? We thought the United States of America was dead, and now you're presiding over the hottest country anywhere in the world. We're the hottest country in the world. I think Bibi would admit it. Even hotter than Israel, though Israel was pretty hot about a week ago, I can tell you, for the wrong \u2014 for the wrong reasons. But we are the hottest country in the world right now.  It happened faster than anybody thought possible. But we have over $15 trillion, and that means jobs, and that means building, and that means things like we've never seen before. So all we can do is keep working hard. There'll be always surprises. Some of the surprises are going to be bad surprises."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "China", "Export", "Import"], "line": 32, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1444.008, "text": " In your view, is the mortgage transfer all over?

It's an incredible victory, actually. It brought the greatest capabilities of the United States that are unmatched with the great capabilities of Israel.  and the Army of Israel, the pilots of Israel, the soldiers of Israel, and the Mossad. And the combination of these two extraordinary capacities produced a decisive result. It set back the two tumors that were threatening the life of Israel.  the nuclear tumor and the ballistic missile tumor, because they were planning to build 20,000 of these things and launch it in a country the size of New Jersey. And no country can withstand that. So what do you do when you have two things that are going to kill you? You have to remove them. With our combined effort, we did. But when you remove a tumor, it doesn't mean that it can't come back. You have to constantly monitor the situation to make sure that there's no attempt to bring it back.  So we've had a great achievement, and I think part of the effort of consolidating this and ensuring that we don't have to repeat this is to monitor this carefully. Of course, the President and I are talking about it. Our teams are talking about it. But there's no question, this is a historic victory. And I think, as was said here today, this has already changed the face of the Middle East. But I think that there is an opportunity here to create  a historic expansion of the Abraham Accords, which were themselves an act of history that deserve a Nobel Prize for the President.

They would never have had a chance without the sanctions. And one of the things we have with Iran is, you know, we have very \u2014 they call it biting \u2014 they are very biting sanctions. And I would love to be able to, at the right time, take those sanctions off, give them a chance at rebuilding.

We've made a deal \u2014 we're close to making a deal with India.  Others we've met with, and we don't think we're going to be able to make a deal, so we just send them a letter.

Great to see you. Thank you so much for being here. And so when the Democrats start screaming and yelling that this bill is going to kill people, they're referring to Medicaid. There were no actual cuts to Medicaid. The spending just slowed down a little bit.  The president has often said, if Medicaid isn't reformed in some way, there are people on it who are not entitled to the benefits. They're in this country illegally. There are people on it who are working and able-bodied. They don't need the benefit, yet somehow they're getting it. If we keep on this track, the whole system will implode. Yet they're going around and saying, people are going to die from this. It's factually false.  Yeah, Jackie, what you just explained is called a scam. Whenever you're getting money for something, you shouldn't be, when you are an able-bodied person, as you just explained, or someone who isn't entitled to those benefits, you shouldn't get those benefits. I thought it was pretty amazing to hear President Trump say, you know, the only thing the Democrats do well is complain. I would actually add something to that. The other thing they do well is lie, and they have lied extensively about this bill.  This is gonna make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Think about how impactful that will be for so many people. They were going to end, they were going to sunset, and then that would have been a huge tax increase for every single American. This strengthens our border, it strengthens our military, it makes it easier.  to do your taxes and incentivizes companies to come here into the United States and invest here in America for American workers. This is all great stuff for our country, but I think you continue to see the Democrats out there peddling lie after lie about this, because what is it that they're offering to the American people? Not a single Democrat voted for anything in this bill.  They all voted against it, and when the American people start to see the positive impact, as I asked President Trump there, when can we see it? He said, it's starting now, it's starting to happen now. They're gonna look even more foolish than they already do, because they are, every single day, working against the betterment of this country, and it's clearly to their own detriment. Just look at their polling as of late.  You know, but Laura, we both know that the Democrats lie and sometimes lies work. I mean, we've already seen the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee. They're up with their first ad buy of the season, the digital ad buy for the 2026 midterm cycle. And it's about what they call Medicaid cuts. And I know you just laid out how, you know, that's not factual. But will those lies work? Do you worry about the impact of that? Because Americans are very protective over their health care.  Yeah, well, they've lied time after time. And look at the way\u2014by the way, they lied about one person in particular so much. That's President Trump. I think he's probably the best weapon that we truly have as Republicans as we head into these 2026 midterms. Because you're right, Lisa, they're going to continue to peddle these lies. They're going to put ad after ad out. But think about how much they did that in the 2024 election.  Think about all the lies told about President Trump, all the lies, quite frankly, told about Kamala Harris to make her look better and look at the outcome of this election. All of the swing states, the popular vote, you know, historic landslide victory for President Trump. So I think it's up to us in the party to continue talking about the truth, to continue reminding people, hey, don't trust what the Democrats are telling you.  Trust how you feel. Do you feel safer in this country? Do you have more money in your pocket? Is your 401k going up? Do you have a better paying job? Those are all things that people are going to continue to see happen as time goes on and as this bill and everything that's in it actually takes hold here in America. So we're gonna have to keep talking about it and I think President Trump as well. He is our best weapon and he is the best, you know, he's the best salesperson for anything Republican that we have. Going forward, I'd say 26, 28 and probably beyond.  Yeah, nobody, on the Democrat side, they're not talking about the additions to defense spending, national security, the improvements at the border, all the things that are going to make us feel safer, which at this moment in time are so important. Absolutely.

Has the President told you, will we find out more about him? Does he want to know more about him? Why do you think we don't have more information at this point?  And that's sort of how I led into that question, actually, with him. I said, look, we all remember that there were congressional members who visited constantly in the weeks following that assassination attempt. That space there in Butler, we heard time after time, we're going to get to the bottom of it. But I think the American people are kind of still waiting to get to the bottom of it. I'm very encouraged to hear the fact  that hopefully we get this Senate report. I think that will maybe go quite a long ways with the American people. But, you know, to hear the president, and as I know him, my father-in-law, say that he's satisfied with the information he has, that does make me, as his daughter-in-law, feel better.

Because if you can't raise rents at least enough to meet the inflationary limits of 2%, which is apparently the Fed chair's limit,  developers aren't going to build.

We interviewed Kevin Warsh Monday. Tonight we interview National Economic Council Director, my good friend, Kevin Hassett. So that's pretty good. Both Kevins in one week. Kevin Hassett, we talked last night on the show.  and have talked a lot before, how the Federal Reserve System in the age of Trump, the Federal Reserve System should go through the same downsizing, the same transformations, the same perestroika that other federal agencies have gone through. And yet there's no sign of it.  And I think a new Fed chairman, whether it's you or Kevin Walsh or whoever it may be, it's incumbent on you to take a look at this, because so far it's the same old models that haven't worked for 50 years with a lot of dead wood, you know, let alone the fact that they should be cutting interest rates. The president had another Truth Social ad on it today. They should be cutting rates. But even larger point than that, where's the downsizing? Where's the reforming?  Where is the auditing of the Fed?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 76.653, "text": "Right. Well, I think that you're right, Larry. And the bottom line is that President Trump's objective is to take all of government and make it better and make it work better for the American people. And government has gotten very big throughout Washington. And one of the places that hasn't really responded yet to the downsizing that you're talking about is the Federal Reserve.  And I'm sure that whatever new leadership the president chooses for the new Federal Reserve, that they're going to pay close attention to the runaway spending, to the actual losses after years and years of profits, and so on. And with respect to interest rates, I think that everybody always understands that the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, but the president is allowed to speak his mind. But, also, you should look at the data.  And so one of the things, for example, you could do is look at what the European Central Bank has done with interest rates. And over time, those are highly, highly correlated with what happens here in the U.S. And so they've cut rates a lot. And if you were to take the rate cuts that they had and do the normal correlation for current Fed policy, then the current Federal Reserve rate would be about 3.  And so the president is wondering, why is it that the normal correlations seem to be breaking down right now, precisely while he's president? And I think that there's been an unfortunate pattern of perhaps not independent Federal Reserve taking actions where they, you know, cut right before the previous election, hiked right after he was elected last time.  And right now seem to be falling behind the curve compared to what other central banks are doing. I think that that raises the specter that they're not being nonpartisan, they're not being independent. And that's something that I'm sure the president is going to address in his next set of nominations."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 178.433, "text": " I mean, actually, surveys have shown from the Federal Election Committee that over 80 percent of the Fed staff donates to the Democratic Party. So there's another political point there. I really loved your point about Europe correlating Europe with the United States. The European Central Bank, I believe their overnight rate is now 2 percent. Ours is 4.5 percent. And yet our inflation rates are very similar here in the States.  Since January, for example, the CPI is 1.4% at an annual rate, something like that. So, right. Why are those interest rates deferentials? Someone's got to explain that. J-PAL never talks about that. He's too busy yapping about trade policy and tariffs and inflation, stuff he knows nothing about, and it's not the Fed's remit.  You know, Kevin here, look, the reason I want to see a thorough transformation, a thorough overhaul of the Fed, a house cleaning and a cleansing, if you will, is that these, you know, they are not an all-powerful central planning agency. They do not run the world, and their models are completely outdated. They've been outdated for almost 50 years, for heaven's sakes. Somebody's got to come in there and change all of that."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 254.489, "text": " Right. Well, the bottom line is that the Federal Reserve has made a lot of errors, policy errors in recent years, and they haven't really explained where the errors came from. And so what I would like to see in any agency, any government agency, and you remember when I was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, this was the highest priority as you worked with me in the White House, is that when we said something's going to be 3 percent,  We put out the model that explains why we think it's going to be 3%. If we get the number wrong, we explain what was wrong with our model. We reevaluate our models over time. And so one of the things that I find disappointing is that the Federal Reserve has been, as you say, yapping, but they've been talking on and on about the impact of tariffs on inflation, and yet they've not published a model that shows, like, what is the impact that they're concerned about.  that is causing interest rates to be, like, highly, you know, different from what they normally would be, given where interest rates around the world are. And so I think it's incumbent on anybody in government, if they've got strong policy positions, to explain where those positions come from and to, when they, you know, have things happen, like inflation get out of control, explain what they got wrong and why. And I think that the absence of transparency at the Fed is something that the president is highly valuing as he's thinking about what his next step should be."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 332.519, "text": " You know, I'm very concerned.

The large staff is very hostile to Mr. Trump's ideas.  very hostile to supply-side economics, for example, or growth economics. I mean, they're always targeting the same 1.8 percent that the Congressional Budget Office is targeting. Something's got to be done. Someone's got to do an audit of the Fed staff, who they are, what they're promoting, and, as you say, why their models aren't more transparent. The other thing I want to ask you about, you've got these district reserve banks, again,  Many of them, most of them if I'm not mistaken, have been appointed by Democratic presidents, Obama and Biden, and I think their biases are very much against President Trump and his program. I don't want to overstate it. I'm not here to make an audit of every Reserve Bank president, but they are appointed, however,  with the consent of the President of the United States. There is a process that goes through there. And, of course, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. So here, too, is another avenue nobody looks at. Who are these folks? What are their staffs like? What kind of models do they produce? Et cetera, et cetera.

And at the time, President Clinton was in the White House, and he proposed a BTU tax. Do you remember that? And then I got to noodling about a BTU tax, and I wrote an academic paper about how to think about a BTU tax, which was ultimately published in a peer-reviewed journal. Alan Greenspan wouldn't let the Fed publish the paper.  He wouldn't let the Fed publish the paper until all the legislative action on the BTU tax had been completed, because he didn't want the Fed to stick its nose into fiscal policy. He didn't want the Fed to look like it was intervening in the thinking of Washington.

So you don't need this large  you know, brand-new building in Maryland for FBI headquarters. I think his approach is very wise. Use taxpayer dollars in a more efficient way. Use an existing building that had been used for USAID, the Ronald Reagan building right there in D.C. Move FBI headquarters there. You don't need this new elaborate building in Maryland.

Provider tax is nothing more than a way for states to take more federal dollars without matching state dollars towards Medicaid. And so we are reducing the provider tax rate from 6% to 3.5. It won't start until 2028. And New York, for instance, won't be affected until 2031.  because New York is at 4.7%. The state-directed payments were changed under the Biden administration to allow Medicaid reimbursements to be paid out at private insurance rates, exploding the cost of the program. And so what we're saying is it should go back to what it was just two years ago, a one-to-one match with Medicare reimbursements, and therefore it is at parity.  That is going to take effect starting in 28 and go down 10% per year until it is back at parity. That is not a huge change. That is something that is common sense to make sure that these programs are available for the people who need them and that the funding is there to support our seniors, our IDD community, children, single mothers, et cetera."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 392.172, "text": " Now that you have had this big success, the Republicans getting this across the finish line, what does the legislative agenda look like for the rest of the year?

It certainly will give the president greater leverage in negotiations on trade, but also in how we conduct operations in the Indo-Pacific. You have seen, no question, China has made advancements in the Indo-Pacific and the South China Sea.  They've used economic coercion to seize control of ports and waterways. 60% of international trade comes through the Strait of Taiwan. We do not want a situation where China invades Taiwan or creates a blockade. So a weakened Xi Jinping is good news. Obviously, we see Vladimir Putin continuing to rear his ugly head.

The Trump mandate that the American people voted for last November also includes unleashing energy dominance, permitting reform,  Advancing cooperative federalism, making America the AI capital of the world, bringing back, protecting American auto jobs. EPA has a lot that we could do on all these fronts in order to both protect the environment and grow the economy. While we're at it, that means that we will have more deregulation in one agency.  Then, the entire federal governments across all agencies, across entire presidencies, when you look back in history, that's how much of a mess it was that we inherited from the Biden administration with all of their rules and regulations, seeking to strangulate entire industries with new rules in 2023 and 2024."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 166.098, "text": " And you've been able to really cut a lot of that out, right, Lee?

Unqualified recipients, reduced agency oversight, those grants are canceled. Right now, the plaintiffs, the recipients, are now litigants. So we're in court in the D.C.

The problem is, is that what the plaintiffs have been doing across this country with different cases is that they seek out activist judges at the district court level, instead of going to the court of federal claims.

Hello, my name is Larry Arnn. I'm the president of Hillsdale College, which is honored to be working with the White House to produce these videos in honor of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the greatest political document in human history.  Our college was founded in honor of that document. We encourage you to love it and to celebrate it. And to celebrate it, you should learn about it. We're going to talk about two things, the meaning and the structure of the Declaration of Independence. First question is, what does it mean? Things have causes. There's a classical account of the causes of things that include four. The efficient cause means whoever made it. The material cause means whatever it's made out of.  The formal cause means, what does it look like and how does it operate? And the final cause is, what is it for? What love produces it? Declaration of Independence contains a lot of information about the formal cause of America in the middle, but its chief function is to provide the final cause of the country.  What is the country for? And it begins very beautifully by explaining that. It says that any time in history, any people in history have a right under the laws of nature and of nature's God to form a nation according to purposes that they adopt. What are these laws of nature and nature's God? What does that mean?  The Christian view is that God made nature. The classical view is that each being has a good, and the good and the being are the same thing. Nature is full of things that are good, and it's wrong to violate the good of anything. What do these laws say about people? They say that they're all created equal. Think what a remarkable thing it is for a people to adopt a standard like that.  as their purpose, as their governing purpose. And we did that in opposition to a king who claimed that he was born to be our ruler, because he was better born than we are. He was denying the proposition that all men are created equal. If you recognize this principle of equality and you recognize it properly, it will give rise to the most amazing diversity and difference among people.  because it sets up a right of all of us to pursue our lives best we can. Without impediment by kings and emperors, we said, in the laws of nature and nature's God, no one is born to rule anybody else.  And that's beautiful. And it sets up an agitation in the country, which goes on to this day, to always try to recognize those principles. And that's the final cause of the United States of America. Now we're at about the structure of the document. It begins with this universal claim that we're all created equal and that nobody may rule us except by our consent.  And in the middle bit, they claim the king has done a bunch of bad stuff that justifies the revolution. He took houses away from people and put troops in them. That means they were dislodged. They were driven out into the street. He arrested people. He put them on ships. And the ships were not very comfortable. They were in the hold of the ship. Sometimes they sat around for weeks in the harbor.  And they were taken all the way to England. Most of them had never been there before. And they were put on trial in front of people who they never met before. Not a jury of your peers. This is the 25th paragraph. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coast, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He did kill people. And then he'd talk about the mercenaries there. Large armies of foreign mercenaries. Those were the Hessians.  to complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely parallel in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation.\" But then that leads us to the second thing about this structure point.  And that was, some of them are direct violations of the best method. The founders argued the only sure method to keep the government from doing things like that to you, to its citizens, to anybody, right?  And those methods are, they provide the organizing principle of the Constitution of the United States. They are representation. You know, the Continental Congress that passed the Declaration of Independence took great pains to be a representative body. That is to say, they're not acting according to their own wills. Somebody else, those who will be governed under this new government that they're creating,  have appointed us to do this. We are acting for them. We have government by consent. And they say that the king is interfering with the legislatures that they had had before. He dissolved several of them, and he prevented others of them from meeting. And those are all in these charges here, right? He has obstructed government by consent. Then he's messed around with the judicial branch. And that means that the legislature has to  pass a law, and then the executive enforces only the laws that have been passed, and then when the law is applied upon any citizen, he has to be taken in front of a judge who's not dismissible by the legislature or the executive, and then the judge has to decide. That's called the independent judiciary. It's a terribly important thing.  So the middle bit of the Declaration, these 28 paragraphs, is the second part of the structure of the Declaration of Independence. And the third part is a formal legislative act that makes the nation.  passed by the Continental Congress. I should mention that God appears four times in the Declaration of Independence. He appears in the first sentence as the maker of the laws of nature and nature's God, the legislator. He appears in the beginning of the second paragraph as the endower of our rights as creators.  the founder of everything. The last paragraph is personal. They refer to themselves for the first time. We, therefore, the representatives of the United States, the representatives of the United States, we, in general, Congress assembled. And then they appeal to somebody to judge whether they're right. And that person is not the king of England. It's the supreme judge of the world, the judicial branch.  for the rectitude of our intentions. In other words, we swear we're doing what seems right and we ask God to judge. In the name of the good people of these colonies, you can read it as a claim that the people of the colonies are good, you can read it as a claim that we're acting for the good ones, or you can read it as the claim  We have to remember to be good, because we are assuming this authority now. Free and independent states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved, and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war. Now we get to the hard thing.  conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And then the beautiful last sentence. This is where the executive branch comes in. Because, see, now it's war.  and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence. That's God as the executive branch. We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. Only in the hands of God would all the powers of government be combined.  Those men in that room, the same room where the Constitution would later be written by some of the same people, we mutually pledge to each other everything we've got. We Americans today owe those people. We should learn about them.

It taught me about what it means to be selfless, what it means to fight alongside your fellow Americans for them, to be laser focused on a mission, and it's the greatest thing I could have done with that period of time in my life where I could be doing a lot of other things.  In every generation, you have to ask yourself the question, if not me, then who's it going to be? If not this generation, then what? We're passing the buck to the next generation. And so my challenge to this generation is, are you ready to step up? Vote. Are you ready to take the lead? Because generations before you, all the way back to the revolution, stood up for a principle, stood up for country, stood up for freedom, stood up against tyranny. And then they didn't just talk about it.  Soldiers and warriors and others step up and grab a rifle. They should actually do something about it. They say, you have to come through me if you want to take our freedom. You have to come through me. They did it then, and they've done it in every successive generation. And are you able to step up to that task? Do you understand a purpose-driven life? Do you understand principles larger than yourself, that our rights are endowed by a creator from government? You don't have freedom without those willing to defend it.  Part of the reason you should serve today is that we're getting back to basics. And one of those basics is the warrior ethos. We're not doing the politically correct, social justice, ideological stuff that previous administrations did. This is the back to basics of readiness, of accountability, of standards, of lethality, and of war fighting. With President Trump at the helm, we're gonna have your back.  We will have your back when we ask you to do difficult things. You will be equipped with the best equipment in the world. You will be given a clear and narrow mission that's focused on our country and our country's interests. To be strong, to be tough, to be selfless, to be courageous, to be determined. Those are principles of the warrior ethos. To finish the fight.  We need that instilled in the veins of our warrior class of Americans who are willing to do really tough, really difficult things, and not because they're going to get a medal for it or they're going to be famous because of it, but it's because of the integrity and honor and duty that they have inside them that makes them a warrior. You see, the world looked at Joe Biden and felt like they could take advantage of America.  We were chumps. We were weak. We were woke. We were focused on other things.

It taught me about what it means to be selfless.  what it means to fight alongside your fellow Americans for them, to be laser focused on a mission. And it's the greatest thing I could have done with that period of time in my life where I could be doing a lot of other things. In every generation, you have to ask yourself the question, if not me, then who's it going to be? If not this generation, then we're passing the buck to the next generation. And so my challenge to this generation is, are you ready to step up?  Are you ready to take the lead? Because generations before you, all the way back to the revolution, stood up for a principle, stood up for country, stood up for freedom, stood up against tyranny. And then they didn't just talk about it. Soldiers and warriors and others step up and grab a rifle and actually do something about it. They say, you have to come through me if you want to take our freedom. You have to come through me.  They did it then, and they've done it in every successive generation, and are you able to step up to that task? Do you understand the purpose driven life? Do you understand principles larger than yourself, that our rights are endowed by a creator, not from government? You don't have freedom without those willing to defend it.  Part of the reason you should serve today is that we're getting back to basics. And one of those basics is the warrior ethos. We're not doing the politically correct, social justice, ideological stuff that previous administrations did. This is the back to basics of readiness, of accountability, of standards, of lethality, and of war fighting. With President Trump at the helm,  we're going to have your back. We will have your back when we ask you to do difficult things. You will be equipped with the best equipment in the world. You will be given a clear and narrow mission that's focused on our country and our country's interests. To be strong, to be tough, to be selfless, to be courageous, to be determined. Those are principles of the warrior ethos. To finish the fight.  We need that instilled in the veins of our warrior class of Americans who are willing to do really tough, really difficult things, and not because they're going to get a medal for it or they're going to be famous because of it, but it's because of the integrity and honor and duty that they have inside them that makes them a warrior.

To be a member of a class action, it's sort of a lengthy process where a judge has to determine that  There is a class that all the class has similar interests and other things like that. So, presumably, that's being done, and that's why he's doing this. But I think he might have been able to thread that needle, or he tried to. But I think one of the important points is, this will all become moot probably after the October argument, where the Supreme Court is going to actually weigh in on the merits of the birthright citizenship issue.  And there's a couple of ways it could go. It could go with Donald Trump entirely. It could go entirely against him. But there could be a middle ground where it says it's the role of Congress to determine what does it mean to be within the jurisdiction of the United States, because that's a core issue here. It's not just being born here. It's being born and being under the jurisdiction of the United States.

In Buffalo, an individual named Matthew White posts on X, kill them all. The ICE is the new Gestapo stop, then he is facing federal charges for threatening ICE agents. Let's go to  Fourth of July, the Alvarado assault that we were talking about, Lisa was pointing out, they had AR-style rifles, they had body armor, they had two-way radios, they had Faraday bags that was trying to conceal cell phone, coordinated  planned premeditated attack, and of the 10 individuals now facing first-degree attempted murder of federal immigration officers, there is an 11th individual, Benjamin Song, on the run, allegedly provided those weapons to the 10 protesters. Then let's go down to McAllen, Texas. An absolute barrage of bullets from an assailant on a Border Patrol annex facility in McAllen, Texas, that housed a Special Operations Division  of border patrol, that individual deceased, but it's causing all BP facilities in Texas to get heightened security. Let's go to Tuesday, July 8th, the next day. That's when, as you're mentioning, Lisa, the Democrats, led by Cory Booker and Senator Padilla, wanting to unmask agents, while the agents, ICE, federal law enforcement, has said that they are wearing  identification of ICE and HSI on them, but they're covering their faces because there are individuals trying to publicly dox these agents, putting them, their families, their spouses, their children at heightened risk. Same day, you've got four arrested out in Van Nuys, California, for placing allegedly tire spikes in the road, puncturing the holes of ICE vehicles, trying to stop that raid.  By the way, that raid, a legal raid being carried out by Warren, and the same day you've got up in San Francisco agitators confronting ICE outside of immigration court. We have seen that in sanctuary cities like San Francisco, where the authorities will not turn over criminal, illegal aliens,  that have deportation orders. They just turn them loose on the streets. ICE trying to pick them up, but they're getting resistance and being assaulted there. And then finally, as we've been talking out in Camarillo, California, the unbelievable, there's a $50,000 reward. The U.S. attorney out there, Bill Isolay, saying that they want to capture that individual that appeared to fire  a weapon, fire a pistol at ICE agents who are carrying out a lawful warrant.

We've heard the Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick say that  He and the governor, Greg Abbott, want to put in a network of flood sirens through the Guadalupe River Valley, much the same as the tornado sirens that we see so prevalent across the Midwest that are very, very effective in telling people, hey, it's time to get out of harm's way, go to your storm cellar or go to your tornado shelter, whatever you've got on your property.

So there's a lot of eyeballs on this case, and here's why. It has huge implications for ICE enforcement and Border Patrol enforcement of immigration law here in Los Angeles. What's happening is,  The Trump administration is being sued by the ACLU and a handful of plaintiffs who say that some of the arrests they have been making here in Los Angeles, particularly those mass arrests we're seeing at Home Depots and car washes and farms, they allege those arrests are based off only skin color and racial identity. And that is the only basis for which the federal government is arresting people, essentially only arresting people who have brown skin and are speaking Spanish.  The DOJ and the Trump administration have countered, saying that is not the case. Their arrests have followed the law. And they use a bunch of different tactics, a bunch of totality of circumstances when making arrests. That includes location, intelligence, surveillance, and a variety of other factors.  The plaintiffs in this case are asking the judge, who is a Biden appointee, to block the Trump administration from carrying out what they call a, quote, deportation dragnet. In other words, they want them to stop showing up to Home Depots and car washes and just scooping up anybody who they feel looks like a potential illegal immigrant to them. The DHS and the Trump administration, again, have countered that that is not what they're doing.  The arguments have just started in the courtroom behind us right now. The plaintiffs in this case are five people who say they were detained by the federal government. They've been joined by the ACLU, the City of Los Angeles, activist groups, and other cities and municipalities.

So one of the main things that failed there, clearly the communications, the Secret Service did not have  sort of a unified communication system. The radio comms were dated. When I was an agent, the Secret Service had sort of an antiquated radio system. They've since changed that, and they're in the process of changing that. And one of the other things that failed was the advance team. Clearly, the advance agent  did not make specific responsibilities to the local police of who was responsible for what. So, in my opinion, Will, it was really the radio communications and the advance agent not making clear areas of responsibility. And let me just touch on something you said there, Will, that was in the lead up here that, you know,  Every single event that I went to as a Secret Service agent, every single one, there was reports of a suspicious person, a person with a gun, a person sometimes with a bomb, somebody who was acting strangely. Every single event I went to had that. And the Secret Service has to take what is called a measured response to that. So if every single event this is happening, and every single event there's reports of a suspicious person, the Secret Service cannot go rush the president  or, in this case, a presidential candidate off the stage, it would just be embarrassing for the president or that candidate. So the service has to take what's called a measured response. You have to investigate that. And that's clearly what was going on in Butler. They were getting reports of the suspicious person.

Federal prosecutors say the alleged gunman purchased four of the guns that were found in connection with the shootings.  at those or of those agents. Two of those AR-style rifles, we are told, were found at the scene. One of them had a binary trigger, which we understand is the ability to have a more rapid fire. It is quicker than a standard semi-automatic rifle. This all comes as anti-ICE activists become increasingly violent, spiking assaults on Border Patrol agents across America.  You're watching Outnumbered. I'm Harris Faulkner here with my co-host Emily Campagno. Also joining us today, Kennedy, host of the Kennedy Saves the World podcast, Lisa Booth, Fox News political analyst, and Jeremy Hunt, veterans on duty chairman and former Army intelligence captain. Federal immigration officers have been in the crosshairs of violent attacks, literally, since anti-ICE rhetoric ramped up. And it has been. It's just gotten so much worse in, say, the last month or so.  In recent days, federal officers faced two separate ambushes in Texas. 12 suspects now face serious charges in that Alvarado, Texas ambush I was just mentioning previously. 11 of them are facing attempted murder. Take a look at this. In San Francisco, it's an anti-ICE protest that eventually devolved into a full-blown assault on federal agents, shoving, punching,  And they are all wearing masks. The brutal altercation led to the blocking of traffic. Video here showing this black SUV in the middle of all the chaos. The driver, presumably fed up, drove through that violent crowd as one of the protesters was hanging on to the van's front hood.  And there's a new Democrat proposal now that would dox federal immigration officers, stripping them of their face masks during those field operations, identifying the law enforcement who are already being targeted and their families.

They couldn't wear their uniforms in public because a lot of people had a hard time separating their issues with the political issue of the war in Vietnam with the soldier.  I think it's very similar to what we're seeing here. I mean, people who, these are ICE agents who put their lives on the line and care about our country, who are just doing their jobs, and now because of people, these extremists, who hate Donald Trump and hate what those of us who care about strong borders stand for, they hate that so much that they're willing to attack the agents themselves.

I mean, if you're talking about the politicians and places... I was talking about the crazy people who they're looking for in the manhunts. But you make a good point. It's hard sometimes to tell the difference in how they express themselves.  No, it really does feel like even though, and we have seen this in Congress when Democrats and Republicans go in for security briefings, you know, Democrats in private will say, you know, I really support our troops. I support federal law enforcement. But then they come out and they virtue signal and talk about passing bills like this. And unfortunately, you know, for these unsophisticated, stinky Antifa protesters who want to do as much harm as they possibly can to law enforcement,  They're not going to differentiate between FBI, U.S. Marshals, HSI agents and ICE agents. They just want to do as much harm as they possibly can to law enforcement, federal or otherwise. And, you know, these lawmakers who are charged with putting forth legislation that betters the country, they're putting them at risk.  And so my challenge is, if you have a problem with ice and, you know, if it's an institutional problem, then write some legislation and get some of your colleagues on the other side to co-sign it with you to make it better. But this is only raising the temperature. And, you know, now we're just going to fixate on one issue, and that's face masks. And it really lets us take our eye off of the larger picture.

This after the company came out yesterday and boosted its net revenue forecast for the full year. A big question a lot of investors had was,  what has been and what will be the impact on the company from tariffs. Harmeet Singh, the company's CFO and chief growth officer, he told our Bloomberg News team that'll be about $25 to $30 million through the end of the year. We actually had him on our program a few hours ago.  And I asked him specifically about moving production, moving manufacturing to the United States, because that is exactly what the president wants to see. It doesn't matter if it's in Vietnam or China or Indonesia or where it is. The president wants to see it here in the US. He was decidedly firm in his answer that is not going to happen for Levi Strauss. He mentioned that 98% of apparel that comes to the United States and that is sold in the United States is actually manufactured outside of the US.  They're not going to change that here when it comes to Levi Strauss, though. He's still working through tariffs and even making last minute changes based on the news that he hears from the president, even up to late last night after earnings, he mentioned. Also, performance food group shares surged higher today.  Bloomberg News reported that the company has attracted takeover interest from U.S. Foods Holding Corp. It's a potential deal that would create a food distribution company with a combined sales of roughly $100 billion. This is according to people familiar with the matter. Shares higher by more than 4.8 percent today.  The company would become the number one U.S. food service distributor with 18% of the $371 billion market. This is according to Bloomberg Intelligence. We should note there is no certainty that these deliberations will lead to transactions, and representatives for U.S. Foods and Performance Food declined to comment.  And finally, this is a former micro-cap that is now a small cap after today's move of close to 40 percent, Unusual Machines.

Zahra Hirji covers climate for Bloomberg, and she spends a lot of time thinking about how our understanding of risk is currently evolving in a warming world. So Texas is actually a state that has a ton of resources. It has one of the best emergency response offices and teams and capabilities in the country. Most states are not like Texas.  Zara says Texas is the gold standard when it comes to its emergency response capabilities, but it also faces a wide variety of disaster risks, from hurricanes to extreme heat. And even if it has a lot of money to spend on disaster response, it faces difficult choices about how to spend it.  And on the ground, localities face their own budgetary trade-offs. We know, for example, that Kerr County considered installing a warning system that could have involved sirens in high-risk areas. But it didn't. We've heard from officials in Texas that one of the reasons why they had not built a flood detection warning system in this area, say in Kerr County, where some of the worst flooding was,  is because of the cost, right? So it was Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly who told the New York Times that local residents whose taxes wound up to fund such a system balked at it. How much does it cost to develop a really effective early warning system for these emergencies? I think it depends on the community and the type of warning and the type of area that you're trying to cover.  But obviously it's an expense and every local government and state government has a lot of things on their plate and I'll say mitigation often falls to the bottom of that."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 399.412, "text": " \u2014 There are traditionally federal grant programs that communities or individuals can apply for."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 405.058, "text": "\u2014 Joshua Sachs again."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 406.62, "text": "\u2014 Like putting their homes higher up, or elevating their homes, or elevating air conditioners, water heaters, things like that.

One of the main tools that communities in the U.S. have to understand their flood risk are maps made by FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In 2019, FEMA estimated that over 8 million properties are at risk for severe flooding from what's known as a once-in-a-hundred flooding event.  My colleague Zahra Hirji says those maps are used for everything from emergency planning to calculating flood insurance premiums for millions of people all across the country. But calculating the true level of risk out there is complicated. One of the things that's changing with climate change is places that haven't even flooded historically. Like places in Kentucky have experienced flooding that they never even thought was possible. And so, you know, you're having more places effectively become like Kerr County.  Updating these maps to match our evolving climate is possible, but it takes investment in technology and research. Some private companies, like Firststreet, which does climate risk financial modeling, have more up-to-date flood maps. In 2020, Firststreet released a report identifying nearly 6 million additional properties nationwide that were at the level of risk that FEMA considers severe.

That's the program Zara was talking about earlier. Congress created the Federal Flood Insurance Program in 1968, basically because the private insurance for flood risk failed. And private insurers pulled out of that hazard. They said, we're not going to cover this anymore.  because they didn't feel like they could price policies affordably enough for most of the homeowners who are in that area of risk. And we've seen federal flood insurance rates go up because it turns out the risk is really high. And one of the problems is there have been so much flooding, and so they've had to make so many payouts, that they've run out of money. And they keep having to go to Congress and say, we need more money.  So it's not a sustainable program and you could sort of understand how and why the insurance market got out of it. There are ways to reduce those risks, which brings us back to mitigation. Zara says research shows spending more upfront money on mitigation turns out to be significantly cheaper in the long run.  In 2019, there was a report that was partially funded by FEMA and the federal government looking specifically at mitigation. It was called the Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves 2019 Report. And it had found that every $1 in federal grant money spent on hazard mitigation saves $6 in disaster damages in the future. The cost of cleaning up a disaster like the flooding in Central Texas can be staggering.  A preliminary estimate from AccuWeather, Inc. puts the total damage and economic loss from the floods in Texas in a range of $18 billion to $22 billion. And more than that, the return on investment is even higher for federal grant spending on riverine flooding mitigation. So I'm talking about the mitigation that would specifically go towards helping or preventing the type of event we saw in Texas.  And so in that case, by granting $11.5 billion to help states build up river defenses between 1993 to 2016, the federal government and society at large avoided $82 billion  in losses from deaths, from likely flooded damage, from business disruptions associated with the flood. So as the study author, one of the study authors of that report told me, mitigation or preparedness saves lives. And he didn't say this, but what's clear is it also very much saves money.

So with some colleagues, we put out a report not so long ago.  where we think that it's more than likely that as a result of this immigration policy, we will have negative net migration, which is to say more people leaving the country than entering the country this year for the first time in many decades.

So I appreciate that the published statistics are showing things about share of foreign-born and the like.  Those statistics, while I don't mean to impugn them at all, these are large changes that are happening right now and those statistics are probably not fully catching up with what's happening. My guess, my analysis suggests that the surge in immigration over the past few years is actually still pushing up labor supply.  And the reason I say that is because there's a big swath of immigrants that are new to this country that are eligible to apply for work permits. And we have seen a surge in those work permit applications. And while approval rates are down, like, for example, between April and May, this administration approved almost 700,000 work permits for recent immigrants.  And so I think one of the reasons that we've seen such strong employment numbers over the past few months, on average 150,000, I think that that is because labor supply is still being pushed up by the recent surge in immigration, but we can't ride that wave forever, and we're probably just about at the moment that that increase in labor supply comes to an end, and we start seeing payroll employment numbers that are closer to like  30,000 a month, 10,000 a month in a year or so we could start seeing payroll employment numbers that are negative and that will be like a healthy, sustainable, full employment labor market just with declining labor supply and so declining employment. So what does that mean for participation and the unemployment rate?  So there's going to be some near-term gyrations. A year from now, though, to your point, if we're in a negative growth on payrolls, what's the rest of the job market look like? So I think the rest of the \u2013 this is going to be the cognitive dissonance, the thing that's going to be really hard about understanding the labor market that this policy has created.  It could well be that we have a healthy labor market, an unemployment rate that starts with a four. Starts with a four? Starts with a four. It could be a nice, healthy labor market, but we have a shrinking labor supply, and that just means shrinking employment. There are other economies. Are wages through the roof in that world?  For a time, I think that there will be near-term gyrations. We're going to see stronger wage growth in some occupations, stronger wage growth in the agricultural sector, stronger wage growth for home health workers. But I think other parts of the economy,  And particularly some cities, some areas are actually going to see big reductions in consumer demand. We're already seeing this in some areas where we're seeing big raids on immigrant communities. And businesses there are complaining that they're seeing much less demand for their products.  those businesses are going to lower their prices, they're going to lay off workers, and you're going to have deflationary effects."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 26, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1108.873, "text": "I want to focus on the labor supply issue you're referring to, because we know there are people on the sidelines in this. That's why we don't have a full labor market participation. The Ag Secretary, Brooke Rollins, suggested in an interview this week that if you take the agricultural sector, for example, and the workforce that may be lost by migrants, that there are people who could replace those workers, people who need to work in order to be eligible  for Medicaid, do you expect that that actually is a dynamic that will take place, that that kind of changes to how you're able to access Medicaid could bring people off the sidelines?

I don't know that it will happen nearly enough to replace the hundreds of thousands of immigrants that we're talking about no longer being in this country or not coming.  And I'll also say one of the reasons why I'm skeptical that this will be a huge effect is that the labor market has been quite strong for some time. And it has been a pretty good time to get a job. And we've seen stronger labor force participation among some groups, but those groups have actually largely been women.  who have increased their labor force participation rates. There's some excellent work coming out of the Hamilton Project at Brookings showing that labor force participation among women has been particularly strong. Even this strong labor market has not been enough to get these prime age men off the sidelines. So I'm not sure that incrementally stronger wage growth is going to have some cataclysmic effect.

Everybody's all excited about Superman, right? The Dog Crypto, the latest take on this iconic brand. Yeah, DC Comics, but a different wrinkle now. James Gunn, the Marvel guy, is making it. It's supposed to be a more up-to-date, inspiring, optimistic take on the old tale. Guys like me who grew up with Christopher Reeves are supposed to love this stuff. As you can see on YouTube, the White House  Well, I guess has its own version of Superman. Donald Trump in the full outfit, as you can see, taking off into the heavens. I'm gonna sort of walk you back here a little bit because James Gunn's been doing a lot of press. As I read in what is the best story on the terminal today by the great Jason Bailey, the headline, Superman immigrant backlash is comically misguided. James Gunn said a couple of things.  in some of the media interviews he's been doing. Superman, he said, is the story of America. He told the London Times, quote, an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, unquote. Populated the country. This has created this big woke backlash against the Superman movie because, well, nothing is simple anymore. Big expose on Fox News. It's set social media on fire.  from the far right rage machine in Jason's words. Hence the post on social media today from the White House. We see that again. President Trump as Superman, look at him taking off. He doesn't like dogs though, so I guess there's no crypto. Of course, Donald Trump has a history of this. He's been dressing up as a lot of different things in social media. Remember when he showed up as Rocky just a couple of years ago? Well, that was 2019.  Looks pretty good with the belt, I have to admit. But as Jason Bailey writes, the idea that Superman is a previously apolitical character who has been co-opted by the political left for cultural indoctrination is comically ignorant. You know the guys who started this? Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, both children of Jewish immigrants.  And before we even entered World War II, they had a two-page story of Look Magazine called How Superman Would End the War, in which he literally takes Adolf Hitler by the throat. There was later a radio show, Adventures of Superman. A 16-episode arc called Clan of the Fiery Cross, in which Superman took on the KKK.  So Jason makes the point that there's not a lot new here, and I'm really glad that he's with us. Bloomberg Opinion guest columnist, he's a film critic and historian and author of the book, Gandolfini, Jim, Tony, and the Life of a Legend. Jason, I can tell I like you already, and I appreciate your coming to talk to me here on Bloomberg. Are you surprised to see the woke backlash? This is speaking for not really Superman, but the political climate we're in here, right?  Right. I mean, you kind of put your finger on it earlier. You know, nothing is simple anymore. Nothing is what it appears, what its intentions may or may not be. Everything is up for sort of a deep read that's usually comprised of a kind of bad faith. And, you know, I knew  Earlier this year, I actually wrote a different Bloomberg editorial about this, that when Snow White, the Snow White remake tanked, and suddenly people were eagerly ascribing it to, you know, to making it an Israel and Palestine issue, I was like, oh, we really sort of crossed the Rubicon here.  So I'm unsurprised, I'm especially not surprised, you know, these debates run rampant throughout popular culture, but especially in the sort of superhero movie world.  which speaks first, you know, to their cultural ubiquity. Like these really are typically the biggest blockbusters, the movies that everyone sees and thus has an opinion on. Um, but they are also typically loaded, um, for these kinds of readings for a lot of the reasons that we're seeing with the Superman controversy.  So you're a, you're a film critic. You understand the business of Hollywood and you don't see him in your column to feel that this is going to hurt box office receipts for this movie. So are people just talking out of their hats and then going to see the movie? How does that come together?  I mean, I think it's very easy to sort of overestimate the effect that a small number of extremely loud voices can have. And the way that I put it in the column was that, you know, these takes  the likes of which we're seeing on Fox News and Daily Wire and places like that, they generate clicks. They generate the enthusiasm of that audience that goes to those outlets. But those probably aren't the audience for these things anyway. The best sort of example that I've found was recalling the hullabaloo from a lot of the same people over Barbie a couple of years back.  And the sort of the what were in that case much more explicitly stated themes of feminism and diversity and that sort of thing and You know people like Ben Shapiro or say nobody's gonna go see this movie and then it literally breaks box-office records  You know and then someone posted today someone found a clip of him the like the weekend after Barbie came out Saying well, you're gonna see a second weekend drop-off on this like no one's ever seen and like there was no second weekend drop-off It's just you know, it's  It's somewhat performative. I'm sure that in their heart of hearts, these people are genuinely angry that every single work of popular art doesn't speak specifically to them. But a lot of it is generating traffic, generating rage clicks, generating advertiser dollars.  Oh, it's exhausting. Rage click. It's exhausting. Got a life. These are the same people who are going to go see the movie. That's the best part. Jason, uh, really appreciate Jason Bailey is a film critic whose work has appeared as well in the New York times vulture playlist slate and the rolling stone. How did we find you at Bloomberg?

Our Bloomberg News team was the first to report that Vietnam's leadership was caught off guard by the president's announcement of a 20% tariff.

Our colleagues there are saying that this deal, or if we're calling it that, this announcement of the president, the U.S. president, has not been amplified by Vietnamese state media particularly heavily.  So it remains a little bit unclear. Now remember this is the only deal with one of the countries that was facing a potential tariff hike this week about the nearly five dozen countries. He also has sort of a framework deal with the U.K. itself had some questions.  And of course, they've got that deal with China to essentially keep talking. So the deals just really aren't materializing. Now, Trump himself has said he's not particularly stressed about that because he simply wants to set unilateral rates anyway. So whether he'll do that or not, we will see. But there have been a lot of developments here on trade this week in the past 48 hours or so.

So they were sort of a test case. Hey, how are you going to deal with this? And what Trump announced was essentially a double tariff for transshipped goods and this 20% rate for all other goods.  you know, there's still some questions swirling about that, including whether, you know, it would include the sort of role in previous tariffs or not. And Secretary Besant was asked about that earlier this week. But it really does look like it's, let's say, more fluid than not. And so that, of course, hangs in the air as we look forward to these China talks. Secretary Besant, Ludnick, USTR Jameson Greer were expecting a new round of China talks, they said, early next month.  But it also looks like Besson and Ludnick are going to Japan where they could perhaps cross paths with the Chinese or even pick up the talks with the Japanese which themselves are having problems right now in those negotiations.

Trump has really not been you know  horse trading. There's not really been an indication of that. And you mentioned in the top about this sort of musing about setting a higher floor. That is one of the biggest questions I had this week. He told the NBC yesterday, hey, we're looking at maybe 15 percent or 20 percent. We don't know whether he meant just for these countries, about five dozen, the ones where the U.S. has a goods trade deficit  Is he talking about those, the ones that have been paused at 10%, are they going to go up 15? Or is he talking about everyone? He's talking about every country, including ones where the US runs a trade surplus, including ones that are like friends, like Australia, the UK, that kind of thing. And if that's what he's talking about, he's talking about a very widespread increase.  And not to drone on too much, but last night we had the Canada development, that letter to Canada saying he'd raise the rate to 35%. Really important caveat here. Right now it's a three-tiered system for U.S. tariffs on Canada. 25% for a lot of products, 10% for some energy products, and 0% for USMCA-compliant goods. That's Trump's reworked NAFTA from his first term.  We are told that the 35% rate is poised to be applied only to that 25% rate. The 10 would stay where it is, and the USMCA would remain with its carve-out as of now. That's the expectation, but our source is cautioning us that this is a fluid situation, and as we know with Donald Trump, anything's possible.

The Americans never said that deadline. They never published it. It's not in writing like the July 9th and August 1st deadlines are, and so it's unclear whether or not  They're still trying to reach something by then. Now, of course, Trump has put this August 1st date on there. If all that's happening on August 1st with Canada is that the rate goes from 25 to 35 but other things don't change, it's not clear how Prime Minister Carney will react and whether he'll have much incentive  to give stuff in return to try to haggle to a lower rate. I should note, of course, Canadian public sentiment is very sour.

And if all those dominoes fall that way, the tariff barrage coming on August 1st will be more on the smaller end of the range of outcomes. The flip side is if he just keeps farming out letters,  and doesn't get deals that he likes and starts announcing unilateral deals like with Vietnam that maybe the other countries balk at, then we could just have an August 1st filled with announcements, including potentially if things go sideways with, say, the EU, which has been a very silent issue here. Big block, huge trading partner, had been facing a tariff increase. Trump hasn't said a peep, although he alluded on Thursday in an interview with NBC that there might be a letter to the EU coming. So we'll see. I think there's a few sort of  bellwethers, the EU chief among them, but we just don't know the scale of the tariff situation that we're walking into on August 1st.

But I mean, of course, people are really looking to see whether or not it'll rise to 20. At what point would you raise an eyebrow and say, hey, the market is really nervous about what's going on right now?  Look, I think volatility can still exist. And I wouldn't be surprised if we woke up next week and we get a sharp rise in volatility because of some announcement that we're not thinking about today. I mean, typically, those sharp rises in volatility happen because of something unexpected.  The one thing I do have to say that I feel a little bit better about more recently is the breadth that we're seeing in the market. And instead of that intense, deep concentration in just a handful of names, you're kind of seeing positive performance out of almost all industries in the S&P and more broadly even down cap.  And within those industries, you're starting to see companies with good fundamentals starting to act more favorably. And that's a healthy sign. And it shows that there's, you know, to the point of complacency, I think there's some real work that is being done to really look at company fundamentals and try to position where you want to be for the next, you know, event. So if you look at the market from New Year's Day to now,  It's almost like we're in the same place. So much has happened in between, but we're still flirting with all-time highs here. But that being said, I won't necessarily ask you where are the safe haven areas, but where are the areas for opportunity right now? What are you telling your clients? Yeah, it's a great question, and it's a question we get asked often, right? So I always think about it as risk versus reward.  And I would say from a market cap standpoint, I really like the kind of the smooth cap space. So not all the way down to small cap, but that mid to small area, there's still a lot of names and companies that have continued to perform well.  especially ones with strong balance sheets, experienced management teams, and companies that can kind of control their own destiny, have a lot of flexibility, even given all the changing kind of rules and things happening around them. That's a sweet spot in the kind of size space. In terms of industries,  Like health care, I see a lot of our investment teams taking interest there, but not out of the typical health care services, drug areas. Underneath, if you think about where the next layer of innovation is going to come from, how are you going to  How are we all going to get health care a little bit more efficiently and in a new probably way.

And I can keep going on. And that really explains the momentum we have. We delivered our third  consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth and growing our profitability. And that is why we believe that we are stepping into the second half. We believe we can manage through the uncertainty of tariffs. The tariff situation is fluid. We assumed an incremental 10 percent on tariffs from the rest of the world and 30 percent from China.  Our view is we are competitively in a better spot to manage through this. Sixty percent of our business is international. We have a fairly diversified supply chain and we've been agile over the years in managing through some of the uncertainties. We've got some mitigation actions, Tim.  We are working with our vendors. A large piece of our growth is driven by higher volumes. And that makes a difference when you're negotiating with our tenured relationships over the years. We are driving higher full-price sales because our product offers are working. And we are targeting some pricing actions with minimal impact to the consumer. To your question about 26.  We are working through that. Some of the mitigation actions will continue. We believe the brand momentum continues. The brand has never been stronger. You know, this year, it's all about center of culture, driven through music. We've got a partnership with Beyonce.

The consumer so far has been resilient.  Our customers, our wholesale retailers, are still buying our products, especially our new product. And because we are a global company, international, for example, has been fairly strong. So, as we manage through the uncertainty, we are trying to do it thoughtfully.  You know, we don't take anything for granted. You know, our view is you've got to continue to earn the trust with our consumers every day. And, you know, especially in moments of crisis, consumers tend to gravitate to brands that are relevant and also, you know, brands they trust. And, you know, because we have been  around for 170 years, navigated different crises. That's really been the genesis of why we think we can manage through it. We talked about the impact. We talked about actions that we're taking to mitigate that. And more importantly, we are doing different scenarios. I mean, yesterday, after earnings, when we received news about certain tariffs, we went back and game planned that through another scenario. So we're working through different scenarios.

So whether it's steel and aluminum, or whether it's copper where we just made a major announcement on that, or whether it's pharmaceuticals, the endgame for the 232 tariffs is  is to strengthen our defense industrial base, our manufacturing base, and in the case of pharmaceuticals, our health industrial base. Again, as a veteran of the first Trump term, I was the guy, the Defense Production Act policy coordinator  who was in charge of getting all the medicines and the PPE and getting the vaccine thing jump-started and all of that. And we learned some very harsh lessons there. Certainly, there was just incredible rhetoric from China at one point where they were going to drown us in a sea of virus and withhold  things from us if we dared say that the virus was from the Wuhan lab.

The way it works is there's this thing called the Congressional Budget Office. We talk about it a lot already.  When you do a bill like that, it's the CBO that does the official forecast."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 492.628, "text": "And you want dynamic story."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 493.489, "text": "And historically, they've just been far more wrong than right, dating back to the first term. And so all you got to know about the CBO forecast this time around is that it assumes a 1.8 rate of economic growth, which we think is way too low.  And from that 1.8, and they don't put in any dynamic effects to speak of, and when they try to do that they screwed that up to whatever, they came up with a two to three trillion dollar increase in the debt. Okay? It's like, no, wait a minute. Here's what you're not doing. Two things. One is that if you simply increase the growth rate,  by one percent we did in the first term cbo got it wrong same way in the first term you raise a couple of trillion dollars as you get get almost a zero okay you get the neutrality they didn't count the tariff revenues and that's like that's a truly normal executive branch not from congress they can't technical but they should have counted it because  it counts towards the debt. I mean, look at it, $100 billion in, I don't know, the first six months. We're going to have a situation where if you simply do the numbers right for the big, beautiful bill, it's a significant reduction in the debt. And what that'll do, if you want to segue to Jay Powell, what that'll do is it'll actually lower yields  and interest rates because we'll have to finance less. Now, with respect to Powell, I think there's a strong argument that can be made that he's at least 50 basis points above where he should be, and we should be in a place where we should be 50 basis points lower now, moving towards even lower. And let's just deconstruct what 50 basis points too high means. That's about a quarter to a half point of GDP growth reduction.  And that in turn means about 500,000 to 750,000 fewer jobs that we'll create because of J-PAL. It's a couple of hundred billion dollars in lost output and there's billions lost in tax revenues. Then when you go from there, and I was watching Lael, I'm sure you have Lael Brainard.  I saw her on a other network yesterday and she has no clue. It's like she was talking about the big beautiful bill and Powell and all this stuff, but 20 to 30 percent of our debt is financed by short-term debt. That's the way they roll that.  So, if you look at a half point more on the short-term debt, that's a couple hundred billion dollars that you build into the debt over 10 years. That's real money. Mortgage rates, average family, $400,000 30-year mortgage, that's over $1,000 a year. And then, this is the last point, a trillion dollars of revolving credit card debt, that's about $5 billion more  that consumers pay. So this idea of what's wrong with weighting?

It's like this op-ed I had in The Hill basically looked at all the Fed chairmen we've had over the last, I don't know, 40 years and ranked them. Who was good and who was bad.

William Miller is in the middle of that mix, sits on his hands.  He was the other lawyer in the mix besides Powell, totally unqualified. You went through Greenspan, Bernanke, fast forward to Powell. Greenspan, not understanding how the dot-com was going to bring productivity and allow you to go forward without inflation.  But Powell has made three major blunders. In the first term, he raised rates too fast. He was like too early, Powell. And that's been documented by the Fed itself. He made a mistake.

They are the vanguard for saving this country.  13 years ago, when I first started Turning Point USA and this journey began, if you would have told me 13 years later that we would have someone running for the presidency as a Republican, winning the youth vote in major states,  I would say, how would that be possible? 13 years ago, we started the journey, and it was chapter by chapter, student by student, person by person, prove me wrong by prove me wrong, liberal by liberal, proving one wrong at a time, and billions and billions of views later, what happened in November was a shot heard around the world. You see, all Kamala Harris needed to do was get younger people to vote at the same margins that Joe Biden got them to vote back in 2020.  Did you know that baby boomers moved three points more Democrat back in November? Aha. But younger voters moved 22 points to the right in November. The youth delivered the White House to Donald Trump. The next generation rose up in record numbers, and I started to see it at the Prove Me Wrongs across America.  We would just start with a couple hundred students, and all of a sudden like a thousand students would come. And all of a sudden they'd be wearing red hats as far as the eye could see. I said, there's something profound happening in this country. There's something that is deep, that is larger than what the media is covering. And we turned that red MAGA hat from a symbol that everybody was afraid to wear back in 2016, where now in 2024, we turned that into a symbol of hope,  into a symbol of optimism, of patriotism, and taking back our country. Back in November, when we rose up, younger voters saw President Trump as a lifeline. President Donald Trump represented for them a way to try to get everybody's attention that things were not all right for this generation.  You see, I spend a lot of time talking to Next Generation. We just did an entire, prove me wrong with many of you out in the hall. I did over 100 hours of campus debates this last semester. 200 hours in one year. Over 65 campuses that I visit. And a through line is repeated. Whether they're Republican or Democrat or conservative or liberal, there is an angst, there's an uneasiness, there is a worry, there is a concern. And they say in no uncertain terms, Charlie, I'm trying to get my leader's attention. I can't afford a home.  I can't afford basic necessities. If I ask a girl out on a date and I get one word wrong, she could report me for sexual harassment. I am surrounded by this political correctness where if I don't get the pronouns correct of the trans activist next to me in class, it could be the end of my career.  My town, my city is flooded by illegal aliens. Charlie, when will my leaders start fighting for me and my generation? I hear every single day from you in this audience, the students, Charlie, why is it that we spend hundreds of billions of dollars on wars abroad, but our own generation has to go endlessly in debt to pay our medical bills and suffer under credit card debt? Why is it that our young, why you, the next generation, have to compete  to buy a home against a Chinese oligarch. Let me be very clear. No foreign national should be allowed to own single-family homes until this generation can have the same homes that their parents have. And this angst and this unease built up and built up, and it culminated in the election of Donald Trump. The youth delivered the White House for President Trump. And understand that now six, seven months later,  We've inherited a disordered economy from Joe Biden. If we do not deliver on economic promises, especially for the next generation, if we do not make you owners of this economy, not just renters of this economy, then you're going to see a lot more Zoran Mamdanis.  Now, we should boo Zoran Mamdani. The guy is a bigot, anti-civilization to his core, anti-American, anti-Western, wants to nationalize or make all the grocery stores run by the government, defund the police. All that is garbage. But we fail to understand why he is rising. Yeah, part of it is that people in New York are not like you wonderful people here in Florida. That's partially it. But there's a deeper thing at play.  Younger voters are trying to get their leaders' attention. We can't afford anything. Homes are out of reach. I'm tired of renting all the time, and I have zero equity to my name. If we do not solve the economic disorder that is facing this generation, from the debts, the deficits, student loan debt, cost of living, then Mamdani will just be the beginning  of what you're going to see in communities across the country. So what is the solution? Well, the solution is what President Trump is trying to do every single day, and we need more of it. We need double and tripling down on it. Starting with those of you that are looking for a job, you should not have to compete against a foreigner for your job. American college graduates should come first. And that starts with  President Donald Trump, and this will affect everybody in this room regardless of age. It is time for the largest deportation effort this country has ever seen.  If you are here illegally, you are deported from the United States of America. Period. No amnesty. Repeat after me. No amnesty. Period. End of story. We will not put up with any exceptions, any carve-outs, any loopholes, any exceptions, any asterisks, any iotas. I don't care if it's 10 years or 15 years.  We voted for mass deportations, we did not vote for mass amnesty, and we expect our leaders to deliver it and bring back our country to a place of citizenship and Americans being put first. Number two, very important, it is more than past time for our elected leaders to understand  that they're going to have to put the economics of the next generation into their calculus. This is something that Mom Donnie does, but he does it so sloppily. He says, if you're bitter and you don't like the country, vote for me and I'm gonna give you a bunch of free stuff. Everybody, endless tax cuts just for the wealthy. That's fine, I like tax cuts, it's good. My radio show does really well, podcast does well. But I'll tell you right now, you are going to see a massive breakdown of the political order. If people don't own stuff,  our politics are about to get a lot more radical. But let's go a step further. We need to celebrate, embrace, platform, and sometimes, if necessary, subsidize getting married and having children. We are not having enough children in this country.  This is a national crisis. I don't want to hear about, well, you know, racism is a threat to America. It's a bunch of horsepucky. Oh, environmentalism, climate change. Do you know what a threat to our country is? We're not having enough babies. Now, my wife and I, we are doing our part. We have two young children, and we'll see what else the Lord has in store.  But I was fascinated today by talking to our amazing young patriots as part of Turning Point USA. I was so moved. And they say, Charlie, I want to get married. I want to have kids. It's hard to find other people that share my values. By the way, for everyone watching online, if you want to find your future husband or wife, that's why you should be here in Tampa, Florida, because there's a lot of eligible bachelor and bachelorettes here, a lot. But we must prioritize it. We should tell our young ladies.  that if you wanna go be the CEO of a shoe company, that's fine, but do you know what's really gonna matter 30 years from now? What's gonna matter is whether or not you have the love of your life and you have decided to raise children. It doesn't matter how many trips to Thailand you make. It doesn't matter how many nights out at the club. What matters is what lasts, and what matters is things that are hard. What strikes me about this generation, this generation is the most conservative generation that we have seen in well over 50 years, and the numbers show it.  This is the greatest generational realignment since Woodstock. We have never seen a generation move so quickly and so fast. And you guys are making all the liberals confused. They thought you were going to be the most liberal generation.  But part of the reasons why this happened is those of you that are here in this audience and the millions of people that voted for President Trump and that are part of our movement, you were lied to so repeatedly. Wear the mask. Take the vaccine. No prom. No graduation. School closures. America's a racist country. You experienced the worst of the American left. And your politics now is a rejection of all of that garbage. No more political correctness. And you know what's amazing?  Church attendance was going down steadily in America the last 20 years. It's gone up slightly because this is the most religious generation that we have seen in 40 years. Do you understand the significance of that? Because at its core, what we are fighting is a spiritual battle. This is a spiritual sickness throughout the West. And if you're here and you don't believe in God, OK, fine, I'll pray for you. And I hope you find Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, because it will change your life.  But understand, you should even be cheering for a religious revival. You get the worst ideas when you have secularism. Men give birth. No borders. America's a terrible country. These things are almost all outgrowths of secularism. But this generation, you guys want something deeper. You want something more. And let me put this in existential terms.  If we do not deliver, we are going to see all of these gains made by Donald Trump, and many of these people will either not vote at all, or they'll be scooped up by some Democrat opportunist. What needs to happen is a couple things. I'm still waiting for it. Where is the national apology to you guys, this generation, for what happened to you during COVID?  Where is the apology saying, we never should have shut down the schools, we never should have taken graduation from you, we never should have forced a vaccine on you that doesn't work and kicked you out of school if you didn't take it? And the lack of the apology shows that we are in, we are in, dare I say, a turning point. We are in a place where decisions need to be made, a time for choosing.  And our leaders in D.C. better start to get the memo. Because there is a movement coming. And yes, it is the most conservative generation. But that doesn't mean they're gonna support every single Republican. If you're a Republican, and you support, yay, more foreign aid to endless countries, Gen Z doesn't want that, actually. They want Americans to be put first, not foreigners to be put first. If you're a Republican,  And all of a sudden you say, we're just going to, you know, let the market do its job. And we don't care, even though things are incredibly out of reach. You're going to say, you know what? No. I like what President Trump is doing at tariffs. I want stuff made in America again. You see, there is a new ascendant movement. I've done my best to try to warn people what is coming. And I think it's exciting. I think it's new. I think it's fresh. I think it's authentic. Because if you look at the last 50 years, we've had a ton of problems in this country, from our debts and our deficits to our hyperinflation.  to mass migration. And another thing that this generation increasingly believes, they don't necessarily believe that immigration makes your country better. You only get Mom Donny, you get Elon Omar and Rashida Tlaib not just because of illegal immigration.  It's legal immigration that is also the problem. When you allow a bunch of people into your country legally and they don't share your values, turns out they don't always assimilate. Mamdani and his entire family came here legally. They didn't come across the southern border. No one can tell me that that person is improving the United States of America. He's a self-righteous, narcissistic parasite on New York City and should be expelled from politics, but we let him in. Maybe it's time.  Maybe it is time for us to reconsider almost all of our political orthodoxies. Do immigrants really make our country better? Some do. Some of our amazing Cuban immigrants here that I see in the audience, you've assimilated, you make America better. But if you come from Somalia and you refuse to learn our language, adopt to our customs, and assimilate, I'm sorry, America is closed to the third world until further notice. We are not a dumping ground for the rest of the planet.  The Democrat Party is trying to figure themselves out right now, and they're in a position where they don't really know their leader, but they will eventually figure it out. They're a major political party, and they're desperate to get back into action. But this is where things really become real very quickly, is that this is the greatest opportunity that I am afraid that some in the Republican Party are messing up. President Trump understands this better than anybody else.  You understand how incredible that is, what a death blow it is to win the youth vote as a Republican? Do you know what that means? That means if you hold on to that demographic and that generation, it's done for the left. So shouldn't it be that our leaders should be thinking every single day, how do I hold on to this and grow it?  Instead, at times, I don't always feel that energy out of Washington, D.C. Instead, I feel as if they take you for granted, the younger voters that are going through this. And you know what? The next couple days, we need to make our voice heard. We need to send a message to D.C. and to the rest of the bipartisan cartel that we want our own interests represented. Because if we allow the generational theft to continue, which is the plundering of the next generation,  Then I'll say it once, I'll say it twice, you will see a radicalization event from the left that will take your breath away. But here is the advantage, everybody, is that we are the ascendant political force. We did the impossible. We turned campuses into MAGA. We moved the youth vote by 20 or 30 points. We turned the country from super woke to all of a sudden super patriotic in a short period of time.  But now this is where all of you, it matters. If you are not yet involved in a Turning Point USA chapter, start one. Start a high school or college chapter. Go to the Turning Point USA booth after this and say, I want to go start a chapter. I want to get involved on my college campus.  If you are not a student and you're listening to this, politics is now a 24-7 sport. Get involved in your school board. Get involved in your city council. Support your local Turning Point USA chapter. Hold your Senate accountable. Who here is from South Carolina? Anybody from South Carolina? Great. Go primary Lindsey Graham and make sure he's no longer a sitting U.S. Senator.  Who here is from\u2014let's pick a state. Who here is from Kentucky? Anybody? Anybody from Kentucky? Great. I'm behind Nate Morris. I think he'd be a great person to replace Mitch McConnell. We need to make sure that the Mitch McConnell era ends in Kentucky and does not continue to spread. Everybody, this movement is a grassroots movement at its core. And it's a question the next couple of days, and you're going to hear from a wide variety of speakers. You're going to hear from Tucker Carlson tonight.  You're going to hear from Donald Trump Jr. You're going to hear from Megyn Kelly. You're going to hear from Pete Hegseth. You're going to hear from Kristi Noem. And it is time for us to chart a vision. President Donald Trump took the entire country on his shoulders and was millimeters away from having his brains blown out. And by the way, we're going to remember it this weekend. This weekend is July 13th, where President Trump was this close from losing his life.  But everybody, what a tragedy it would be if, by divine intervention, God saved the country and we decided to just cast it aside, where we have this ascendant, exciting, charismatic, bottom-up energy of young people from across America. And the mandate is very simple. Business as usual as D.C. will no longer work. It is time for us to get involved in primaries. It's time for us to make our voice heard.  It's time for us to take over the Republican Party in a conservative image. It's time for us to support the good guys and out the bad guys. And at times, for all the young people out there, you need to keep fighting on your college campus. I know you're outnumbered by the purple-haired jihadis on a daily basis. I know that everybody on a college campus, they try to intimidate you, they try to threaten you.  But everyone who's not a student in here, I want to reiterate this. What they're doing is one of the hardest things to do in the United States of America. They are deciding to be less popular on campus. They are deciding to actually speak out with a high social cost. They're deciding, even though it might jeopardize their job, their career, or their reputation, to put their country over themselves. And I think that deserves recognition and gratitude, because that is what is the best of this country is. I'll close with this.  We've been given this gift, popular vote majority, electoral vote majority, and now it's on us. We have to execute. We have to have mass deportations.  We have to make sure the border wall is secure. We have to make sure that we fulfill all of our promises when it comes to transparency. We have to make sure that young people can afford homes. If we fail to do this, the coalition will be put in jeopardy. I have faith in President Trump. I do not have faith in the Republican Congress.  These next couple of days here in Tampa, Florida, all 7,000 of you, you are the center of the political universe on the planet right now. Everybody is looking to Tampa, Florida. What will happen here will determine, will chart a new future course. Marriages will happen this weekend.  Lifetime friendships will happen this weekend. Careers will start this weekend. And my challenge for all of you is hold yourself to a higher standard. Make this an action event. This is not like just going to a Tampa Bay Buccaneers game and applauding all the time.  Every speaker say, what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do? Apply the applause into action. We've been given this gift. The next generation helped put Donald Trump into the White House. What comes next will determine whether or not we're a civilization, we're just a collection of colonies and strangers in our own nation. God bless you guys.

Last month, the United States bombed multiple Iranian nuclear sites, involving us in a war between Iran and Israel.

I think it's wise, given how weakened the Iranians are, to try to reach an agreement to limit and make it impossible for them to obtain a nuclear weapon, which I think would be disastrous.  for our interest and for the region. And so I would urge any administration, I urge the last one, I urge this one, to try to reach a deal that can constrain the Iranians' ability to develop a nuclear weapon. We've got pretty clear data that when there was a nuclear agreement in place, the Iranians were enriching less uranium  then they were able to enrich once the Trump administration took us out of the nuclear deal with the Iranians. That tells us that a deal with, I think, strict scrutiny and safeguards can work.

I share the goal that the Iranians should not have a nuclear weapon, period. I'm also someone who believes deeply, and I've thought this whether there was a Democratic president or a Republican president, that we have seen presidents for too long ignore Congress's constitutional power here to decide whether we send Americans to war. And in my book, certainly sending Americans over the airspace of a foreign country and dropping bombs is the kind of conduct that only the Congress can authorize in this kind of strike. And so I've been  Disappointed to see this president do that. I've been disappointed in the past to see Democratic and Republican presidents ignore Congress.

I mean, it was really the number one issue we all campaigned on. We see what it happened, what it did to so much of America, what it did to so many communities. And honestly, what it did to so many of the low-income communities in this country where  People were just sweeping those jobs, and ultimately, everyone's potential American dream was getting wiped away. And so the big, beautiful bill, the funding of the wall, the funding of ICE is so fundamentally important to actually getting these things done, right? We saw what we could do about just the border itself.  But now you have 20 million people, probably. I imagine they don't even know. Just getting in there, they're getting all the benefits. You know, the benefits that you guys pay for for yourselves, that your parents probably paid for for all of you guys. They get that with no contribution to the system. And that was by design.  under the Biden administration. So to have the funding to, A, start the mass deportations, but more importantly, the parts of the bill that literally cut off all of the freebies that were just draining our coffers, but more importantly, were a calling card to the rest of the world. Be like, you know, come here, we'll give you everything. You know, the health care that you got gets diluted because you get to pay for thousands of others, millions of others, tens of millions of others,  who will likely never even pay into the system. It doesn't work. It doesn't work in any other country. And there's a reason no other country was doing it. So, you know, that was a fundamental aspect of the big beautiful bill to now actually have the funding to do this. And it was sort of amazing to me.  how much even reluctance there was from so many, you know, allegedly on our side, who said, well, it's just controversial. You're going to have to deport someone. You know, listen, there's going to be good people that this happens to, too, but there are millions of criminals. And this is Joe Biden's eyes. I mean, when I saw the statistics, I literally couldn't believe that a civilization could survive  When you, you know, our Western values, our culture, the civilization itself, when they literally admitted, and, you know, this is Biden ice stats, so this is probably diluted a lot, but 600,000 criminals, 13,000 murderers. I mean, think about that. 13,000 murderers were let into the country. They knew they were murderers, and they let them into the country. 16,000 rapists.  Add those together, you got what, 30,000, let's call it, 30,000 murderers and rapists. There's about 4,000 counties in America. Imagine you spread them out evenly throughout that.

We've seen what happens when some of these places, oh, it's going to be a disaster. Oh, wow, there's a line of Americans ready to do some of these jobs. You know, a big part of it was also, you know, from the corporate tax cuts standpoint, right? That's great. I mean, I'm a business guy. I love the corporate tax cuts.  But I think what was really unique about the BBB was how much time, energy, and political capital my father put into making sure those tax cuts translate down to working class Americans. OK, when you have the no tax on tips.  All of these ideas, they're going to benefit Americans so greatly. The original tax plan from the first administration, it did just that. Everyone said, oh, it's just corporate, it's just corporate. But I think the stats were like close to 90% of Americans, like regular people,  got thousands and thousands of dollars in real benefits to them. And that's the idea. I mean, his fundamental purpose is to make sure that those real Americans, the hardworking Americans who've seen their wages diminished with inflation, we're getting that under control, too, but that were really struggling for the last few years, actually get to see the benefits of these cuts. And again, it's one of those things where my father had to go way out of his way, because, you know, the Republican climate, well, we're going to do it for corporations, and maybe some of that will trickle down.

So when you call dad, she's nodding, she's like, yep. When you call dad, he's going to do it, right? It doesn't matter. So it wasn't even the perfect day. I was like, yep, I'm going to go get bait. We're going to go deal with it. We're going to go fishing.  You know, we were out probably 13, 14 miles offshore, having a great day, catching fish, and we got the call.

That's only a call that has degrees of bad, right? And we didn't know anything. And we're frantically kind of calling. I guess the only thing that I guess they did right that day was shut down other communications. And so I think we set the sea speed record from offshore into Jupiter, where we live. And finally, we're able to get my dad on the phone. And it was sort of a...  a harrowing thing. By then we had seen some of the videos of him coming back up with the sort of fight, fight, fight, and I just got on the phone. Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not usually at a loss for words, but that was one of those where I was like, I got nothing, but I was like, that's the most badass thing I've ever seen. I was like, I'm not sure if it's, like, the tactically the most intelligent thing I've ever seen either. You know, like, you know. Yeah, just stand up again. What could go wrong? You know, so I was like, but, you know, it was this sort of somber moment. And finally it was just, again, it got awkward enough. I was like, OK, so we got to ask the most important question, which is,  How's the hair?\" And he gave me the, you know, Don, Don, Don, the hair is fine. It's a little bloody. There was a lot of blood, a lot of blood, Don.  But the hair is fine. It'll be good. I'm going to have to wash it. And it sort of broke the ice. And I'm not going to say it got normal again, but it normalized the situation. And my daughter was with me. And Kai has probably spent more time with my dad one-on-one than I have. And I'm a lot older than her, largely because of golf. And she's like his golf buddy. And she plays with him every weekend when he was around. And that was all the time.  She called me that next morning and she's like, you know what, I want to speak at the RNC.  To be clear, it's my daughter, so it wasn't exactly, I want to, like, it wasn't a question. It was like, I'm going to. And I'm just like, I guess I'll bump some governor, like, just, you know. And you did. Well, I didn't do anything. I called my dad. This was like a six o'clock in the morning call. He picks up on the first ring. I'm like, hey, you doing good? By the way, Kai wants to speak at the RNC. And he just goes, whoa.  Well, listen, when you do this every day... By the way, we've seen guys that do this every day and still blow that, right? When there's 40,000 people and you're in a stadium and there's 10 million, 20 million people watching on television and you've never given a speech in your life, that is not easy.  It's hard for most people, again, who do it. It's like they're used to a small crowd, and that's easy. It's a lot of pressure. And he's just like, that's a big one. That could go wrong really quickly, and we understand how bad that can go. But he just thought about it for a second. He goes, you know what? That kid's a winner. She'll do great. That was it.
