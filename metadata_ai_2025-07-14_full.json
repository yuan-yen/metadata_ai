Obviously, we make the best weapons systems.  in the world, and everyone wants them, and we're going to prioritize those going to Ukraine. And what this says also to Vladimir Putin, I think, is very loud and clear, which is, you know, we've given you a chance for peace. President Trump is a peacemaker. But if you want war, we will arm Ukraine, and Europe will pay for it. And it's actually, I think, a great step in ultimately bringing this war to a conclusion, to an end. You know, in the last 18 months,  Russia has gained about 1% of Ukrainian land. I mean, they're making no success. They're losing thousands of soldiers every single day. And way too many private citizens in Ukraine and the big cities are being injured. So I think this is a great next step in finally ending this war.

But this is a natural progression of what we did in The Hague at the NATO summit, too.  We move the burden off the American taxpayer for European defense and on to European taxpayers, where it should be. And the traditional defense of Europe is now going to be borne by the European population. And at the same time, we're doing the same thing with the Ukrainian war. President Trump said today $350 billion of American taxpayer money has gone to support Ukraine. No longer. But at the same time, we're not cutting them off from weapons, and we're also  also not making the United States of America less secure.

You know, I've seen some of those manufacturing things like in Lima, Ohio, where they build tanks, for example.

Alec Murdoch's surviving son, Buster, who you saw in court if you followed the case, released a statement after the family of Stephen Smith raised money to exhume his body and conduct an independent autopsy. So you may be asking, what is this case? Who is Stephen Smith? Well, his death in 2015 was ruled a hit and run.  after he was found in the middle of the road, not far from the Murdoch's family property, Moselle, where the bodies of Maggie and Paul were found. Authorities reopened this investigation years later in 2021 after uncovering some information while investigating the deaths of Maggie and Paul. Well, a recently released documentary on Netflix suggests that Smith and Murdoch's oldest son, Buster, may have had some sort of relationship. Well, we haven't heard from Buster until  Now, he is speaking out this morning, and he is releasing a statement saying, in part, these baseless rumors of my involvement with Stephen and his death are false. I unequivocally deny any involvement in his death, and my heart goes out to the Smith family. I am requesting that the media immediately stop publishing these defamatory comments and rumors about me.  Joining us this morning, criminal defense attorney and legal analyst, Jonna Spillbore. She followed the Murdoch double murder trial with us, and now we've got this other case. Thanks for being here. You know, for those of us who know all of the different layers to this case, Stephen Smith was a big part of this investigation early on. And the fact that this case got reopened, we still don't yet know what the evidence was that prompted them to take a second look at this, do we?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 124.872, "text": " No, we don't. But let's take a look at what we do know. And I think we should make clear that we are not on the cusp of a Murdoch mystery Netflix series sequel right now. What we have here is not the authorities requesting that the body of Stephen Smith be exhumed and another autopsy performed. This is being done privately by Sandy Smith, Stephen's mother. Now, we cannot blame Sandy for wanting to do this.  She, I'm sure, tuned into the Murdoch murder trial as well. She's had questions about whether or not her son was the victim of an accident, an accidental hit and run, or something worse. So she's basically been able to garner some sympathy and create a GoFundMe to create the funds, because this is not a cheap date. In order to exhume somebody, it's costly to hire a private person to do a second autopsy. It is expensive.  So she's going to go ahead and do that for her own satisfaction. What could possibly come from this? Maybe nothing. Or if there is some information that perhaps was overlooked back in 2015, Sandy Smith can bring that to the authorities sled and say, look what I have here. Now, what are you going to do with this new information?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 202.784, "text": " So it's been eight years though, John.

What happened that day?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 214.141, "text": " Right, and that's exactly why I'm feeling sorry for Sandy Smith, in a sense, because evidence does not get better with time. And we do not know how badly decomposed her son's body is going to be. It may reveal absolutely nothing new. In fact, sometimes when you have a situation like this, specifically,  We know that there was trauma to Stephen Smith's head and body. So that part is not going to change. What could possibly change is if they didn't do some toxicology testing, for example, and maybe there is enough tissue that's still intact for them to do that. But I really think that's going to lead down a road to nowhere.  And let's be specific here. Really what she's looking for is to tie specifically Buster Murdoch to the death of her son Stephen Smith. And right now there really is nothing but speculation. We have no more information than we did back then except for the fact  that we know that the Murdoch family reign is over. And maybe people might want to come forward with information now that they didn't want to come forward with in 2015, but that has nothing to do with the condition of the body or what they'll find in a second autopsy."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 289.454, "text": " All right, how about some inside scoop in a NewsNation exclusive.

Let's please welcome back Alex's attorney, Jim Griffin. Counselor, thank you for taking the opportunity. Happy to be here, Chris.  So help me understand the big obvious question. Why would a guy who knows he's a target want to go to a place where he can be victimized? Well, Chris, Alec is a guy who does not want to be isolated in a cell 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In protective custody, it's not like that. But it's pretty isolated.  He wants to contribute. There are a lot of things that he can do in the general population. I mean, he's a lawyer, he's a college-educated person, and there are programs where he can assist with. He has heard from the prison officials that there have been threats against him. He's not received those directly. He had some threats when he was in the county jail, but  but he was able to navigate through that. You know, anytime you're in prison and you're a name like he is, you're gonna be challenged. And he had been challenged at the county jail, but he was able to overcome and develop relationships. And he was productive in the county jail. And he think he can be productive in the general population. I mean, he would rather take his chances on the yard than right away in a cell, to be honest with you.  Let's talk about what that says about his state of mind right now. First of all, do you think that he's got a little bit of a death wish? Yes, he's hanging out with cops and sexual predators and other people they put in protective custody, but he's outside the box most of the day in their company. Do you think that he wants to get hurt? No, absolutely not. I mean, Alec had, he had, you know,  the death wish, death attempt back in Labor Day of 2021. And from that day since, he has been a man who has been sober, and he has been rational, and he plans to continue. He looks forward to the day of getting out of prison. We've gotten an appeal pending. We're very hopeful of the appeal. He's a lawyer. He saw how things went. And so,  he is not someone who has given up hope. He has hope for the future. He has hope he will get out one day and he definitely does not have a death wish. Now you don't dispute that Alec Murdoch has heard on that video, nor do you dispute that that, um, makes his initial reckoning about where he was and when false. Your argument is, but he doesn't sound like a killer in it. Am I right? Correct. Um, now why isn't the lie enough, Jim?  Well, first, I mean, the lie is clearly problematic. In and of itself, it's a lie. In and of itself, it puts him down at the kennels at 844. But in and of itself, it doesn't mean he killed them. What you have to buy into is that they were dead at 848 or 849.  And that's the whole cell phone data that if someone is found dead, you know, an hour and a half after they last used their phone, then they are dead when they stop using their phone last. That was the state's whole time of death analysis. And we pushed back on that really hard. And that juror obviously disregarded it. And it seemed like all the other jurors disregarded it. And they were, you know,  the one juror that you played the interview of was more convinced that he did it because he lied about being down there. I mean, that was problematic. And the way we addressed it is put Alec on the stand, and by the time he testified, he was a lying, cheating, stealing lawyer who would steal money from his own mother and grandmother, you know, and the view of the evidence that was in front of the jury.  When that juror said he never cried, he could not have been talking about never crying about Paul and Maggie because he bawled the whole time on the stand.  In fairness to that juror, he was talking about he never cried about stealing money from his clients. I assume that's what it's about."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 608.061, "text": "Well, or even this.

Uh, do you believe it was the wrong move to put him on the stand? Looking back on it? Um, actually no, and that may surprise people, but, but it changed from day to day. But frankly, Chris,  At the time of appointing the trial where we had to make that decision, all the bad act evidence was already before the jury. One reason, as you know, you're a lawyer and anyone who tries cases, particularly criminal cases, one of the things you consider is what do you open the door to when you put the witness on the stand? And here, had we put him up,  and none of the financial crimes had been introduced in the evidence, we would have likely opened the door to introduction of the financial crimes. But that had already been done, and he was so beat up at that point, frankly, you know, we had to throw a Hail Mary by putting him on the stand to explain the lie, explain why he cheated, explain why he stole, and because of his drug addiction, and we had hoped that jurors had  experience, whether family members or relatives of, you know, how drug addicts lie, cheat and steal, and that they would have understanding of that. And, you know, obviously that did not work. Did he think he did a good job on the stand? Did he regret taking the stand? Did he insist on going on the stand? He wanted to testify the whole time and, and, and it was a consultation. I'll tell you, you know, we did not disagree with, with his,  analysis, which was this jury is going to want to hear from me, particularly because I'm a lawyer, I'm articulate and I'm accused of killing my wife and son. And he's not wrong about that. And but, you know, as as as a tactical matter, you have to weigh that against the jury's ability to not hold it against him if he doesn't testify. And in any event, like I said, we had all this other evidence we had to deal with.  that had come in under this pretense of motive, which it really wasn't. It was a character assault that worked for the state. The father-son relationship is an unusual one, a special one. But consider just for a second what happened in a South Carolina courtroom today.

The trial was dubbed South Carolina's trial of the century, and the media attention was epic.  Prosecutors hammered his ever-changing testimony, but Murdoch blamed it on paranoia and pain pills. And when asked to describe the crime scene, he broke down on the stand.  Prosecutors were not moved by that because they had a smoking gun. A video from his dead son's phone showing him casually strolling with his family down by the dog kennels where they would be dead within minutes. And metadata from his wife's cell phone showed Maggie's phone was moving even after she died.  I spoke to a digital forensics expert about just how damning that evidence was. His name is Jake Green, and he's the technical lead in forensics at Invista. Here's our conversation. Okay, Jake, so I want to think of all the different reasons that could be innocuous and innocent as to why Maggie is likely dead and her phone has a life of its own. Tell me.  There's not really any. That phone is moving because somebody is physically moving it around. All the gyroscopes and pieces within this device that record it, those are moving because someone's actually holding that phone and moving around with it. So there's not really anything innocuous that we could say, oh, well, it might have just mistakenly recorded it. No, this is something that was actually recording at the time somebody was moving.  So the one thing, I mean, everybody wants to say, aha, this is a Perry Mason moment. It's impossible to tell whose hand it is in. It's impossible to tell who's flipping it around, wondering whether it'll show something in portrait or in landscape. What's the next best thing to try to figure that out? Really the activity in and around. So looking at the databases, and I saw a copy of a report that you guys used as an infographic. They used a piece of software that  automates the review of the database that all this is coming from. That piece of software does an excellent job, but at the same time a manual review of the actual data itself of that database is going to give us much more than what that piece of software can give us. So, there can be other things that can show us not only  was the phone in portrait versus landscape? And you showed off your kids, I'll show off my awesome wife. It'll show us when was the last time this phone was unlocked? Was it unlocked with a pin? Did somebody unlock it with their face? What was the brightness? What was the backlight? So my phone right now is off and it's on a black screen. If I pick it up, and it's called Raise to Awake, so if you  black screen, raise it, your screen comes back on, that setting is going to be within that database as well. So it may not be something that was pulled out by the automated software, but that database can definitely hold that piece of evidence. So in and around and what happened and estimating steps, could this person have taken that same number of steps to make it back to the house?  That movement had to have occurred somewhere. So trying to place other pieces of evidence, as well as the physical evidence of DNA and fingerprints on the device as well. And that's how you would put that phone in somebody's hand. So the 59 steps, like Maggie's phone walked 59 steps after she's dead, at 8.53, just minutes, minutes after she's dead.  and  be wrong. I always wonder if my step count is right. Like is the is the iPhone really picking up every step or could it be in a truck or could there be errors. How accurate is this. I'm trying to think of what would someone be doing around a dead body for 59 steps. It's not very far. Yeah. So the things that we've  that other folks have done is there can absolutely be flaws. It's not, there is no known accuracy for are those steps accurate within five, 10 steps. I would be more concerned with the estimated distance as that is something that is measured with GPS within the location data within that device. So I would trust the distance more than I would trust the actual, the step counts.  OK, well, that's interesting. But I do have this list I want to show you. I thought this was pretty damning, actually. It's Alex Murdoch's steps. And there are so many of them, and it seems really frantic. It starts at 6.42, and it goes right through almost every 10 minutes or so. 6.42, 6.52, 7.03, 7.15, 7.28, 7.55.  805, 902, and they're like giant steps at times, like 283 steps, 270 steps, again, 283 steps, 167 steps. They're all over the map from 642 to 805. But he also says he took a nap. And I don't know. That's kind of impossible, isn't it? I mean, that's not the kind of mistake where you could say, well, the iPhone's not always accurate. That doesn't show that he's napping.  Right, so keep in mind that the windows that we see within movements, those are typically the first indication of movement and the last indication of movement.  It's just that within that 10 minutes, it detected movement and estimates it. So you could have taken those steps in the first five minutes, the first four minutes, you could have run for the first minute. So that's just the way the phone records these items. So I think the other important thing to keep in mind is that investigators properly preserve this phone and we're able to pull out these databases.  because they were able to get them within 30 days. So this database rolls over, it's constantly. So the reason we ask about, well, what about Mr. Murdaugh's phone? What was his screen doing at the time? They may not have arrested him for 30 days or may not have seized his phone within 30 days. So that's why his data is different from what was found on the Weiss phone.  Alex Murdoch was found guilty after just three hours of deliberations and the very next day was hit with two consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": "Explains how trauma can affect emotional expression, suggesting why Buster Murdoch's testimony may appear unemotional.", "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The host introduces the topics of the Murdoch family saga, including Buster Murdoch's statement and the exhumation of Stephen Smith's body.", "SPEAKER_01": null, "SPEAKER_02": "Alex Murdoch's attorney, discusses Murdoch's desire to be in the general prison population, his state of mind, the trial outcomes, and challenges faced during the trial.", "SPEAKER_03": "Asks Buster Murdoch questions during his testimony about when he found out about his mother and brother's murders and his awareness of his father's opioid addiction.", "SPEAKER_04": "Discusses the Stephen Smith case, its connection to the Murdochs, Buster's statement denying involvement, and the legal and evidentiary aspects of both the Smith and Murdoch murder investigations.", "SPEAKER_05": null, "Sam Schweppe": null, "Secretary of State Marco Rubio": null, "Selena Zito": null, "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Senator Chuck Grassley": null, "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer": null, "Senator Patty Murray": null, "Senator Susan Collins": null, "Stephen A.

And then what will that do to our growth rate, our economic growth rate, and what will that do to economic growth in other countries? So, you know, the international trade has been a big trade this year. But if those countries start having slower corporate earnings growth because  demand for their goods and services goes down because of tariffs. And that's a question they're asking, too.

And they really won't accelerate until later in the year. So, I do think the Fed will end up staying on hold at the July meeting, and potentially for the following meeting as well, because I think it will be too soon to make a final determination about what's happening to inflation.  I think that corporate earnings are going to show up. Second quarter are probably likely to beat because you're looking at expectations of only two to three percent earnings growth in the second quarter. Very low. And the tariffs really haven't hit yet. So I think second quarter earnings, which, as you mentioned, are going to come out starting tomorrow, those are going to be OK.  I think third quarter is when we're going to hear much more hand-wringing from companies about how they're going to cope with the tariffs. And we'll see what the tariffs look like in October when we're getting those third quarter reports. Could be crypto, Bitcoin. Do you have a point of view on it? Do you have any exposure to it? What runs through your mind as you watch the price action lately?  So I think crypto and Bitcoin are really a play on inflation and on the US dollar I think of them as a currency And so I think if you're concerned about inflation and the dollar then they can deserve a place in a portfolio But they're kind of like gold in the sense that they don't they don't pay a dividend or pay any cash flows So it becomes a hedge against that and I'm a DCF person always have been so that is a little bit. Oh, yeah  Exactly, exactly. So that makes it a little bit thorny. But I do think that we are seeing some uncertainty with the dollar and with the with treasuries.

So we'll come through. So the question is, back to Trump. He said there are deals. There are no deals. There are letters that he's saying, this will be our deal. The deal takes two parties. So he's going to have to renegotiate. The question that you bring up,  At some point, he's not going to tackle it. At some point, he's got to say, we're doing this, not just with steel and aluminum, but more broadly, so every other country feels it. The critical countries are, of course, India and the EU and Japan. Once you get through those, then the others really don't matter. So I think you've got to see some deals or some maybe fake deals, like we did with the UK, where it really doesn't matter. In terms of the overall risk in the market, it's definitely the Fed.  You can't put a complete dove in there. It's definitely tariffs. It's also inflation that could come from the spending bill that was just passed. And then it's more cuts they're talking about. So I think that the market's going to continue to ignore these risks, as they have for the last year. And the market accepts, OK, in just the final word, earnings.

Scott Besson started speaking, was more prominent. And people like Peter Navarro, who the market was more skeptical of, took a step back. Now you're at the point where the president is talking again about higher tariff rates that's going to take the effect of the U.S. tariff rate up even higher than we currently anticipate it to be. So my argument would be, while we determine exactly what that level is going to be, after a truly historic rally off the lows,  Some breather is in order. And just to frame this for the viewers at home, top to bottom from the post-Liberation Day lows, the U.S. stock market was up 26% over whatever period of days that was.

So the more expensive the property you live in, the smaller the share of your tax. And I think it's hard to justify that element of it. What's your view on a wealth tax?  Well, I think people mean different things by a wealth tax. I think if you mean a tax on the annual stock of wealth, then I think it's not where I would go, basically. I think it's got problems in principle. It basically taxes wealth the longer you hold it. It discourages saving and investment.  And in practical terms, the government is not currently valuing all wealth. It would be a really big thing to get this off the ground and administer it. What I think we should do is look at the taxes we already have on wealth, so capital gains being a great example, and fix those. And again, that's a great example where we have lower rates of tax on capital gains. But at the same time, because of how we design the tax reliefs, we'd mostly discourage investment in risk taking.

And yet with SpaceX, I think interestingly, you know, for them to have just pumped two billion into XAI, I think there's a little bit of FOMO on the part of some in the Tesla shareholder base where they've seen, you know, XAI go from, you know, not all that valuable a startup to suddenly, you know, an extremely valuable startup.

Which is kind of fascinating, because of course that didn't work out too well for GE, and yet even some of Musk's own allies have sort of alluded to viewing him and his empire as sort of a modern-day General Electric.  He did take pains to say on NX that he does not support a full-blown merger of Tesla and XAI, but he has signaled on there multiple times now that he would be in favor of Tesla putting money in.  That's, of course, a proposition that could be helpful if XAI continues to grow its valuation.

You've got a good point, Paul. Private label has been consistently growing and got a huge bump since the pandemic. And part of that is that the retailers have really invested in the quality and the differentiation of those private label brands. So where consumers now really consider them not just a replacement for national brands, but in some instances, just regular brands of their own right.  And so, you know, Kraft Heinz actually had reduced some of its exposure to private label when they sold off the planters business, when they sold off the cheese, like the shredded cheese business with Kraft. But the core grocery business, they do still have a lot of exposure to private label. So is this a lot of competition from, let's say, startup food companies appealing to younger consumers? I mean, what kind of sparked this?  Well, there's really been a shift in the way consumers are looking at brands. And unless you own a long legacy brand that you can reinvent and really drive interest from younger generations, it's really hard to keep that going. And so what we've seen is that they've done a good job with revitalizing things like Philly cream cheese.  But despite a lot of investment, brands like Capri Sun, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House, these brands just aren't resonating with younger consumers. And that means that the growth prospects for those brands are a lot lower. And that makes it hard to really bill yourself as a growth-type oriented company."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 590.191, "text": "So I know, as I think back to my M&A memory banks 10 years ago, Kraft and Heinz  Berkshire Hathaway had a big hand in putting these two companies together and look now they're still the largest shareholder with just under 28% of the stock.

I mean, over time, Berkshire Hathaway has actually done quite well out of this deal, even though Kraft Heinz as an overall entity is probably disappointed in the overall analysis. But the merger was in 2015. It's been 10 years. The value of the deal at the time in 2015 was $45 billion. Today's market cap, it's $32 billion. And yes, they've sold off a couple of brands.  It just hasn't materialized to be the type of growth that I think Berkshire Hathaway initially envisioned it would happen. Jennifer, can you dig more into some of the advantages but also the risks associated with breaking up the company?  Obviously, some of the advantages, and this seems very similar to what Kellogg did when they spun Kellanova and WK Kellogg out into two separate companies. They separated the growth prospects and then those from the slow growth areas. That's very similar to what Kraft Heinz seems to be doing. Obviously, if you can focus on growth areas, that gives you undivided attention to really expand and grow.  That would be an advantage. I think one of the disadvantages, and this is something that's kind of a broader question to consider, is whether there's a cycle that's starting. Because we've seen companies like Kelinova split. We see Unilever spinning off their ice cream business. And those new entities are now being bought up by others. So you've got Mars acquiring Kelinova. You have Ferrero acquiring WK Kellogg.  But in order to get regulatory approval, you have to have categories that aren't overlapping. And so you're seeing a new birth of new kind of conglomerates of dissimilar portfolios. And so it makes me wonder if we're setting up another cycle where in another five years, 10 years, we're going to see these companies that have been buying up the underperforming brands going through a similar type of activity."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 731.292, "text": " What's driving all this?

We were running at about 25% of the proper level of munitions order. In other words, when we needed four, we ordered one.  When you do that over 20 years, you really create a deficit. And worse, you tell the defense industrial based companies, I'm not going to do major orders. And they reduce their ability to produce. So what you've seen over the last three years are pretty consistent from the supplemental, the Ukraine supplemental, Taiwan supplemental,  a couple of years ago, this year's budget and next year's budget, actual investments in the defense industrial base, where the United States is contributing to defense industrial base companies like Lockheed and Raytheon and Northrop Grumman to expand their ability, their capacity to produce, they obviously contribute.

Iran has built a Shaheed drone factory in  Russia, after giving them thousands of their own Shaheed drones or selling them, they now have a factory there producing it. That's what's hammering the Ukrainian cities every night. And the third thing is China has been backstopping the economy with increases in imports and exports, but equally importantly, providing the microelectronics that are used in Russian cruise and ballistic missiles. So all three of these countries, this axis of authoritarians, are supporting the fourth  Russia in this fight. And that's who Ukraine's been going against.

And this is a big problem, and it's a big problem for our defense industrial sector that really can't produce enough.

We are trying to develop close ties with India. We see India as a strong potential partner vis-a-vis China. And we've also been reticent in some ways to go after a number of Chinese banks and other Chinese entities. So I think, you know, with this tariff play, we'll see.  It could have real ramifications, I think, for Russia's oil sector, but it would also have real implications for the United States bilateral relations. And the thing we have to remember is part of what the Biden administration was trying to do was to keep Russian oil on the global market.  We wanted Russia to take a haircut in terms of how much profit it was getting in terms of sales, but we didn't really have a problem with Russia selling oil. We just wanted it to sell it at a haircut because we wanted Russian oil on the market to keep global prices low.

And the Saudis, I don't think were willing to. But with Trump, maybe it's different. I think the bigger, broader question here, though,  is that Trump has not shown a lot of interest in trying to really stick it to the Russians, economically or militarily. He has not demonstrated in the past a lot of support for Ukraine. If that is shifting, the question is how far does that shift? I think what we've seen is a partial shift.  The U.S. now looks like it's going to continue military supplies, but there's no indication Trump is going to go to Congress, try to ramp up our production for Ukraine. And then the economic question is, how much of an economic hit is the president willing to absorb to stick it to the Russians in support of Ukraine? There's limits to what the Biden administration would do.  So I do have some doubts about how far we are willing to go. And I think Russia may just try to call our bluff here. And it'll be really interesting when the 50 or 60 days expire, whether that prompts sort of a strong US reaction.

So this is more than a 10-year vision. We wanted to do this, and we wanted to go big in this market. So we had a commitment, and we started in Reno, Nevada. And this is our factory that we're diversifying our EV strategy. And we're going to be full production this year. And it's really exciting. Today's a fun and exciting day, and this is a celebration.  full production this year, so cells are already coming off the line."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 119.719, "text": "Yes."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 120.06, "text": "Could you just explain the roadmap for the ramp because no facility is straightforward, but this is the size of 200 American football fields. How are you going to get to full capacity this year? So we started in November 2022, two and a half years ago, and it was all flat field and it was a massive land and we started the construction and we started the production.  and testing last week and we're going to produce the batteries this year and you probably saw the cars that we have in display and Tesla Lucid and Hexagon truck and we're really excited to work with different suppliers and partners and clients this year.  We're going to discuss in detail those customers. They're really key to this. There were media reports Friday night that there would be a delay in reaching full capacity. And what the report stated was that was due to demand. Are you able to comment on that report? And it sounds like they were misinformed if you are going to hit full capacity this year.  I do think it was misinformed, and we're a Japanese company, and when we say, when we commit to something, we're fully committed, and we want to make sure that we support all the customers that were committed. We're not feeling the slowdown yet, and we're very bullish on working with all those customers.  When you say you're not feeling the slowdown, that means that you're seeing consistent orders from those key customers or they're still committing to orders in advance. What do you mean by the definition of what you just said? So we have the operation in Reno and that's going very healthy and we're seeing the commitments coming in for this facility as well. So we're not feeling the  slow down yet. But yet again, I mean, you see this operation, this is a long-term commitment. So there may be some pushback or moving ahead, but we're committed for a long term and we're not shying away from those from time to time challenges.  Throughout the morning there was a lot of discussion about Tesla because Tesla makes the best-selling EV model in the world. This specific facility, does Tesla dominate the proportion of output or is it more evenly split across your different customers? So we're working with Tesla for sure and we're working with Lucid and Hexagon and other clients. So it is to diversify our EV manufacturing in the United States.  What do you mean by diversify, move away from one sort of core customer? No, not really. We're expanding, right? So we're definitely working with Tesla, but we want to work with other established OEMs as well as startups. So it's part of our efforts to expand our strategy and manufacturing output as well. What signals has Tesla given you about its future orders, about the health of its business?  Your guess is as good as mine. But we have a long-term relationship, longer than anyone else. And they're still a very important strategic partner for us. And I believe our partnership is very strong.  Throughout the morning, there was a lot of discussion of how Kansas was the absolute best candidate. What were the biggest factors in choosing this site? Were they financial? Were they simply the ability to get things done? Lack of red tape? Why were you able to move so quickly?  So we talked about the available workforce and the infrastructure. I mean, you saw the power lines built by the factory and as well as the energy procurement that we can do. But more than anything, there was something very special about Kansas.  All the officials were able to work with us, and you probably heard that Lieutenant Governor Toland making some of his speech in not only Japanese, but in Osaka dialect. And that level of insight and care and support really made a difference. And it doesn't matter what party they are, they're very committed to bring us here, but also make us feel home.  So that kind of partnership, not just numbers and infrastructure, but emotional partnership made the difference. And we're so happy to celebrate today. What I was going to say on the numbers is there is a job creation story. So 4,000 direct jobs. I think the number is 20,000 indirect jobs when you take into account supply chain, construction.  What have you had to do to kind of bring the other infrastructure you've needed to DeSoto, have everything you need around you? So what was great about planning it out, like I said, we started two and a half years ago, and at that time we worked with local schools and community colleges to create curriculums.  So when we start for manufacturing, they are there ready, already taking the courses and be available to take a job here. To guarantee you have the skill sets that you needed? Absolutely, absolutely. So we created curriculum together and it's been a really good partnership and it helps us and it helps the community and it's like wonderful win-win.  The headline figure was that Panasonic put $4 billion into this DeSoto facility, but you were also, the reported number is eligible for almost $7 billion from the inflation reduction act. How much of that materialized?  We haven't started the manufacturing here, so we have not seen the incentives yet. They're set against milestones. Yes, yes. So it comes with the production, so we're looking forward to it, and it's definitely a big part of our investment. Do you anticipate that you will get access to the full tranche of money?  We certainly hope so. Things have changed. I mean, things have changed even since you and I spoke in January. There is some effort underway to reshape or undo the Inflation Reduction Act. It seems like the $7,500 credit which goes to the consumer of the vehicle will go, but the 45x manufacturer credit seems intact. How have you navigated that? Is that your read on the scenario as well?  So we're still very hopeful that it should remain, and I think it should remain. It's not only for us, but it's for creating jobs and manufacturing and bringing technology to the U.S. So, so far it's very positive, and we're hopeful that it stays. It will be a big part of our long-term strategy.  What's the supply chain story right now for DeSoto, Kansas? When you think about your raw material needs and everything that goes into the sale process, are there things that are still difficult? What are they? Or has bringing this facility online been smoother because of policy?  We have been planning for the supply chain resilience not just for this and recent tariff situation but from COVID. During COVID we really suffered from weak supply chain. I mean I think all the industry did and so did we. So we've been planning for supply chain resilience.  And we are, I mean just for our benefit too, to make sure that those supply chains stay local and within the North America. And our goal is to complete 50% of our supply chain by 2030 to be completely local.  Are any of the conditions currently associated with that 45x manufacturer credit difficult when you think about foreign entity of concern or parts of the supply chain, which in the context of metals, China is still a factor here? Yes.  So, we started partnering with China for the supply chain resilience. We are trying to diversify and make sure the supply chain is more resilient to make sure that we can procure and process on site. So, it's not really a new change for us necessarily. We've been trying to do that for a few years. Where are the bottlenecks right now, if any?  I don't know. It's really the refining process to make sure that we can find a supplier who can make sure that the quality is there, right? The refinement, the quality matters for our quality production. So that's where we pay most attention to make sure that the raw material is ready for quality EV batteries, right? It's good for everyone. For consumers, we want to make sure those EV batteries are tested and safe.  I know this might seem far-fetched, we are just bringing this facility online, but one of the questions I got from you from the audience is what happens next? You have Nevada, you now have Kansas. Does Panasonic see further sites? For EV in the first instance, what is your next priority?  It's TBD. Today's the first day of this operation, and we're really excited to make sure that this goes smooth, producing quality EV batteries. We'll focus on that first, and if it goes well, who knows, right?  Demand is still a question. What I find interesting is a lot of the customer base is pure plate EV, but the lesson we've learned in the last 18 months or so is hybrid is still a big part of the market. Maybe in a way that surprised many. Do you have the ability to tap into demand for hybrid from this facility or others?  We don't know yet, but we're pleasantly surprised that EV sales still rose by like 11.4%. So that's a good sign. And like I said, this is a long-term play. So we're not going to be happy and sad with the small ups and downs. We're still bullish that EV markets should grow and hybrid transition should be part of it.  Have you done a sort of side-by-side analysis of the economics of a single cell? Bring mine back out. I have one single 2170 cell here. So this will be manufactured in Kansas, not subject to tariffs. You have the Nevada facility, but Panasonic Energy also has facilities all around the world. Is it just an instant fix that the cell on a unit basis  It's just a more attractive economic proposition if it's built here in Kansas for the American market versus shipping sales in from your overseas facilities. It makes a lot more economic sense to produce here, right? Bring raw materials here and produce here.  And we're cutting in for some breaking news here. We have President Trump in the White House with the NATO secretary-general. Take a listen. That was President Trump with the NATO secretary-general announcing that he was, quote, unhappy with Russia and is threatening secondary tariffs of 100 percent on Russia if a deal with Ukraine is not reached.  But first, let's get to some breaking news that crossed the wire. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's CEO, took to threads to say that the company will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in computing to build superintelligence. Shares rose off the news, and let's get right to that with our very own Kurt Wagner.

He's even admitted  Some companies, presumably his own, will overpay on AI in order not to fall behind. So hundreds of billions on infrastructure. But I think, Jackie, when you look at this, why it makes sense is you recall over these last couple of weeks, they've been spending very aggressively to hire AI talent for this superintelligence group. And I think this commitment to the infrastructure side is meant to sort of go hand in hand with that. OK, so we've hired the talent.

We've talked about this historically on this show before, this idea that all of Elon Musk's various businesses sort of work together and help one another. And I think that's just become more and more prevalent.  especially as XAI has grown. And so we learned that SpaceX, for example, is now investing $2 billion into XAI. We've seen that Elon Musk plans to put a shareholder vote to Tesla shareholders asking if Tesla should invest in XAI. We obviously know XAI and Twitter already merged or X already merged. So this notion that all of these different sort of  businesses of Elon's are now contributing to the AI business, I think is super notable. And you can see there are some, you know, to use the terrible cliche, synergies between these companies, right? The idea that Grok might be distributed through Teslas is one example of that. But it does feel like Elon is saying, okay, I have these other businesses that are doing well financially. I'm gonna take some of that cash and try to use that as jet fuel on my AI startup."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 939.614, "text": " Kurt, it really depends on the outcome of this shareholder vote.

So you have a pretty strong base of people. But for those who are on the fence, I think what you would sit here and say is, look, this technology, this AI technology is going to be world changing, transforming if it hasn't, you know.  already been the case with self-driving, for example, being maybe the core Tesla example. And so I think if you're Elon, you just say, look, you're putting in money now into a technology that's going to be worth 10, 100 times more down the line, but also you're going to get all of this data, this infrastructure that I'm building at XAI, and it could  could potentially benefit Tesla as well, again, as you improve self-driving, as you take Grok, for example, put it into the cars. So if I'm him, I paint this as very much like a rosy marriage between the future technology and putting all of that into an automobile, which I think they're already doing. So I think it's easy for people to wrap their heads around, but it's something he's going to have to really hammer home for those who are skeptical."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1014.995, "text": " Kurt we know that Bloomberg has reported that XAI is burning over a billion dollars a month on its A.I. efforts.

Thanks for joining us. Coming up, Lucid Interim CEO Mark Winterhoff joins us from the Panasonic EV battery plant in Kansas. More next. This is Bloomberg Tech.  Welcome back to Bloomberg Tech. We're live in DeSoto, Kansas, at Panasonic's brand new EV battery plant, 4.7 million square feet, at full capacity, which will happen later this year. Some news we broke with Panasonic's North America CEO, Megan Myung-Won Lee, 30 gigawatt hours of capacity. That's enough cells for 500,000 EVs per annum. One of the key customers, Lucid, and Lucid CEO Mark Winterhoff, interim CEO Mark Winterhoff, is with us now.  This is a significant moment for you as well, because it's your first domestic supply of cells. Reflect on that. That is true. Currently, we're getting our battery supplies either from Japan or from Korea, depending on the supplier. And Panasonic is a great partner for us. We decided two and a half years ago to make together this investment here and to localize the production, the cell production here to Canada.  It's not just volume supply. This is 2170, but my understanding is there was some co-engineering to make this as good as it can possibly be. Explain how that works. It's a great collaboration between our engineering departments and their engineering department. We bring in a lot of experience on what the cell is supposed to do in real life, and they make it happen with chemistry and with all of the parameters of the cell.  So it was really, really great collaboration. And that we also then are able now to produce this here locally, obviously in the current climate, helps us a lot.  How did the economics of the De Soto Candace May 2170 stack? I know that you love charts and spreadsheets as much as I do, but you must have done that analysis. Oh yeah, absolutely. What's it like? I would say we wouldn't have done it if it wouldn't be economically feasible or beneficial.  As I mentioned before, we made that decision not just recently. So tariffs were not on the radar screen at that time. We did that decision two and a half years ago. And at that time, together with the 45x incentive tax credit, the economics make sense. I still have to say, and I hope that Panasonic hears that, that there's some room of improvement. But also right now, obviously with the tariffs, this is a very good move for us.  because the same cell that would otherwise have come from Japan or Korea is subject to tariffs. It is. That's a part of the equation. That is correct. And the other thing that we are currently working on together with Panasonic is obviously further localizing the supply chain for the cell, because it doesn't do you a lot of good if you manufacture here, but you still import the raw material, which is then subject to tariffs.  So, we're already doing a lot of investments in that. You heard about our Graphite One investments on the graphite and other materials. So, we're working with them on making that happen as well. Mark, I've covered Lucid for a number of years. This is the first time you and I have spoken and I'm grateful for your time. Your predecessor, Peter Robinson, had a very simple argument. Lucid had the best technology on the hardware side and software battery management system.  And even though your journey started in the premium segments, that you would scale to volume because you would just say, this performance and range in this pack, we can just scale it down, make a more affordable version. Have we hit that inflection point yet?  Well, I mean, we're about to. You know, everybody knows by now that follows Lucid that, you know, we are very, very strongly working on our midsize platform. Right. Which is a, you know, smaller platform also from a price point perspective, more in the round in the $50,000 range and not where we are right now.  And that's when we really hit that inflection point. But with the gravity that we are ramping up right now, we are already expecting to have much higher numbers than we had in the past. Right. I think, you know, there's a lot of work to do in the second half of the year to reach 20,000.  What role does the DeSoto plant play? Will you be able to get hold of sales from here for vehicles sold or delivered in this calendar year? No, not yet. That is something for next year and again with our partners with Panasonic we are working on opportunities to further bring this in because obviously in the current climate that is very important for us to localize.  We've focused this morning a lot on policy. You brought up the 45x credit, but the consumer credit of $7,500, likely no more. What can you do in that environment with the vehicle? Are you able to pull forward lower price point variants? Are you looking to just appeal to the premium segment on an ongoing basis?  Well, first of all, when it comes to our current vehicles with the AIR, it might not be widely known, but we are the best-selling vehicle in our segment, the best-selling EV. And we also were in the second half of last year. Actually, no, in the beginning of this year, we were the best-selling vehicle in the whole segment, including ICE vehicles. So the AIR is actually doing well, although the numbers are obviously, when you look at the broader scheme of things, are not that high yet. But that's because of the size of the segment. Right.  With gravity, obviously we're now reaching a different scale, and we're still ramping up the production, and as you said, we have to do quite a lot in order to get to our target for this year, but it's going well. We're unclocking some of the blockages that we had in the supply chain, and our plant really got into the groove to create the vehicle.  So I would say the inflection point of having really economics of scale is still a little bit out. We're still more appealing to the higher price segment, that's what we have. And I mean, in automotive, you cannot just decide, oh, let's put out a new, cheaper variant next week. It takes years to implement, to plan, to engineer, to validate. So that's sometimes not well understood.  Manufacturing and building great cars is a long-term game. And you have to build also economics of scale over time. It's not something that happens from one day to the other. But I'll hold you to it. 20,000 is realistic this year with the time left to you. We're in a quiet period right now, so I cannot really talk about it. I suggest you tune in in our earnings call on August 5th. I will do. And you will definitely hear about it.  and the mid-sized platform is on track for next year. And the same applies to that as well. We're working very hard but on August 5th there will be news on that. The other part of Lucid's history was the idea of partnerships, manufacturing partnerships, licensing technology. Has that idea changed given the political environment?  No, actually, no, it hasn't. So as a matter of fact, and I said that in the last couple of months, and everybody honestly, understandably asked me, okay, where is it? Where is it? Again, those things take time. And particularly in the last couple of months with the uncertainty of the terrorists, I have to say,  Many of the people we had conversations with, they have other issues. They have pressing things to solve right now in the last quarter. We also on top of that had the magnet shortage, which actually halted production for several players. So those discussions still happen on our EV core technology. But also beyond that, stay tuned, there will be other news also coming.  Are those potential partners motivated by the environment, the effort to onshore industry in this country to work with American companies? There are different things. First of all, right now with the perceived slowdown of EV adoption,  especially companies that have both ICE vehicles and EVs, they can only invest the dollar once. So, right now we see, let's say, shift back to ICE vehicles, and therefore, but they still need to come out with new models, and therefore we have increased interest in, hey, can we do things together? And I expect this to continue, actually.  You talked a moment ago about being dominant in your segment, the lead seller in that segment. But everyone always asks me, if somebody is put off buying a Tesla vehicle, I drive a Tesla vehicle, a Model Y, but there are many out there that say, I don't want to buy a Tesla vehicle. Have you any data that says those buyers turn to Lucid in the pure play categories that you operate in?  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, as I just said, we're now the best selling vehicle in the United States in our segment. That includes the Model S, our segment. I mean, I don't compare right now the gravity because we're still ramping up. We're in the phase of ramping up. I guess let's talk again by the end of this year where we stand on the gravity. But the air, yes, we see a lot of incoming. We always actually, by the way, had a lot of interest from Tesla buyers. That's not really new.  But it has increased. Absolutely. This administration is fascinating in Lucid's context. Maybe the pro-EV policy is not there, but supporting U.S. manufacturers is. You also have the relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the administration in the context of GPUs, for example, has been supportive in those trade deals. What has the experience been like leading this company under the Trump administration? And net-net, how do you think you've come out so far?  Well, I mean, obviously things became more complicated. I mean, the tariff situation, I mean, there's no doubt it increases our cost. And it also creates a lot of additional headache, because you now have to completely rethink the supply chain. Are you continuing certain things, or are you localizing? Again, that's nothing that happens from one day to the other. We are doing okay.  when you compare to other players in the industry, also from the cost increases, particularly because we build everything right now in the United States. We build all of the vehicles, our key components, they're all built here in the United States. Having said that,  We are hit by obviously raw materials or let's say tier two suppliers that we have to import and we have to pay tariffs on that. So it's not that we are not impacted but we are less so than others. So yeah I mean it's something we have to work with.  And for us, it's also because we are a pure EV manufacturer. We believe in the future of electrical propulsion. We're not wavering. We're not saying, oh, let's do, I don't know, a range extender or something. That's not going to happen with Lucid. This is part of our vision, you know, that this is the future and actually important to save our planet. So we will find a way through this, but also I have to say,  For the American consumers, vehicles are going to be more expensive under the tariff regime. There's no other way around it. Yes, you can say, oh, you just need to localize. Well, yes, but that still increases the costs, because there's a reason why the supply chain is so global, because certain things are either not available here in the US or are just very expensive, so you import them. And if you change that, you still have higher costs here in the United States, which means  Manufacturers like us, or actually any manufacturer, has to increase prices. There's no other way, unless you want everybody to be non-profit organizations, which then would lead to no innovation, no technology leadership, and I think that's, in the current climate globally, it's the last thing we want.  The cost of doing business in America. Mark Winterhoff, Lucid's interim CEO, one of the core customers at this Panasonic DeSoto Kansas plant that is due to hit full capacity this year.

And it's not good news. See, it turns out that when Donald Trump said he was going to fight for working-class Americans, what he really meant  was he was going to take away your health care to cut taxes for the rich. That's what he really meant. Now, you may remember we were told that this was a different Republican Party. We were told Donald Trump's new GOP cared about working people. But Savannah,  Savannah, you can't claim to be for working men and women when you defund their hospitals and nursing homes. You can't claim to be for working men and women when you defund school lunch programs to help feed little boys and little girls whose hard-working parents are struggling to fill the fridge.  You definitely can't claim to be for working men and women when you do these things so you can cut taxes for the richest people in the country. Now there was a Republican senator with the integrity to oppose this. Tom Tillis of North Carolina. Did y'all see that? He was on the Senate floor. He was pleading with Republicans to do the right thing.  Senator Tillis warned that 663,000 North Carolinians will be pushed off Medicaid. He warned that President Trump was breaking his promises. He took a stand and he voted against the bill and they ran him right out of the Republican Party for it. Now it took courage what Senator Tillis did.  But among the Republicans who represent Georgia in Congress, no such courage was to be found. Just, yes, sir, no, sir, Mr. Trump. Now, let me tell you. Let me just tell you what it was like in Washington these last six months.  See, we had the leaders of Georgia's clinics and hospitals and nursing homes, caregivers for seniors and the disabled, nurses and doctors, teachers and school principals, the folks who run food pantries, they all came up to Washington and they begged Georgia's representatives in Congress. They said, please don't do this. They said it's gonna be devastating for healthcare and kids and seniors. And I want you to know, but Senator Warnock and I, we listened.  We listened. And we fought that bill with everything we have, and we voted no. We put Georgia first, Savannah. But every single Republican member of Congress who is supposed to represent Georgia, who is supposed to put loyalty to Georgia as their highest priority,  Instead, they chose loyalty to Donald Trump. Think about this. They're destroying the Medicaid program when 40% of all kids in Georgia are covered by Medicaid. 50% of all births, 50% of all births in Georgia are covered by Medicaid. 70% of all seniors in nursing homes in Georgia are covered by Medicaid.  There are now 37 Georgia nursing homes at risk of closure because of this law, and seven of them are less than two hours from where we are right now. Do you all remember what Donald Trump said about Medicaid? He said, we're not going to touch it. We're not going to touch it. Direct quote. It's like Senator Tillis said, a broken promise, and one of many.  President Trump promised to end the wars. He promised to release the Epstein files. Did anyone really think the sexual predator president who used to party with Jeffrey Epstein was going to release the Epstein files?  So many broken promises."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker criticises the Republican Party for passing a bill that cuts taxes for the wealthy by defunding essential healthcare programs like Medicaid, school lunch programs, hospitals, and nursing homes.

We've got some very, very, very special guests with us today. Really exciting announcement. So glad to have so many wonderful people. And how about all of this ice cream here in Washington, D.C. ?  First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you for being here today. It's obviously a bit of a toasty, humid day here in Washington, which is normal for July. But for you guys who are all out braving the weather to celebrate today, we're just so grateful. A very special thank you to our Agricultural Marketing Service dairy team. Where's our USDA team?  Oh, look at those wonderful people over there. Thank you, guys. It's kind of like y'all's Super Bowl. Yes, and you guys have won it. I love it. I'm also so excited to be joined by my dear, dear friend and partner. How about Secretary Bobby Kennedy of HHS? We also have the extraordinary FDA Commissioner, Dr. Marty McCary.  Day, Marty. And then we have some incredible people you'll get to hear from, from the actual dairy industry. First, the president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association, Michael Dykes. Next, the president of Turkey Hill Dairy, Andy Jacobs. And finally, an Indiana dairy farmer, Sam Schweppe. So we'll get to hear very briefly from all of these incredible dairy industry and farmers behind me. Please help me welcome them as well.  I really want to say first and foremost how grateful we are at the Department of Agriculture to have the opportunity to partner with Secretary Kennedy and his wonderful team to represent the American agricultural community and to work together to improve the health outcomes of our kids and our families.  We know that our current health outcomes, especially for our children, are unsustainable and that American agriculture is at the heart of the solution to make America healthy again. I don't want to get too far ahead of the big announcement today, but I just want to commend the leadership, Michael and the whole team and everyone you represent at IDFA and all the dairy farmers and ice cream producers they represent  for taking on this voluntary, proactive effort to eliminate the use of artificial colors in ice cream products by the end of 2027.  Because of this historic partnership between USDA and HHS, and I will say it is an unprecedented partnership, but also because of leadership of organizations like IDFA and again all the farmers and producers they represent, we are driving meaningful change to make America healthy again.  I also want to acknowledge a lot of other partners, the Consumer Brands Association, Tyson Foods, PepsiCo, J.M. Smucker, Nestle, Hershey, ConAgra Brands, Kraft Heinz, and General Mills, each of which have recently made similar commitments to remove artificial colors from their products.  Just last week, the Consumer Brands Association announced a voluntary commitment to encourage the makers of America's food and beverage products to remove certified food, drug, and cosmetic colors from products served in our schools by the start of next year's school year, 2026.  The beauty of America is the role that private enterprise has always played, but will continue to play, and perhaps an even bigger role, in voluntarily shaping policies for the good of future generations. Dairy farmers represented by IDFA are certainly embracing that role, and we are  just so grateful. At this time, I'd love to welcome to the podium, again, my partner in this very valid, righteous, and incredible effort. Please help me welcome Secretary Bobby Kennedy."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 264.766, "text": " Thank you, Brooke. I'm particularly happy to be here today because this is relevant to my favorite food, which is ice cream.  I want to, you know, since we've, you know, since we came in about five and a half months ago and started talking about eliminating dyes and other bad chemicals from our food, we've had this extraordinary response from the industry. And Brooke just rattled off this inventory, this extraordinary inventory of national corporate food producers have all made commitments  to remove food dyes from their food. And with this addition today of the dairymen and the dairy food producers, we now have about 35% of American food industry that has made commitments. And that's an addition between 35 and 40%.  And that is in addition to the 35% of the food industry that was already organic and healthy and chemical free. Brooke and I have often talked about the fact that we can't make Maha succeed without the partnership of the American farmer. And our job is to help them to open the doors, to make sure that they have adequate  resources in their supply chains, and that the approvals for new chemical-free dyes are happening very quickly. And I'm going to bring on Marty McCary in a moment.  and he's gonna make an amazing announcement. Today, FDA has approved a new blue vegetable dye, in addition to many of the other dyes that we've, three dyes that we've already rapidly approved over the past two months. So we are gonna be there for the dairy industry. I grew up in a world where  milk was the healthiest thing that you could eat. There's been an attack on whole milk and cheese and yogurt over the past couple of decades, and Brooke and I, our agencies are about to release new dietary guidelines in the next several months that will elevate those products to where they ought to be in terms of contributing to the health of our children. There's a...  There's a tremendous amount of emerging science that talks about the need for more protein in our diet and more fats in our diet. And there's no industry that does that better than this industry.  I'm very grateful for this industry for stepping up, not only on this, but over the past 10 years, they've removed 60% of the sugar from milk products in school lunches. They've pledged to continue to reduce the amount of sugar in the food. This step is an extraordinary step, and I'm very proud to be part of this.  partnership. I'm very, very grateful to the industry. There are many dairy men and women in the audience, and we met with them this morning, and it was an amazing meeting with amazing people. And we want to make it so that they're successful and that they can do what they want to do, which is to provide our children with the healthiest food possible. Now I want to introduce my friend and my colleague, Marty McCary, and I've already ruined his announcement.  Now, thank you, Secretary Kennedy and Secretary Rawlings. We wouldn't be here were it not for both of your vision to make this happen, so thank you. And Secretary Rawlings, you've been the perfect partner in this.  We first said we want to remove all nine petroleum-based food dyes from the U.S. food supply and do it soon. The naysayers said it would not be possible. And here we are weeks later with an announcement that nearly 40 percent of food manufacturers have  raise their hand to say, yes, we agree. There are no Democrat or Republican children in America. They are children. And so we can do this because we now have enough reason to be concerned about these petroleum-based food dyes. We don't need to wait for a 10-year randomized controlled trial. Parents are telling us  that when a kid has abnormal behavior and they try reducing or eliminating petroleum-based food dyes, they have seen behavior improve. That is data. May not be a 10-year randomized controlled trial, but if we listen to parents, there are learnings there for the medical establishment. There are also randomized controlled trials also raising these health concerns with the petroleum-based food dyes.  Now, we believe in options, so that means we want natural dyes to be available to food makers and ice cream makers. Normally, every couple years the FDA will spit out one natural food dye approval. But on the charge of Secretary Kennedy, we have made this a priority, and Kyle Diamantis, who's standing here in charge of the food program at the FDA,  has made this a priority such that in the very short time we have been in office, we have now the fourth natural food dye from natural ingredients approved by the FDA. Today, I'm announcing that the FDA is approving Gardenia Blue as a natural food dye with natural ingredients.  We believe in options and we believe in incremental improvements in health. The sickness of American kids is not a willpower problem. It's not their fault. We can do things that will make the food supply healthier one step at a time.  So with that, I just want to reemphasize that this is a renaissance moment in health in America, and part of that is rewriting the broken food and nutrition guidelines of the United States. No longer are we going to have a broken food pyramid and a continuation of a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat that began with Dr. Ancel Keys.  We are going to have dietary guidelines that are based on science, not based on medical dogma. So with that, I want to say thank you and thanks for giving me a few minutes here."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 698.656, "text": " Thank you, Dr. McCary, another incredible warrior.

So a big shout out to Kyle and the entire team at HHS and USDA and FDA. So thank you.

I want to thank Secretary Raul and Secretary Kennedy for the opportunity to be here today to talk about the IDFA ice cream commitment and to thank all the wonderful people. I see Dana Cole for \u2014 who put hours and hours into it, as well as my team, in organizing this and planning this. So, thank you so much.  I also want to say a thank you to the dairy farmers who traveled from Michigan, Illinois, Idaho, and Indiana to be here with us today. Everything we do in dairy starts with the dairy farmer, from nutrition to delicious. Thank you.  I know what it's like to be on a dairy farm. As a kid having grown up milking cows and as a dairy veterinarian, I've been there. I've seen it. I know your hard work and I know your dedication. So thank you for all you do. This is a unique opportunity for IDFA. We represent the industry, the processing industry.  And we're so happy with this voluntary, industry-led commitment to ensure that our products are on the right side of public policy and on consumer choice. Back in 2022, we made a similar commitment that we would maximize the amount of sugar in flavored milk in schools. And I'm pleased to say that in the last decade, we've reduced sugar 60% in American schools in flavored milk, which is the number one product for children.  Earlier this year, we made a commitment that we would eliminate the certified artificial colors. The company stepped forward that they would eliminate the certified artificial colors in dairy products sold in schools, milk, cheese, and yogurt. Another commitment that our industry stepped forward with a member companies coming for and making those commitments. And today, it's about celebrating ice cream and honoring the history of ice cream in America, but making sure that we continue to offer the products that consumers know and love.  This announcement today represents over 40 individual ice cream companies. It's the single largest effort of its kind, and it's efforts like this that demonstrate how our dairy industry is different. Our dairy industry was built on families.  Processing industries, processing organizations started off on a single farm with a creamery and years and years and generations later, they've grown into major companies. It is the dedication, it's the hard work, it's the commitment that  Our industry is committed to doing right and serving nutritious, healthy products to all. So, on behalf of all of them, I am grateful to be here today. I'm grateful to our IDFA members, all of our ice cream companies, all of the dairy farmers, and to Secretary Rawlings and Secretary Kennedy for being such staunch champions of dairy. Thank you.

I am Andy Jacobs, Chair of the IDFA Ice Cream Board and Chief Executive Officer of Turkey Hill Dairy, one of the nation's premier ice cream brands.  Today's announcement represents a commitment by dozens of individual ice cream companies from small independent companies to family owned companies going back generations to large multinationals. We have all come together as the ice cream industry to lead  major change and to make this commitment to remove artificial colors. And you may ask, why are we taking this action today? There are three good reasons. First, many of the commercial ice cream manufacturers have already phased out certified artificial colors, and many others are currently working with suppliers to phase them out as quickly as possible. Second, by taking this step now,  Ice cream manufacturers are ensuring that ice cream remains a special part of our lives as consumer preferences change and the nation's regulatory priorities evolve. As ice cream makers, we want to ensure families continue to enjoy their favorite wholesome ice cream treat. And third, this is about showing consumers and our communities that we are stepping up. We know that Americans eat roughly 19 pounds of ice cream a year.  Think about that. We also know that ice cream is important to our dairy farmers, our ice cream making communities, and our food retail partners. U.S. ice cream contributes almost $12 billion to the U.S. economy and supports over 27,000 dairy industry jobs. We want to ensure that we continue these bonds with our consumers and, more importantly, to grow our impact on the economy.

Thank you very much to Secretary Rollins and Secretary Kennedy for the opportunity to speak today about my favorite dairy treat, ice cream, and about my family's dairy. I also want to thank the other dairy farmers who are here with me today. For families like ours, ice cream is much more than just a treat or a dessert. It's how we make our living and how we support our families and our communities.  My name is Sam Schweppe and my family owns and operates Schweppe Dairy, a fifth generation dairy in Huntingburg, Indiana, where our family has been nourishing our community since 1874.  We're part of the Prairie Farms Dairy Cooperative, where I serve on the board of directors alongside other farmer owners. With grown sons who do the daily operations on our farm, I also work off the farm for Fresh Connect Central, which is a social enterprise arm of Gleaners Food Bank in Indianapolis, and that is a member of the Feeding America Network.  I've lived on an operating dairy my entire life. And growing up, my parents were foster parents, and I personally observed the importance of good nutrition and the transformation it can make in a human being. I'll never forget one of my brothers arriving to our family at the age of nine with gray hair, bald patches on his head, and skin flaking off of his body due to a lack of nutrition.  After one month of regular meals, including the dense nutrition provided by whole milk and dairy products, and of course, our regular weekend ice cream parties, he transformed into a little freckle-faced, red-headed boy, and this memory is core to my mission to feed children.  As identified by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, milk contains many of the nutrients of public health concern, including calcium, vitamin D, and potassium, and, of course, protein. These nutrients are often under-consumed in the United States population, and they're linked to various health issues. It is essential we consume good, wholesome food products. That is what we're here to say today and to promise to America.  Products containing real dairy are the most nutritious options. And even though ice cream is decadent and has calories, it sure beats the heck out of candy and soda pop for a sweet treat. Because ice cream is also packed with nutrients, and it's made from real wholesome milk, and it delivers a powerful nutrient package.  So I'm just inviting everyone here, let's all join in the spirit and make sweet great again and enjoy some ice cream. I really appreciate you including the farmer's voice in today's events and we at Prairie Farms are pleased to join this commitment along with dozens of other ice cream makers and dairy farmers across the United States of America.

We have the highest healthcare cost of any country in the world, and we have the sickest population.  And one of the reasons for that is the food that we're eating. And we know that many diabetes cases can lose their more than half, can lose their diagnosis simply by changing their diet. And so this administration wants to encourage Americans to take control of their own health, to eat right,  to have lifestyle changes that save us all.

Medicaid is bankrupting almost every state. It's taking between 30, 40, 45, 50 percent of the state budgets and has for a really long time. For those of us who come from state policy, we know this very, very well. But one of the focuses of myself and Secretary Kennedy is changes to the SNAP program, which y'all have been great at covering.  But the fact that the number one purchase of taxpayer dollars in the SNAP program, which that, with a few other nutrition programs at USDA, spends $405 million a day, when the number one purchase item in there is sugary drinks and junk food, frankly, we have to make a change. So there is a lot of wholesale across the government that we can do, but there's also a recognition that a lot of these communities that are part of the Medicaid program, they don't always have access to healthy food.  So we have to do a better job through our nutrition programs, through our partnerships, et cetera, of ensuring that those communities have access to healthy foods that can make the choices that Dr. Oz, I believe, very articulately outlined.

The medical establishment locked arms and walked off a cliff together, insisting that the reason for heart disease in the United States was that people were not eating skim milk and no fat and low fat foods, ignoring the roles of refined carbohydrates and so many other things that drive general body inflammation, which is the precursor of fat deposition in the arteries.

On top of that,  Donald Trump and House Republicans jam this extreme budget bill down the throats of the American people.

However, I think transparency and sunlight for the American people is always the better course of action.  Democrats in the Senate have been working incredibly hard to push back aggressively against Donald Trump's extreme agenda. We partnered closely with Senate Democrats under the leadership of Chuck Schumer to strongly and uniformly oppose Donald Trump's one big ugly bill. And I'm confident that Senate Republicans will continue  to rubber stamp Donald Trump's extreme judicial choices, and Senate Democrats will continue to aggressively push back on behalf of the American people. This whole situation that America has found itself in over the last six-plus months has been one big corrupt, chaotic, and cruel project  that has been unleashed on the American people and it continues. I mean this Texas thing shouldn't surprise anyone because despite the claims by house Republican leaders that the American people have fallen in love with these extremists in the house of representatives and so they're acting upon a mandate. Give me a break. The only reason  The only reason that House Republicans even have a majority right now is because they stole three seats from the people of North Carolina. North Carolina is a 50-50 state. Donald Trump narrowly won the state in 2024. There's a Democratic governor, a Democratic lieutenant governor, a Democratic attorney general, Democratic elected officials across the state  of North Carolina who won on the same day. North Carolina is a 50-50 state. The North Carolina Congressional Delegation, which previously had fair congressional lines, produced a 50-50 congressional delegation. Seven Democrats, seven Republicans, as recently as January 2nd of this year. That was the makeup of the North Carolina Congressional Delegation. What happened?  Republicans engaged in mid-decade redistricting in a 50-50 state that had fair maps and produced an evenly divided delegation, and took it from 7-7, stole three seats that were in Democratic hands from the people of North Carolina as a result of illegitimate mid-decade congressional gerrymandering, and turned that delegation into 10 Republicans and four Democrats.  There's a three seat difference in the House of Representatives right now when Republicans are at full strength and Democrats are at full strength. 220 Republicans to 215 Democrats. That entire difference, the majority that Republicans have can be explained solely by the fact that they cheated in North Carolina. These people have zero credibility.  in terms of the issues that they're allegedly championing on behalf of the American people. If you believed in your ideas and the power of your issues, then why are you trying to cheat now in Texas, just like you did in North Carolina? The problem that Republicans confront is that the Texas congressional map is already gerrymandered.  And so this gerrymander may actually turn into a dummy-mander because they are going to create a situation where four, five, six, seven, eight Republicans who are currently in safe districts are going to be on the front line of our efforts to flip seats, particularly in a midterm election where Donald Trump is deeply unpopular and his signature one big ugly bill.  is deeply unpopular. Imagine a group of people, this is how corrupt they are, who in the middle of a search and rescue operation that is taking place in Texas right now, dozens of children drowned to death. Some of that has to do with incompetence in the Texas state government and incompetence in the Trump administration.  And instead of actually trying to be there for the people of Texas and the hill country, children at summer camp, who's lost their lives, they call a special session. And the main reason for that special session is to try to steal the midterm elections by rigging the Texas congressional map. These people are complete and total embarrassment.  The American people are not going to stand for it. And things aren't going to get better for them. Politically, they're only going to get worse.

As you enter into the building where I work with Bobby Kennedy and other leaders at the Health and Human Services, there's a quote on the side of the wall. It's from Hubert Humphrey, and it says, it is the moral obligation of government, and we honor this,  to take care of those at the dawn of their life, the children, those at the twilight of their life, the elderly, and those living in the shadows. Folks with handicaps, originally it was called blind, disabled. So those are the populations Medicaid was designed for. 60 years ago this month, by the way, it's having its birthday, and it's the backbone of the social support system, the safety net system of the country. We have to keep it viable.  And what happened over the last few years is a complete perversion of that mission, a destruction of its core purpose that led to its being at risk of bankruptcy. We would have spent $5.4 trillion more dollars instead of the $200 billion that we actually did put into it. So I'll say that again. We would have put a ton of money into it that would have bankrupted the system. Instead, we wisely put more money in, $200 billion.  But then, one step further, and under the President's guidance, we actually fixed the fraud, waste, and abuse. Specifically, work requirements, which is what they're talking about. When the program was created 60 years ago, it never daunted anyone that you would take able-bodied individuals who could work and put them on Medicaid. Today, the average able-bodied person on Medicaid doesn't work. They watch 6.1 hours of television or just hang out.  That's not fair. No, go out and try to get a job. They argue that we can't do it. They're arguing against the competency of the American people and their government. I would make the argument that if I offer you a deal, I'll give you free health insurance, but you got to get off your tail and go try to go to work. You'll take the deal.

Then you can see another staircase. That's how it does. It's a staircase of flowing water that just builds and builds and builds and builds. There's always things you can do. There's always warnings you can give. There's always more that could have been done. And this being the 4th of July weekend,  They should've been up on their game, on top of their game.

Stocks are at an all time high.  He's pressing his bet to be able to get a better deal ahead of those August 1st deadlines. I mean, the EU, US, they're not very far off in terms of what they need to agree to get some sort of deal done. So I do think that the market's looking at this as a way to put some pressure to get some of these deals over the finish line in the final couple of weeks.  And by the way, it may not happen, Kelly. And if it did, you get a pretty big, significant tariff increase. But I would remind you, the E.U. is going to China at the end of this month. I'm sure the U.S. would like to have a deal in hand before then. So, there are reasons to do these deals. We're going to watch it play out over the next two weeks. And Trump just has to be careful. He burned his hand on the stove in April by trying to do $700 billion of tariffs.  We're starting to get closer to that range again. He does have some cushion and the market's giving him a leash because Treasury Secretary Besent's done well. But if they go too far, you'll start to see backlash in that.

I do think that there's a couple of factors going on. Once the once big, beautiful bill passed, the debt ceiling was raised. And when the debt ceiling is raised, you begin to lose a lot of liquidity that we've had in the first half of this year. And so Treasury has to figure out how it's going to finance the deficit overall.  And they're making a series of moves. So, number one, they've delayed how long it will take to refill the Treasury general account. Number two, they're going to change the supplemental leverage ratio rules. Number three is that they are going to do more buybacks and increase the amount of T-bill issuance and how crypto falls into that or how stablecoin falls into that.  Once you pass the stablecoin legislation, it creates this extra T-bill demand, and it could be as much as $800 billion. So Congress is passing a stablecoin bill this week. That should set the stage to kind of fill that liquidity. And if you're in a country and you're trying to get money out, then the Bitcoin is a way to get around it.

So if you tend to see more deals, the IPO window picking back up, that should be very good for these banks. It's just a matter of how much is reflected in the stock prices in the short term. And they've had big rallies. Goldman, since its last earnings report, the day before its last earnings report to now, has had one of its strongest  in between earnings report periods since its IPO.

It's unclear if he's including himself  in that, but certainly you can see some frustration creeping in there. So two things that stand out from what he was saying. The first one is that he's talking about penalizing Russia economically. It's unclear what he means by secondary tariffs. Does he mean direct tariffs on Russia?  The US and Russia don't do a lot of direct trade, so tariffs may not have a massive impact. Does he mean secondary sanctions on countries that are taking Russian products, particularly again, China and India, who import a lot of Russian energy? So is he threatening to put penalties on countries that are doing business with Russia, particularly around the energy space? He says he'll give Russia 50 days for a deal. It's unclear exactly what he means by a deal.  or he may impose some penalties. So there's a lot that's unclear from that, but certainly a sense that he's now dangling the idea of economic penalties on the government, the regime in Russia. And secondly, he's confirming that he will indeed provide Ukraine with what seems to be defensive weapons, primarily Patriot battery systems to allow Kiev to better defend  itself and those would be paid for though, they're not going to be given to Ukraine. Europe will be paying the US to provide those weapons and it will send them on into Ukraine.

But as you say, the key thing was he didn't really clarify if this would be just defensive weapons, again, that allow Ukraine to withstand Russian missiles and drone attacks, or whether it would be offensive weapons which would allow Ukraine to keep taking some of the fight into Russian territory directly. We know Ukraine's been firing drones at Russia and looking to attack Russia on its own territory, and it's running out of those kinds of weapons, long-range missiles and so on.

But equally, for now, he's been able to keep going. The question is for how long, given those cracks that we're starting to see in his economy. So further sanctions or tariffs, or whatever you want to call it, on Russian exports to the US, that's unlikely to have a major impact because there's not much that Russia is sending directly to the US.  The real impact would be to come at countries, again, China and India primarily, who are buying a lot of energy from Russia, and that's giving Russia access to hard currency to fund their war in Ukraine. And if you penalize China,  and India for buying oil, for example, from Russia, that could have an impact.

And I think Mark will tell you that it was really perhaps more important the date of November 5th. That was the election day. Maybe that was the most important because we've made tremendous progress together. And one of the reasons that you're here today is to hear that we are very unhappy, I am, with Russia.  But we'll discuss that maybe a different day. But we're very, very unhappy with them, and we're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. Tariffs at about 100 percent. They call them secondary tariffs. You know what that means. But today, we're going to talk about something else. And, as you know, we've spent $350 billion, approximately, on this war with Russia and Ukraine.  And we'd like to see it end. It wasn't my war. It was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it. And we want to see it end. And I'm disappointed in President Putin because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there. So, based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. It's very simple. And they'll be at 100 percent. And that's the way it is. It can be more simple. It's just the way it is. I hope we don't have to do it.  But regardless, we are going to be \u2014 we make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's missiles \u2014 you saw that recently in Iran, the way those planes flew in. They had every single \u2014 14 bombs hit every target. Then you had the helicopters shoot a total of 30 bombs, 30 missiles. And they hit every single \u2014 Marco, is that right? \u2014 every single piece, every single target. And it was \u2014  I guess on a scale of zero to 10, they say it was about a 15. That's how successful it was. That's how lethal it was, a word they like to use nowadays. But it was an amazing, well-organized attack that people in this country wanted to do for 24 years. You know, when we had the pilots in last week, they were saying, sir, we've been practicing this for 24 years, meaning people, not them, but other people that are a little older now.  But they do. And you were the one that let us do it. But we've been practicing it three to four times a year for 22, 24 years, because they always knew they had to stop Iran from doing what they were doing, which is trying to come up with a nuclear weapon, a nuclear bomb. And we did it very successfully. And we make the best equipment, the best missiles, the best of everything.  The European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And they have \u2014 these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too. But we're in for a lot of money, and we just \u2014 we don't want to do anymore. And we can't.  But we make the best, and we're going to be sending the best to NATO, and in some cases to maybe, at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany, where they're going to send early-on missiles. And they'll be replaced, and NATO is going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here, who's a great ambassador. And Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So, in a nutshell, we're going to make top-of-the-line weapons, and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something, and it'll be mostly in the form of a replacement. And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy, for having had the career that he's had, because he had an amazing career  before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months.

This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want to bring what it needs to have to maintain  to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent, but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defense industrial production.  So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have the Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more. So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need.  So if you can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hexhead at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days at this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for them. So I really want to thank you for that. And it means the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries. We will deal with that. And exactly as you said, it might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here.

That's a really great job. We've been very successful in settling wars. You have India, Pakistan.  You have Rwanda and the Congo. That was going on for 30 years. India, by the way, and Pakistan would have been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was going very badly. And we did that through trade. I said, we're not going to talk to you about trade unless you get this thing settled. And they did. And they were both great. Great leaders. And they were great. But Rwanda and the Congo, that was going on for 30 years. And at least 7 million people killed and killed with  A lot of pretty rough weapons, like machetes. Heads chopped off. Going on for many years. You couldn't even get near the countries. Nobody wanted to get near. It's so frightening. And we got that one solved. Serbia, Kosovo. Got that solved. That was going to be one that was going to happen. And again, that was something I used. I used strafe for a lot of things, but it's great for settling wars.  And that was really very important. We're working. Marco is working very hard with everybody here on the Strip, the Gaza Strip. I call it the Gaza Strip. One of the worst real estate deals ever made. They gave up the oceanfront property, one of the worst deals ever made. But it was supposed to bring peace, and it didn't bring peace. It brought the opposite. But we're doing pretty well on Gaza. Steve Witkoff is here, and I think we could have something fairly soon to talk about.  And we solved another one, one that we just seem to have, Armenia and Azerbaijan. It looks like that's going to come to a conclusion, successful conclusion. We worked on Egypt with an extra neighbor who is a good neighbor. They're friends of mine, but they happened to build a dam, which  closed up water going into a thing called the Nile. I think if I'm Egypt, I want to have water in the Nile. And we're working on that one problem, but it's going to get solved. They built one of the biggest dams in the world, a little bit outside of Egypt. You know about that. You've been hearing about that one. And that turned out to be a big problem. I don't know. I think the United States funded the dam. I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam.  But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income in life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia. I'm not happy. And I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started.  If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye. But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they didn't have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. And I was outside looking in. And I said, you know, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started.  It's a real mess. We're losing \u2014 I guess they're losing 5,000 or 6,000 people a day. It's actually now more. I used to \u2014 I was saying 5,000 a day. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up, too. It's a horrible war. And it should be stopped. And so, if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing \u2014 secondary tariffs. And they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do, but I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk, and then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people. It's got to stop. It's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars' worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States, going to NATO, et cetera.  And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance. And they still would have had no chance if the equipment \u2014 they had the best equipment. Because we do make the best planes and missiles, and we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. And we have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about \u2014  the Golden Dome, it's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage, because somebody has to use that equipment. And they fought with tremendous courage, and they continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they don't have \u2014 they're losing on equipment.

Because we've seen companies like Kelinova split, we see Unilever spinning off their ice cream business, and those new entities are now being bought up by others. So you've got Mars, Aquarium, and Kelinova. You have  Ferrero acquiring WK Kellogg. But those, in order to get regulatory approval, you have to have categories that aren't overlapping. And so you're seeing a new birth of new kind of conglomerates of dissimilar portfolios. And so it makes me wonder if we're setting up another cycle where in another five years, ten years, we're going to see these companies that have been buying up the underperforming brands going through a similar type of activity."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": null, "SPEAKER_01": "Focuses on the strategic aspects of the Kraft Heinz breakup.

So we will find a way through this, but also I have to say,  For the American consumers, vehicles are going to be more expensive under the tariff regime. There's no other way around it. Yes, you can say, oh, you just need to localize. Well, yes, but that still increases the costs, because there's a reason why the supply chain is so global, because certain things are either not available here in the US or are just very expensive, so you import them. And if you change that, you still have higher costs here in the United States, which means  Manufacturers like us or actually any manufacturer has to increase prices.

I mean, they are missiles, but they are intended to intercept incoming missiles. They're most effective against incoming missiles than any other kind of projectiles, but the reality is they can take out other projectiles as well. One thing that really stood out to me in the president's announcement right there was when he suggested  that one country alone may send as many as 17 batteries. That's not 17 individual interceptor missiles. That's batteries. A battery is made up of a radar, a control station, multiple launching stations. Each one of those can fire off multiple interceptors. So a battery in and of itself  A new one right now is upwards of about a billion dollars, Hallie. The interceptors themselves, they range in price depending, but they can be well over a million dollars as well. I mean, frankly, even as much as six million, depending on the variant. But no matter what, this is an expensive system.  Only a handful of countries in the entire world operate a battery. And I think there's only two or three. I was trying to do the research as the president was talking there, that have as many as 17. The United States is one. Japan has only a few more than that. So one country sending 17 batteries is an enormous  investment by that country. Now, one thing that the president suggested there also is that the United States would work with NATO to distribute these. Remember, the United States several years ago set up a military command. It's known as SAGU. That's Security Assistance Group Ukraine.  It's a command based in Wiesbaden, Germany that is the whole purpose of the command is to distribute security assistance to Ukraine. Hallie, I could see that NATO in some way will be more even closely coordinated with SAGU as a way to effectively and efficiently distribute things like these Patriots and any other potential  defensive weapons that the United States decides to sell to these NATO countries, or what also sounds less about, it also sounds more like this is a swapping. The United States would sell newer systems to the countries and they would provide their older systems to Ukraine.

The golden age of America has arrived. Thank you. Madam Speaker, this past weekend marked one year since the attempt on President Trump's life in Butler County, Pennsylvania. While we thank God that President Trump's life was not taken, we mourn the loss of an innocent father, a firefighter, and a proud Pennsylvanian  Cory Comparator, political violence of any kind has absolutely no place in our society. Yet the violent rhetoric coming from my colleagues across the aisle has not stopped. Now, a year after the assassination attempt on President Trump's life, they have turned their violent action toward our colleagues, ICE agents, who work every day to protect our communities.  The political violence that we are seeing in our society today will not stop unless the violent rhetoric stops. One life lost to political violence is one too many. And I ask my colleagues to remember that regardless of our political beliefs, violence is never the answer to our nation's problems.

And it is definitely a warm day, but a beautiful day to be outside and enjoy all that our schools have to offer. I was just looking something up, looking at these chakras on the back.  We're going to invite you up when I finish so you can talk about those chakras. A lot of people don't realize those different areas of where we receive our thoughts, our energy.  in a real way. We're excited about this announcement today because for our children to enjoy the summer experience and families to have a great place to raise children and families, we have to use every available space that's possible as we develop their full personhood. I say over and over again, it's more than having our children be academically smart.  But they must be emotionally intelligent and grounded and well-rooted. And some of the people who stand behind me today, some of our community residents on both sides, on the left and right side of me, they play an active role in developing our neighborhoods, our partnerships, and the environment we need. And great schools, great people, and the whole city creates great community.  and a place for great children to have a pathway to success. Today, we're going to make it even better by making it easier for kids to play close to home in their own communities as part of our best budget ever. As the Deputy Mayor stated, we have opened 11 new sites in schoolyards to playgrounds program, increasing the total number  that we have opened to 313 locations. And schools are an incredible playground space. And it's a place where families and children are familiar with and know how to get to, because they get there every day during the school days. And it's a familiar environment, especially in neighborhoods without a lot of public green spaces. And when you do an analysis and look over  Many of our communities and neighborhoods did not have access to clean, open spaces, open playgrounds, open park areas, and we wanted to change that, and we're doing that every day. We want to make sure New Yorkers know that they're in the greatest city to raise a family. That means making sure our children can get outside and enjoy free play in summer days. We don't want our children sitting back playing video games every day, playing,  together is part of this socialization that children need as they continue to grow into active adults. These parks can't only be in Fort Greene Park. They cannot only be in Central Park. They must be spread throughout our entire city. So with this announcement,  We are delivering on another one of our State of the City announcements. We are putting 20,000 more New Yorkers within 10-minute walk of a green space. In the world of screens and devices, we need our parks, we need our children outdoors, interacting with other young people, and in a safe environment, and this is our way of doing so. We have to keep our city a place where everyone can raise a family.  Generation after generation, and this announcement is another way we're supporting families across the five boroughs. I just really want to thank our Park Commissioner and her team and the level of creativity. And I'm not quite clear on why, Marty, you are on the sideline. Come over here. You are Mr. Parks, man. Come and join us, you know. Talk about a great, a great New Yorker, you know. How many years?  41, 41 years and counting in Brooklyn, you know, broke us all in, from Marty Markowitz to Eric Adams. You're around through... Seven mayors. But the best one right here.  You know, just a great New Yorker. You know, we have to do something to honor some of our long-term, 40-plus-year city employees. You know, no matter who's in office, you continue to do the job. I've never met a city employee that loved their job as much as you do. You know, thank you for what you do. Now I know why you're around for so long.  So before I turn it over to our amazing commissioner, just want to also let New Yorkers know.  We're in a flood watch. It's in effect citywide until midnight tonight. We're experiencing periods of heavy rain this afternoon and evening that could lead to dangerous flash flooding. So our emergency teams have activated the city's flash flood emergency plan and are fully mobilized across agencies to protect New Yorkers. So if you live in a basement apartment,  Take it seriously. These spaces can fill with water in minutes. If you are in a flood-prone area, especially below ground, make a plan now. Know where you will go. Be ready to move quickly.

I am a mother of two, an educator, an owner of a daycare center here in Brooklyn, and a board member of the Be Proud organization. Honestly, when I heard about Schoolyards to Playgrounds initiative, I smiled, because this is exactly what our communities need. As a parent and someone who works with children every day, I see firsthand how much it means for kids to have a safe space to play, run, and just to be free.  And when I say free, I mean the kind of joyful, unstructured play that kids need, the kind that lets them imagine, climb, laugh, fall, and get back up again. That kind of play builds more than motor skills. It builds confidence within them. This program is giving families, especially in neighborhoods that have been overlooked, more than just a place to play. It gives them a peace of mind.  I can't tell you how many parents I talk to who worry about where their child can safely go after school or on a Sunday afternoon. For many, especially single parents or those working long hours, this is not a small thing, it's everything. It's helping our kids stay active and healthy, something that's more important now than ever, especially after the isolation and screen time that came with the pandemic years. Children need to be outside.  They need sunlight, fresh air, space to move, and more importantly, they need real connection. It's bringing neighborhoods together. When schoolyards open up to the public, they don't just serve the students, they become community hubs. They become places where moms meet other moms, where kids of all ages play together, and where you hear laughter echoing down the block.  And it's reminding that every child, no matter their zip code, deserves access to green space, joy, and community. Playgrounds shouldn't be a luxury. They should be a basic part of growing up. For busy working parents like me, having more after school and weekend playgrounds option is a lifesaver. And for kids who live in apartment buildings or don't have a backyard, these playgrounds may be the only outdoor space that they get.  Our children need more time outdoors to move, explore, and just be kids, away from screens and closer to nature, even in the heart of the city. This isn't a policy, this is personal. And I'm so grateful to see this kind of change happening to our city. It shows that our leaders are listening and that they care about families like mine and yours.

He would create these panels in consulting groups and have them put proposals that he always wanted them to put out. This is a typical Andrew show.  I know this guy better than anyone.

Then he comes and act like, oh, that's a good idea, and I endorse it. Andrew is a double-digit loser in the primary.  He lost by 13 points. He had his opportunity. He spent $25 million to get his message out. New Yorkers heard it. He did not sell it. He didn't get out and campaign. I said it over and over again. You guys all heard me say he was coming out only on weekends. He was not speaking to voters. And now he's saying that we should trust him. Let me tell you what else he did.  While he was running for Trump, while he was contemplating running for office, he would go around to black and brown leaders and say, I will never run against Eric Adams. I'm only running if Eric is not going to be in the race. I'm not going to run against them. Did he keep his word? No, he did not.  You can't trust a guy. The guy will say and do anything to get elected. New York City is not a consolation prize merely because he made the determination to step down as governor. And then immediately after the primary, he surrendered again.  The resiliency and the grit of a New Yorker to run this complex city, you can't give up during difficult times.

I was committed to serve out my time as mayor and deliver for the city. Hard times makes strong people.  And I have known hard times.

Our children's voices will be heard on playground. People are going to have 10 minutes walks to parks. We had 83% rate for that now. This city is moving in the right direction. And Andrew should, for once in his life, do what's best for this city and not what's best for him.  No, and that's a great question. He's saying that utilize polling to determine who should run against the Democratic primary winner. Remember, polls showed him up 40 points.  40 points. The day before the primary, his spokesperson put out the results of a poll that said he was up 10 points. He lost by 13 points. So, if we're going to use these methods of making this determination that they have already proven inaccurate, why are we going to put the risk of New Yorkers by someone who has not kept his word,  as he has a consistent record of not keeping his word. Why are we going to trust him now? He's also stated after the election that let's wait and see what the rank-choice numbers are going to be. That's what he said. The rank-choice numbers came out. Now he has another idea. So he will keep moving the goalposts as much as possible. This is just who he is. He can't help himself.  Don't get angry at him. He just can't help himself. Trust me. I served with him in Albany. I watched what he did when he stepped down. He just can't help himself. And you can't trust him at his word.  We'll do two more. Where have you been?

Go do research on what he has done.  and all of the task force and panels that he has created over time. This is a typical Andrew Cuomo playbook. You send someone out, make the announcement independently, and then you come later and seem like you're the fairest person. If you're the fairest person, think about what he did. He knew that I already made it clear I was not going to be in the Democratic primary. I was going to be on the independent line.  He knew that Madani was going to be on the Rokin's family line. So why did he all of a sudden say, now I'm going to join the independent petition? He knew the scenario. His desire was to, I'm going to force Eric out of the race.  I'm the city mayor. And you will say to yourself, well, why would he do that? Look at his record. He did the same thing to Karl McCaul. When Karl McCaul wanted to be the first black governor, he got into the race on the liberal line, and Karl McCaul lost. He did the same thing to Charlie King. Charlie King raised $5 million to become the first African-American AG. He got in the race and forced Charlie King out.  He did the same thing to Governor Patterson. He wrote behind the scene and sabotaged Governor Patterson re-election campaign, and Governor Patterson left. He did the same thing to Keith Wright when he wanted to be the first African-American to be the speaker. He sabotaged his race.

This has been a person in government who always thought it was about him and not about the people he was serving.  He cannot do what he has done in the past. He's come up against a resilient, committed mayor that loves this city. Let me get my message out. My message has not been properly reported, how I turned around this city, and I'm going to have an opportunity.  to do what he did for $25 million. I'm going to have an opportunity to campaign. I'm going to speak to New Yorkers and people going to see what I did about maternal morbidity and black and brown parents, what I did about public safety.

In spite of what I had to go through, because all New Yorkers are going through something.  You know, everyone is going through something. And I'm going to show when people talk about affordability. I put $30 billion back into the pockets of New Yorkers. Paying off medical debt, paying for the college tuition for foster care, children, lowering the cost of child care, reducing no taxes for low-income New Yorkers, no income taxes for low-income New Yorkers. I'm not talking about affordability. I'm using my role as mayor to deliver for working-class people. And people don't even know that.  I got to now communicate that. They heard Cuomo's message. They heard it. He spent $25 million. He did weekend campaigning. He lost by double digits, 13 points. He lost by 13 points. The same polls that said he was up by 10 points. And we're now going to trust that same system to allow him to run? Nah, that doesn't make any sense. Come on. New Yorkers are not that dumb. I keep telling people New Yorkers have five fingers.

The tariffs are going to cause inflation. Tariffs are going to cause a recession. Tariffs are going to cause a spike in prices. Well, what do we find out this week? This kills the media to report it, by the way.  Japanese automakers announce what? They're going to raise prices? No. Japanese automakers announced this week that they are slashing auto prices for imports coming into the United States. Now, why are they doing that? Why are they doing that? They're doing that because the tariffs force them to be competitive.  They can't pass on the cost to the consumers, because we're not going to pay that, right? So they have to cut prices. That's just one of many examples. And then today, late today, this was so great on a Friday, because sometimes Fridays, news cycles aren't so great. But today was great. So Scott Besson announces, with that kind of wry smile he has, which I love, Scott Besson announces,  Well, it turns out that in June of this year, we have a $27 billion surplus in the United States. Surplus.  Huh, I wonder why that happened. That happened because of the tariffs and the money that the tariffs brought into the United States. Now, let's go back a year, when Sleepy Joe was getting ready for that debate and he was all shot up with a B12 or whatever the heck they were giving him, peppy pills that didn't kick in. So remember that, last June, what was happening?  a $74 billion budget deficit for the month of June. So in one year, with this president and this economic team, we've had a $100 billion swing to the green. That is awesome news.  And then, and it keeps getting, this is like that one of the infomercials, it keeps getting better, there's more. Okay, there's more, the Ginsu knife comes in really quickly. All right, on job creation. Again, America first works. Anytime someone tells you it doesn't, it does.  So for job creation, last year, jobs created in the Biden administration, only 52% went to native-born Americans. Okay? 52%. Ridiculous, right? So much of it was going to illegal immigrants or foreign workers. From January to the end of June, 100% of the new jobs went to native-born Americans.  Awesome. Love it. It's so great. All right.

This is a Maha Medicaid. We'll take it. But Medicaid was created, and it's a very precious entity. Medicare and Medicaid are the backbone of the social safety net of our country. We must preserve these entities.  Medicare, of course, wasn't touched in the one big beautiful law, but Medicaid was addressed because there's fraud, waste, and abuse, as Dr. Barrasso addressed. He's a physician, by the way, and an excellent doctor. So he understands both sides, the legal side as well as the medical side. If you're able-bodied and able to work and you're not, on average you're spending 6.1 hours a day watching television or just hanging out, video games, other things.  So, we're saying you ought to try to go to work. It's better for you and it's better for the country. We've got twice as many jobs as people available to do those jobs. So we don't even call it work requirement, it's community engagement. And what the law says is you've got to try to get a job, ideally try to get 20 hours of work in if you can, or volunteer, or go get an education. And we're actually already doing pilots in two different states to get the technology ready. But if you're not willing to take that deal,  then yes, you'll lose Medicaid. But I actually think, and I have confidence in the American people, they will do this. And we have a real-life example. Eighteen months ago, the Biden administration, under duress, realized the crisis that was taking place at Medicaid and began to unwind the COVID-era changes. Those are what we were primarily addressing with this law. Fifteen million people came off Medicaid. However, less than 10 percent became uninsured.

In what country do you spend $200 billion more and your opposition accuses you of cutting? At least get the words right. We're investing more in Medicaid.  The rural hospitals get less than 5% of the extra money that comes from state-derived payments. So most of the money that's given from the federal government to the states actually goes to the big city hospitals that are well-connected, have lobbyists. So it was a dishonest narrative. However, there is a need to transform American medicine. I took this job for that reason.  I think we can do so much to make health care efficient that that will ultimately make the system viable. So the $50 billion, we call it the Rural Transformation Fund. It will help hospitals in rural areas thrive. It will get more people to work in those hospitals. We have a worker shortage. And this is the most important thing, Stuart. Sitting here in the studio, there's technology everywhere.  In an operating room, my day job before this all started, that's what I had as well. But patients don't deal with technology and the healthcare system. We need a modernization movement driven by technology, and that is coming to fruition. And this $50 billion fund will not just pay expenses.  It'll actually transform this business, and we have a meeting, a summit on the 30th of July at the White House with the president to discuss this very issue. If we make healthcare function the way banks function, the way you can order food, the way you can watch streaming videos, transform it to be a 21st century industry, it'll become productive again.

So in the cutthroat world of AI, this was a knife twist. OpenAI lined up a $3 billion acquisition only to watch Google walk off with the talent. Now, Windsurf, as Carl mentioned, it's a buzzy AI coding startup. It was deep in acquisition talks with OpenAI. The idea was to fold its tech and user base into OpenAI's expanding app layer.  But then, late Friday night, Google swoops in, not with an acquisition, but another one of these pseudo-Aqua hires, a $2.4 billion talent play for Windsurf's CEO and key engineers, leading to a key question here, guys. Why did OpenAI lose this deal? I'm told by a source that Microsoft loomed large. It is, of course, OpenAI's biggest investor, but Windsurf reportedly had concerns about sharing its technology with Microsoft  as part of the deal with OpenAI, especially since Microsoft's own copilot, it directly competes in AI coding. Now, of course, Google didn't have that baggage. So now those engineers will report to Sundar Pichai and DeepMind, not Sam Altman. Now, this all suggests that OpenAI's entanglement with Microsoft  It's becoming more of a liability, not just as open AI pushes to restructure into a for-profit and raise fresh capital, but also in M&A during these cutthroat talent wars. Now, this all matters for investors because the rules of engagement in AI, they are changing. With a regulatory climate that is still unfriendly to full acquisitions by the megacaps, the path to scale isn't M&A, it's talent poaching and license deals. And that means that companies building the models  and that have the infrastructure to train them, they are structurally advantaged. That is harder to disrupt, despite Trump's administration's push to help so-called little tech, the startups, like the ones on the bottom of your screen here, who have all sort of sold out to big tech. So the power is shifting back to\u2014or you could say it is staying with the biggest players, the mega-caps. Now, this helps explain also, guys, why Meta and Zuckerberg are spending billions of dollars to build their own models and deploy sovereign scale  infrastructure, it all comes together with stories like these ones.

She would have recently celebrated her second birthday, but this was snatched away by the very people who should have protected and cared for her.  This was an incredibly challenging investigation for the hundreds of officers who were involved in the search. Our main focus throughout the search was finding Victoria alive and we all remained devastated by her death. As anyone who's followed this trial will know, it was an incredibly complex investigation. Mark Gordon and Constance Martin deliberately avoided the authorities and continued to shield Victoria from us even after their arrest.  This meant even the most experienced child pathologists in the country were unable to establish the cause of Victoria's death. We know today's verdict won't bring Victoria back, but I'm pleased our painstaking investigation has resulted in those who caused her death being brought to justice. Victoria's death was completely avoidable. The couple had plenty of opportunities to do the right thing and come forward to ask for help.  They knew throughout that officers were looking for them and baby Victoria. They also ignored medical professionals who directly reached out to them to say that their actions were putting baby Victoria at risk. In court, Martin said they moved around a lot to avoid one single authority having jurisdiction over their daughter.  Martin stated that her children had been stolen by the state, referring to the social care system after her previous four children were removed from her by the family court. I would like to personally thank the media for the positive support you showed throughout this search. The many members of the public who reported sightings and Sussex Police for the support provided in the arrests and subsequent search for Victoria. This support was incredibly important to the investigation throughout.  Speaking personally as a father, I find it hard to comprehend how instead of providing the warmth and care that their child needed, Mark Gordon and Constance Martin chose to live outside during freezing conditions to avoid the authorities causing the death of baby Victoria. Throughout the trial, both defendants made repeated attempts to disrupt and frustrate the judicial process.  employing tactics designed to undermine proceedings and shift the focus away from the serious charges that they faced. Their behaviour ranged from non-cooperation and persistent interruptions aimed at delaying this progress. Despite these challenges, the professionalism, the resilience of their legal advocates, the judge and the court staff ensured that the integrity of the trial was maintained throughout.  Through careful case management, clear judicial direction and a steadfast commitment to due process, the court was able to navigate these obstructions effectively. As a result, the jury remained focused on the evidence and found them rightfully guilty.

The European nations know that. And we've made a deal today, and I'm going to have Mark speak about it, but we've made a deal today where we are going to be sending them weapons and they're going to be paying for them. We, the United States, will not be having any payment made.  We're not buying it, but we will manufacture it, and they're going to be paying for it. Our last meeting of a month ago was very successful in that they agreed to 5 percent, which is more than a trillion dollars a year. So they have a lot of money. And these are wealthy nations. They have a lot of money. And they want to do it. They feel very strongly about it. And we feel strongly about it, too.  We're in for a lot of money and we just, we don't want to do anymore. And we can't, but we make the best and we're going to be sending the best to NATO and in some cases to maybe at Mark's suggestion, if we go to Germany where they're going to send early on missiles.  And they'll be replaced, and NATO's going to take care of it. It's going to be coordinated by NATO, and they're going to work very much with Matt Whitaker, who's right here. He's a great ambassador, and Matt's going to be coordinating. You better do a good job, Matt. I will. But Matt's going to coordinate. He's a very talented guy. He's going to coordinate everything.  So in a nutshell, we're going to make top of the line weapons and they'll be sent to NATO. NATO may choose to have certain of them sent to other countries where we can get a little additional speed, where the country will release something and be mostly in the form of a replacement.  And I'd like to have Mark, and again, just a highly respected, pretty young guy, pretty young guy for having had the career that he's had. He had an amazing career before going to NATO. So we spent a lot of time together over the last couple of months. And if you could say a few words. Absolutely. No, no, Mr. President, dear Donald, this is really big.  This is really big. You called me on Thursday that you have taken a decision. And the decision is that you want Ukraine what it needs to have to maintain, to be able to defend itself against Russia, but you don't want the Europeans to pay for it, which is totally logical. And this is building on the tremendous success of the NATO summit, the 5 percent.  but also the decision to keep Ukraine strong and the decision to increase our defence industrial production. So based on that, this is \u2013 that was Europe stepping up. This is, again, Europeans stepping up. So I've been in contact with many countries. I can tell you at this moment Germany massively, but also Finland and Denmark and Sweden and Norway. We have the Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada. They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more.  So what we will do is work through the NATO systems to make sure that we know what Ukrainians need so that we can make packages. Of course, in a way, we discussed it this morning with Pete Hexhead at the Pentagon, in a way that, of course, the U.S. will put on its stockpiles necessary to defend this country. That's absolutely clear. But it will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on, really,  massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, et cetera, et cetera. So if I was Vladimir Putin today and hear you speaking about what you are planning to do in 50 days and this announcement, I would reconsider whether I should not take negotiations about Ukraine more seriously than I was doing at the moment if I was Vladimir Putin. But when I'm Ukraine, I think this is really great news for that. So I really want to thank you for that. That means the Europeans paying for it.  And again, I mentioned all these countries, we will deal with that. And exactly as you said, that might also mean that countries will move equipment fast into Ukraine and then the U.S. later backfilling it because speed is of the essence here. So really, thank you.

I don't know why they didn't solve the problem before they built the dam. But it's nice when the Nile River has water. You know, it's a very important source of income and life. It's the life of Egypt. And to take that away is pretty incredible. But we think we're going to have that solved very quickly. So we do good. The only one we haven't been able to get to yet is Russia.  I'm not happy, and I will tell you that Ukraine wants to do something. Again, it's a war that should have never started. If I were president, it never would have happened. I used to speak to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye.  But once I saw what was going on, I said, you know, they're going to they're going to have a war here. I was outside. The election was rigged. And I was outside looking in. And I said, yeah, that thing's going to be a war. Couldn't believe it. Because what Biden said was the exact opposite of what should have been said. And it started.  It's a real mess. We're losing, I guess they're losing 5 or 6,000 people. There's actually now more. I used to, I was saying 5,000 a day. It's actually more now. Mostly soldiers, but a lot of people in cities and towns that are getting blown up too. It's a horrible war and it should be stopped. And so if it's not done, if we don't have an agreement in 50 days, that's what we're doing. Secondary tariffs and they're biting.  And I hope we don't get to the point where we do. But I've been hearing so much talk. It's all talk. It's all talk. And then missiles go into Kiev and kill 60 people.  It's got to stop. It's got to stop. But the purpose of this is to say that this is a very big deal we've made. This is billions of dollars' worth of military equipment is going to be purchased from the United States, going to NATO, et cetera. And that's going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield. Ukraine will take it up. And, you know, say what you want about Ukraine. When the war started, they had no chance.  They still would have had no chance if the equipment, they had the best equipment, because we do make the best planes and missiles. And we make the best military equipment in the world, by far. We have new things coming out that are beyond belief. And I'm very excited about the Golden Dome. It's going to give us very strong protection. We've already started that. But they had courage because somebody has to use that equipment.  And they fought with tremendous courage and they continue to fight with tremendous courage. But they don't have, they're losing on equipment. And Russia has really taken a very positive, very, very  strong, I mean, what they've done in the last couple of weeks. Without military reasons, that's what they are doing. 700 drones a day, missiles, bombing cities. This is not because of military goals. It is just creating panic, keeping people out of their sleeps, hitting towns. It's really terrible. And it is meaning a lot of people lose their lives, but also the infrastructure, whole cities being  They're wiping out the electric. It's going to take years to rebuild it. That's going to be the next problem. But that's going to take a long time. Many of the cities are knocked down to the ground. Many of the people have left. But many have stayed. I don't know. They actually stay. Most have stayed, actually. It's incredible that they stay, knowing that a missile could be hitting your apartment house.  And your apartment house that you're sitting in could collapse on top of you. And they do very heavy construction. They don't use rebar. They do very thick concrete construction. Those are heavy buildings, big buildings and heavy buildings. And they collapse like  like they're made out of paper. It's unbelievable to see this happening with people, so many people being killed. So we think we're going to make progress and we hope we're going to make progress. In the meantime, we're going to get you good service on what you need. And we really became friendly with NATO this last meeting. You know, we went from 2% to 5%, which everyone said  was not even a possibility. They weren't paying 2%. Many of them were paying much less than 2%. But even those, since you became president, all committed to the 2% before the summit. And now, collectively, we committed to the 5%. That's right. They did. They've been very good. And I think I made a lot of friends over there. We had a couple of days of very intensive talks.  And they're great people. They're leaders of countries, leaders of countries. Many of them great countries, some of them smaller countries. But for the most part, that's a very solid, strong countries and very successful. Some of them are among the most successful countries in the world.  So that's the story. We hope that's going to have an impact on Vladimir Putin. And we hope it's going to have an impact on Ukraine also. We want to make sure that Ukraine does what they have to do. All of a sudden they have, they may feel emboldened or maybe they don't want, you know, this is a very  difficult situation. Ukraine wants a peace deal. I think so. And they will stay committed to that. There's no doubt they want it. But the Russians have to be. They have to continue to want it, though.

So definitely inching closer to that target. Argus said that over the past year, the shares have outperformed and they note that majority of the outperformance has occurred post the passage of the Genius Act in June.  Argus also said that it's noteworthy because Coinbase is the first crypto-native member to be included in the S&P that happened back in May. The stock has around 20 analysts buy, 16 hold, and 14 sell. Another thing, of course, Coinbase is influenced by Bitcoin, which is now around $121,000, which is really a huge record. So now, Strategy, MSTR, and Galaxy JLXY are also edging higher because as Bitcoin rises, so do crypto-linked stocks.  There they go, hand in hand. Let's move on to Autodesk. They're stepping back from an acquisition. Is that right? That's right. And shares are edging higher, 4%. So investors are definitely liking that. Autodesk is ADSK. So they rose after reports that it's dropping its pursuit of PTC, which would have ranked it as one of the largest deals this year. So Autodesk is a software provider and it decided to shelve the potential catch and stock deal for PTC. So Autodesk is bigger. It has a market cap of around $60 billion.  PTC is a little smaller at around $23 billion. So in a regulatory filing Monday, Autodesk said it will remain focused on executing strategic priorities. It said it will allocate capital to organic investment, target it, and tuck in acquisitions. Paul will know a lot of those. It didn't mention PTC, though.  That's what investors are implying. Kview? What is that? Kview, it's the maker of Tylenol, Neutrogena and Listerine. So they said that its CEO, Thibaut Mangan, will leave the company and board of director Kirk Perry will take over as interim CEO.  They also said that they will continue an ongoing comprehensive review of strategic alternatives. So this is a consumer goods company. It really has faced a lot of pushback from activist investors. And for now, the company is really kind of heeding to that call. And you're right, they were spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023.

And what job would I be interested in?  He said, Christy, I know people have talked to you before about different cabinet positions, maybe interior ag, something like that. And I said, Mr. President, what I would most like to do for you is to be your Secretary of Homeland Security.  And he said, really? Why? And I said, sir, because it is your number one priority. It's your number one priority. And I think that you're going to have to have somebody who's actually strong enough to do it, that it's a hard job, and somebody is going to actually have to follow through on it. And I also think that you need somebody who can communicate about it.  someone who is a wife and a mom and a grandma that can talk to families and recognize how the policies and what we're doing to make our country safer is better for all Americans and will help protect our communities for our kids and our grandkids to grow up and have the same opportunities that we have each and every day. I'm just so blessed and honored that he gave me that privilege to serve in this role. Now,  The Department of Homeland Security was created after 9-11. It was created in response to the terror attacks that hit the New York City and the World Trade Towers. And it was a bunch of different agencies and the federal government all put under one umbrella, whose mission is to defend the security of the homeland, and to do so with honor and integrity. Therefore, I have 23 different components in my agency.  You know that it is my job and Customs and Border Protection's job and Border Patrol's job in order to go out and secure the border. President Trump has secured our border for the United States of America. He's given me fantastic partners in Tom Holman and Stephen Miller and Rodney Scott.  Tim Todd-Lyons, who's out there running ICE for us. We want to thank all of our light ICE officers for what they do every day on interior law enforcement as well.  Over 99% of the people that were coming through the Darien Gap over a year and a half ago, do you remember the hundreds of thousands of people that were coming through there, coming into the United States of America? Now we have reverse migration, going the opposite direction, out of the United States, back to their home countries. A 94% decrease in people coming to the border.

Now, in China, of course, as you guys were talking about, there are so many car makers that are putting out so many new models, but this one has been getting a lot of buzz. People have been saying this is a company, Xiaomi, that is a household name, and they really like the look. In fact, a lot of people are saying that the design elements remind them of a Ferrari. Now, I got a chance to test drive this car, and there are a lot of fun tech elements. There's a magnetic  tissue box Gadgets, which of course is like a vintage thing for for Xiaomi as well as the the screen It's much easier to use people have been talking about how it's almost exactly like a smartphone and then of course there are The some of the the comfort levels actually the comfort elements are quite nice as well You can lie all the way back as a driver in one of their seats  It doesn't handle though quite as well as one might hope when I was driving it.

I mean, the president came in and wanted to establish peace.  Certainly, between Ukraine and Russia, Ukraine, after stumbling in the Oval Office, agreed to a ceasefire without any conditions. Putin has put that off for months. The president exhibited an enormous amount of patience, largely because, you know, when they're talking to each other, Putin talks nice. You know, he talks about mutual economic benefit. He says, I'm as interested in peace as you are, Mr. President.  But then, Putin plays hard on the battlefield. The truth is, during that entire time, he escalated the war, particularly against civilians, as we have all seen. The last few days have demonstrated the culmination of that, the scale and size of that escalation. Five, six hundred things flying in the sky, largely against civilian targets.  So, the president is frustrated. Putin wanted him to get frustrated. And he wanted the president to pull away, Dana, and stop supporting Ukraine just out of frustration and leave it alone. But that's not happening. While he achieved his goal in frustrating the president, the president is not pulling away. He's actually going to turn the war around somewhat here, because he's going to do two things.  One, he's going to increase military assistance, let the Europeans buy our weapons systems. They have the money to do it. And they're either going to let Ukraine buy them from them or they're going to give them to Ukraine. So we're going to up gun Ukraine's capability. And believe me,  Putin pays serious attention to battlefield effects, because that is where his head is. And we're also going to authorize the Senate and eventually the House, and the Europeans are going to do the same in terms of some pretty tough sanctions.  particularly on those who are buying Russian oil. That's China, India, and Brazil. So both of these put together is kind of one-two punch here to go right at the problem here with Russia on the battlefield and also their kind of revenue source that obviously is essential for them to keep their troops on the battlefield trained and well-equipped.

So Ukraine has been conducting a remarkable successful defense.  against a force that doubles them in size on the ground. And Putin has increased the targeting of civilian, which in of itself is a war crime. And he's increased the kidnapping of children and moving them into Russia, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20,000, which is just horrific when you think of something like that. So yeah, why is he doing that and the focus on civilians? He wants to break the will of the Ukrainian people  and undermine their support for the government and for the war, that they throw their hands up and say, enough is enough. And that would force Zelensky to go make major concessions to the Russians. And that's not happening because the Ukrainian people are steadfast. They are still supporting Zelensky.

He is now coming off of a very successful Midnight Hammer operation, where he made the right call  And that has changed the game as far as negotiating with Iran and Middle East partners. He needs to change the game with Putin. And that's why he's looking at everything on the table. Again, I mentioned a lot of these things have been on the table before. It's how you implement them and how you get Putin to sit down at the table. Because as he has made very clear with President Zelensky, President Zelensky agreed at the first week of March for a full and unconditional ceasefire.

But notably, as President Trump has made clear in the last 24 hours, this is going to be paid for with European dollars. He might even announce today that he's going to be seizing money that is frozen in bank accounts that Russia has had in the West, and those monies are going to pay for weapons. So this is an America first version of what Biden did before. He's taking it into his own hands and changing it.  As far as sanctions, sanctions is a whack-a-mole operation. That's why when people bring up how many sanctions Donald Trump has done as opposed to Biden, they always mention this enormous number that Biden put on against Russia. And that's because they kept having to be updated, because once you put on sanctions on a company, they'll just start a new company and run their money through that way. So we need to keep updating them.  Notably, Europe has done the 17th and 18th tranche of sanctions just this year alone, and America is behind on that. That's why I believe that this Senate bill will be passed by the 25th of this month.

Because Ukraine had Russia on the run numerous times, and if America had provided even more weapons, we would be in a vastly different place. I think President Trump is not going to be the first person to blink in this kind of conflict. And so far, over the course of Putin's presidency, he has threatened nuclear war since the first week of his administration.  since the early 2000s. So what needs to be done is somebody needs to come in and say, we're going to press along what we want to do. If you want to go ahead and change the game with nuclear weapons, that's on you.

Constance Martin was reported missing on the 5th of January. That same evening, the car she'd been travelling in with partner Mark Gordon caught fire on the M61 near Bolton. Van driver Ken Hudson had been behind them on the motorway. He pulled over to help them and called the emergency services. The couple left on foot, heading towards Bolton.  They left behind a placenta wrapped in a towel and Martin's passport, along with a bag of more than 30 mobile phones, used nappies, a cat in a pet carrier, and a Bible. A local resident gave them a lift into Bolton, where they were seen at the Bolton Interchange bus station, before deciding to take a taxi 35 miles to Liverpool, paying \u00a380. From there, they flagged down another taxi, which took them 270 miles across the country to Harwich in Essex.  Driver Ali Yaria said the woman was shivering and he saw a baby inside the woman's jacket wearing only a nappy. In Harwich, they checked into a Premier Inn using a false name, Thomas. Hotel staff said Martin paid in cash and seemed, quote, quite distressed. After being asked to leave in the morning because they couldn't provide proof of identity, they moved to the Friart Hotel for the night. They checked out early the next morning.  Martin was seen outside Harwich Port two hours later. A member of the public confronted the couple, having seen a news report about their disappearance. Dale Gosling said that a baby was wrapped inside Martin's coat and that he heard crying. The couple then took a taxi from Harwich to Colchester. Then, later that morning, another taxi from Colchester to East Ham in East London. CCTV showed the couple getting out of the cab with their baby girl, Victoria.  Martin cradling the child under her jacket. Later that day, Gordon bought a buggy in Argos before meeting Martin in a kebab shop. She assembled the buggy and then put the baby in. They then took a series of taxis around London, abandoning the buggy and, prosecutors said, transferring the baby to a little shopping bag instead. From North London, they headed to the port town of New Haven, arriving at five in the morning.  A CCTV camera at a petrol station shows them wandering around in the early hours, before heading towards the South Downs on foot. They weren't seen again until four days later. Martin was back at the garage, buying sweets, snacks and petrol. They claimed the baby had already died by this point. The next sighting was on the outskirts of Brighton. Gordon was spotted emerging from a tent in the woods in Stanmer Park.  Two weeks later, the Met Police offered a \u00a310,000 reward for information. But it was more than a fortnight before witnesses reported further sightings. One near Hollingbury Golf Course in Brighton. Another in the Coldeen Lane area of the city. And back in Stanmer Park a day later. Witness Pauline Mason told the court she saw a mother with a baby who she believed was dead.  On the 20th of February, the pair were captured on CCTV, trying and failing to break into Hollingbury Golf Course and rummaging through the bins. A week later, they were back in the same area. This time, though, they would not go unnoticed. Their run was about to come to an end. They were spotted in a local shop buying food and withdrawing cash.

So we're actually, you know, we've just announced a couple of acquisitions in the last nine months, and we're actually going to announce a couple of more acquisitions in the next six to nine months.

For a mid-market retailer to be able to provide their product catalogs, their inventory, their pricing across multiple channels, across a pretty complex permutation of product categories is really hard, especially when you don't have billions and billions of revenue on scale to kind of fulfill that, right? So what Cart.com does is makes that easy. If you're a brand wanting to sell in every channel in the world,  We enabled that technologically and operationally. And, you know, today we're obviously North America focused, but very soon we're going to be international where if you want to add Italy or France as an international market, um, you can just come to cart.com and within 24 hours, you can start selling there."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 256.931, "text": "Oh, Mary, you mentioned acquisitions.

Look, the thing about Card.com is that we're known as a logistics company, but we're really the broadest infrastructure company and the deepest infrastructure company as a service in the world today.  We do logistics, we do order management, we do services. So when we think about acquisition targets, we're looking at categories, not just product categories, but companies that are doing software, companies that are doing services and companies that are going to help augment our operational infrastructure and scale.

You also have to think about, OK, it's not just about procuring. It's also about selling. It's about increasing demand for these brands.  You know, we sort of solve a three part problem. One, we help consumers drive to these brands. Two, we make sure that they have the technology to basically sell in the languages and geographies that were enabling the infrastructure. And then three, we have to help with the procurement, which is the last mile delivery of those packages, right? So we are actually taking over the complexity of the problem so that the brands don't have to. Essentially, we do all the hard work around the complex infrastructure from technology to logistics.

So if you think about it, right, the logistics problem actually starts with the consumer picking, yes, that they want to buy something.  And if you can have very large data sets that connect the demand problem with a supply problem, then you're essentially optimizing the entire value chain. So we have forecasting models that are using and leveraging AI today. We predict demand before it occurs, and we're continuing to invest very heavily in that technology so that we can give the brands we work with a much upper hand."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 468.616, "text": " You know, there seems to still be this disconnection between what companies know about me.

We use very large anonymized data sets to do and power the analytics that we ultimately end up providing for the brands we work with.  So once the consumer feels comfortable that the way their data is being used is only to help them not to invade their privacy, they then become more willing to actually allow you access to it. The way we're connecting for these brands, the data, from the time that the consumer starts thinking about a product to the time the product actually shows up to their doorstep,  We're the only company in the world that has that breadth of information, right?

I think too many companies are either using AI as a buzzword and not really using it, or they're using it in a way that's maybe abrasive and not actually what consumers really want.  So you have to find the sweet spot of using artificial intelligence in a way that you're optimizing for the profitability of these brands, for the growth of these brands.

But the interesting story about Card.com is that about half of the business, half of our revenue is actually with B2B companies. So, you know, first of all, you've got a virtually almost a trillion dollar addressable market in the mid-market retail segment.  And then you've got another trillion and a half dollar addressable market on the B2B side. So we actually do a lot of work with B2B companies. Charismatics Brands is one example where they're the providers of scrubs for doctors. And they work with a large number of shops across the United States where small mom and pop shops where they provide their scrubs to and we're powering their order management and logistics platform. We actually do a lot of work with the federal and state government  So we're actually doing a lot of work in health and pharma. So when you think about the infrastructure that we've built for the B2C segment, that's only about one third of our overall customer segment, but the other two thirds is actually B2B and the government.

The question then becomes is, does China want to eat that risk?  You know, China has been more or less bankrolling this for Putin over the course of the last three-plus years. China has problems of their own. As you say, they need to get a trade deal with the United States. Are they going to kind of cool on the Russian relationship? And I don't really see North Korea as an alternative to China for Russia here. They're more of a surrogate of China.

When the war came south and chaos followed, I took up the cause others dropped. I raised troops. I found supplies. I met with General Green. I helped push back the British in the Carolinas.

They went from not having a Bitcoin ETF to now they have a top 20 largest ETF in the world.  So there's a lot of inflows there. Second thing is the options expired at the end of Q2. And so all that downward pressure on Bitcoin obviously goes away. That helps, kind of like a beach ball getting put underneath the water, right? Obviously, it can pop back up. And then the third thing is that there was a lot of short sellers. And you started to see that build up. And as they got blown out as Bitcoin ran, you get into this price discovery phase. If you go back to November, we went from $70,000 to $90,000 in about two to three weeks. And $70,000 was a new all-time high.  What we're watching now is we broke through that $110,000 range.

Michael, this is quite the turnaround because  Donald Trump had generally been associated with not arming Ukraine, and now it seems as though offensive weapons may be on the cards. We've been talking in previous days about defensive weapons, anti-aircraft and anti-missile kind of batteries, but now potentially allowing Ukraine to strike back."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 37.493, "text": " Yes, I mean, if this is a turnaround, then it's quite a big turnaround, if that's what it is. And they've been very cautious in Kiev this morning, saying, you know, we're grateful for anything that President Trump says, but we can't expect him to go back to where the Americans were before Trump became president.  Nevertheless, it does appear that President Trump has reassessed his relationship with Vladimir Putin and is preparing some sort of statement which will have probably maybe three elements. One element is more sanctions and pressure on Russia, and there's a big bill ready to go in Congress of 500% sanctions worth hundreds of billions of dollars of trade, including secondary sanctions, so he might go along with that or parts of it.  Secondly is Patriot air defence batteries, which he's already said he would provide under an arrangement where they sell them to the Europeans, the Europeans give them to Ukraine. And then thirdly, and this is the most interesting bit, if this is what he says, is the supply of offensive weapons or the sale maybe of offensive weapons to Ukraine. Because that would imply that he's accepted that Ukraine will continue the war.  that Ukraine has given up on a ceasefire, as the way everybody else has, that the Russians are not going to come to a ceasefire until they're under greater pressure. And so maybe that would be the third element in what he says. But we don't know. I don't think even in the Pentagon they're entirely sure what he's going to say. And there's a lot of choreography going on here. Keith Kellogg, the American envoy, is in Kiev.  Mark Rutter, the NATO Secretary General, is in Washington.

So it was 144 versus 40, but those 40 contained more than half of the world's population. So the rest of the world has been standing back from the very beginning to see what happens. And this is a sort of a contest  between those who say, look, the Ukraine war is the front line in a more fundamental struggle between dictatorship and liberal democracy, and those, including the Trump and the MAGA Republicans, who say, this is a regional war. You know, it's just a regional war, it's nasty and it's not our problem. And what the Europeans are saying, look, it is your problem if you think you're ever going to be a liberal democracy, if you're ever going to stand with the liberal democracies. Now, would President Trump come onto that side of the island? I doubt it.  But his credibility is on the line, and America's credibility is on the line as to whether America is going to look as if it's been manipulated by the Russians and Trump has been manipulated by Putin. And you suspect, given that Trump sees power in very personal terms, is that he has got offended by Putin's apparent insouciance to say nice things to him on the phone and talk about the need to address all the diplomatic issues, and then the following night to bombard Ukraine with 500, 600, 700 drones and missiles.

And so there's, I think, a lot of patriotism in the data. The bottom line is, people prefer American products,  And so, therefore, the demand for imports has gone way down, down so much that even with what tariffs have been there, where people would say, oh, they might increase prices at least a little bit, we have seen prices going down. The other factor, don't forget, is that, if we have a trade deficit year after year after year with a country, then, by definition, they're supplying stuff to us inelastically.

Bottom line is this, the automakers have found those areas where they can add a shift.  at overtime, at plants that are already running, and that's what they're doing.

Now, as we mentioned earlier, Dragon is fully autonomous, which means it's capable of flying itself. Dragon was designed from the beginning for flying humans to space, even though its first missions carried only cargo.  Now, before we could fly humans, our teams implemented a number of design upgrades to make sure that both Dragon and Falcon 9 are suitable for flying people, and then put both vehicles through thousands of tests to prove their safety. Now, prior to the Axiom Mission 4, SpaceX successfully completed 52 flights of Dragon to and from orbit since 2010, including 47 trips to the International Space Station."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "Provides additional context about the mission, including its launch date, duration, and the number of experiments conducted.

Well, immediately my mind went to, of course, was 30% on the EU that has been threatened by Donald Trump, but also 30% on Mexico as well. And this one is close to my heart because whenever we see a Mexican tariff headline, specifically here in Europe, there's one stock that always moves off of it, and it's Diageo, because they are one of the largest sellers of tequila.  there, I think something like 10 or 11 percent comes revenue, is exposed from that Mexico to U.S. or U.S. to Mexico tariff. But, of course, the exports coming from Mexico to the United States. Nevertheless, if you were into tequila at 7 in the morning or any other time, this is the one for you. DGE is this ticker for the London listing, which is actually higher this morning by 0.7 of 1 percent. But for our American audience,  Keep your eye on the ADRs. It's also listed in the U.S. markets. DEO is your ticker, and those shares are down about four-tenths of one percent. It's likely to shake out at the open, but this kind of arbitrage, basically this difference between the two listings on both sides of the Atlantic, is also something you're seeing in another big European company that has a lot of exposure to the United States, and that is Novo Nordisk. So again, alongside your tequila, if you want some Ozempic with it as well, this is the stock to keep an eye on, because Novo Nordisk is a Danish  company, 60% of their exports go to the United States. Of course, as they kind of capitalize on this weight loss theme, those shares are higher by two-tenths of 1% in the European session. But again, if you look at those ADRs, that's where you see the pain. So, NVO, only down about one-tenth of 1%. But earlier in the session, it was down  Far far more and that's the one you want to keep an eye on so keep an eye on some of these European ADRs That have a lot of exposure to America specifically Exposure to these tariffs another space that we're gonna be looking at specifically is the auto sector And that's where you got to go to your favorites you got to go to Ford you got to go to General Motors Both under pressure this morning a lot of the has to come with their supply chains that extend into Mexico So Ford shares which are the ticker just the letter F trading just shy of $12 a share down about three-tenths of 1%  General Motors is the other. GM is your ticker there. Down a whopping 1.7%. But I'm not seeing a ton of trades in the stock just yet in the pre-market. So, just keep an eye on how this one shakes out as we get closer to the opening bells on Wall Street. Trading at about $52 and change this morning. A couple of others that you want to definitely keep your eye on as we talk about trade, as we talk about the chip sector.  Synopsys is one that's catching a lot of attention and is your biggest volume mover to the upside. SNPS is your ticker. This is one that has seen quite a bit of scrutiny when it comes to the deal flow with China. It looks like China's conditionally approving the Synopsys and Ansys deal. This is a big deal when it comes to their chip supply chain. It was a $35 billion deal.

Even if the calculation that only, quote, 40 percent is going to be paid by U.S. consumers, that's a $120 billion tax increase.  a regressive tax increase to U.S. consumers this year.

Some of it's stylistic, but I think my concerns tend to be more of the frog in the boiling pot of water variety, which is to say, over time, U.S. enterprises, small, medium and large businesses, becoming less and less  globally competitive, losing long-term business relationships.

Shoppers spending heavily online from last Tuesday to Friday, what some are calling Black Friday in summer. That was led by Amazon's Prime Day. Adobe Analytics saying that online spending grew more than $24 billion across the United States retailers. And that was above Adobe's prior forecast. And Reuters reporting that NVIDIA's Jensen Wang is going to hold a media briefing in Beijing this week.  He's going to be making his second visit to China just in about the past three months. In an interview that aired yesterday on CNN, he downplayed the United States' fears that his firm's chips will aid the Chinese military. And speaking of China, the country's export growth beating expectations last month that was boosted by shipments to non-U.S. markets and a temporary reprieve from U.S. tariffs. And J.P.

But JPMorgan now ramping up its efforts in that same area as the growth of private lending has exploded. A new piece in the Wall Street Journal this morning saying that Diamond is now racing to claim a stake before JPMorgan is left behind. The report details the bank's strategy to, quote, swoop in strategically and profit if there is a meltdown. I think that's the most important part about this, which is he's not going whole hog into this space. The idea is  to the extent you can be opportunistic. How do you do it. There's potentially a lot of leverage in the space. I mean the question always has been in the private credit market. Some people would say it's all matched up perfectly because there's not a duration mismatch meaning people raise it.  a fund that starts one year and ends 10 years later. And they loan it for 10 years. And that's the end of it. So that should be good. The question is whether there's leverage embedded in those funds. Some of the funds don't have leverage.

But it's also the reestablishing of deterrence around the globe. And that's why what happened through Operation Midnight Hammer was so important. By the way, a mission from the beginning, President Trump set the tone of what that would look like, the effects that would happen. He understood exactly, and our job was simply to execute.  and to watch the skilled and courageous men and women of our military from beginning to end, from the situation room, to the maps, to the trajectories, to hearing the radio calls, I wish everybody could hear that and see that. It makes you so proud to be an American. And it reestablishes an understanding for the world of what we're capable of. No other country on Earth could even remotely do what those pilots did.  plan, coordinate, facilitate, refuel midair, you know, dozens of times. Seven jets going one way, two deceiving the world the other way. Everybody thought it was going that way. You zig, you zag. Fly over Iran. They never see you. They don't shoot. You disable enemy capabilities, and you get out of dodge. Or as President Trump says, he said, skedaddle. You skedaddle.  That is a specific military doctrinal term. Now, that was not just a message to Iran's nuclear capabilities. It was a message to all of our adversaries and all of our allies that American leadership and strength is back.  We've also sent the message to the world, through what President Trump has done in Europe and through NATO, that the era of freeloading off America is also over. I'm a big fan of alliances, and we're a proud member of NATO. But an alliance can't just be about flags.  and conferences. It needs to be about formations and capabilities. Military alliances only work when you have actual hard power to bring to bear. And only because of President Trump is Europe stepping up and spending now what was inconceivable. Many of these countries were spending 1% on defense just in his first term. But because of President Trump's leadership, they're committed now to spending 5% of GDP on defense, which means they lead the way, and we don't have to do it for them.  So in closing, I just want to never forget that the motto of our great country, when I got criticism for starting a monthly prayer service at the Department of Defense, voluntary prayer service, I reminded our friends in the media, you know, the motto of our country is, in God we trust.  That the military has a long heritage of being on bended knee, appealing to heaven in the most impossible of situations. God's providence brought us here. Our founders understood that. So I want to commend you for being in these seats.  for having the leadership that you have in your high schools, in your colleges, in your communities, for having the courage of your convictions to stand up and lead based on your principles. That is leadership. That is putting America first. That is showing strength. And I commend you for that. But I also hope, on behalf of a new and improved Department of Defense, that you will also take a look at serving your country, that you will consider the incredible lineage  Let me tell you something. I've never met someone who served, it's very few and far between, who regrets the day that they raised their right hand to defend their nation and try to test themselves to see whether they can stand up to the legacy of previous generations. Now, it's my job and it's President Trump's job to make sure we use those troops properly, that they're properly trained, that they have a clear mission, a limited objective that everyone understands.  And they've got the best equipment in the world, which President Trump is providing. But what we really need are the best young Americans. So thank you for being here. God bless our warriors.

Bloomberg News has learned the European Union is preparing to step up its engagement with other countries hit by President Donald Trump's tariffs. Let's go to London and get the very latest with Bloomberg's James Woolcock. Good morning, James.  Good morning, Nathan and Karen. The EU is reaching out to the likes of Canada and Japan to see if there might be a unified global response to America's trade aggression. This reporting from Bloomberg comes after the US president issued a new ultimatum of a tariff rate of 30% over the weekend on the block.  Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that rate of 30% would hit exporters in Europe's largest economy to the core. Talks are still stuck on several issues, especially cars and tariff rates on agriculture, but if levies do go up in two weeks' time, the EU is prepared to retaliate on roughly $84 billion worth of US goods, risking further trade escalation. In London, James Woolcock, Bloomberg Radio.  All right, James, thank you. Well, President Trump will be heading to the U.K. for his second state visit. King Charles will host the president in September. Trump had warmly welcomed the offer of another state visit to Britain when he was handed the invitation by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February. The U.K. was the first country to sign a tariff reduction deal with the U.S. in May.  Before the president heads overseas, Karen, he may have found a new pressure point for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The president and his allies have been seizing on cost overruns at the central bank's headquarters renovation as they continue to hammer Powell for leaving interest rates unchanged.

Ukraine had been receiving weapons from the U.S., but only with money remaining from former President Joe Biden's time in office. President Trump had previously refused to consider seeking additional funds, arguing it would only harden Russian President Vladimir Putin's stance and dim chances to end the fighting.  Nathan, former President Joe Biden is pushing back at one of President Trump's harshest claims about his mental acuity while he was in office. In an interview with the New York Times, the former president said he made all the clemency decisions that were recorded with an auto pen and that he had orally granted all pardons and commutations issued at the end of his term. And he says President Trump and Republicans are, quote, liars for claiming his aides used an auto pen without his authorization.  Turning to the latest on the flood disaster in Texas, Karen, the search for victims is expected to resume today along the Guadalupe River.

Futures are lower as we begin the new trading week, but Bitcoin is on the rise again. In fact, the cryptocurrency is trading at a record right now, up 2.8% above $122,400. Bitcoin is now up about 30% since December.  Nathan, we're starting to see some of the impact of the U.S. trade war with China. China ended the first half of the year with a record trade surplus of about $586 billion after exports to the U.S. began to stabilize. Exports rose year on year by a higher than expected 5.8 percent in June. Shipments to the U.S. fell 16 percent from a year earlier after slumping by over 34 percent in May.  And staying in Asia, Karen, the slump in Japan's long-term bonds is accelerating, pushing yields sharply higher in a move that puts global debt markets on alert. While the pressure in Japan is being heightened by a looming election on July 20th, concerns over government spending beyond their means also apply to the U.K., Europe and U.S.  Time now for a look at some of the other stories making news in New York and around the world. For that, we're joined by Bloomberg's Michael Barr. Michael, good morning. Good morning, Karen. Two women were killed and two other people were wounded in a shooting at a Lexington, Kentucky church in a rampage that began after a state trooper was shot and wounded. Authorities said the suspect was also killed Sunday. In a news conference, Lexington Police Chief Lawrence Weathers says it began after the trooper pulled over a vehicle near the airport.  The trooper had pulled over a vehicle on terminal drive after receiving a license plate reader alert in the area of Versailles Road. The trooper was shot and the suspect fled. Chief Weathers says the suspect then carjacked the vehicle and fled to the church where he began shooting at people there. The suspect was later killed by Lexington police. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is set to meet President Donald Trump this week.  NATO said Ruda will be in Washington today and tomorrow and will meet with Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as members of Congress. Attorney General Pam Bondi is said to have fired multiple Justice Department employees who were involved in two federal prosecutions of President Trump during the Biden administration.  The Washington Post reports, according to several people familiar with the terminations, 20 people were fired from the department, including two prosecutors who worked under former special counsel Jack Smith. Reports of increasing tension between A.G. Bondi and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino over the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. There are new details now about a confrontation the two had last Wednesday, with Bongino reportedly storming out afterwards.  Former U.S. Attorney General Chris Christie says he believes the decision went all the way to the top. There's no chance, in my opinion, that Pam Bondi made this decision on her own. No chance. She was instructed by the White House that we're not releasing this stuff. And that's why he's defending her.  Former AG Chris Christie was on ABC's This Week, heard Sundays on Bloomberg.

Well, EU negotiators, I think, found the talks that they've been involved in really disrupted by President Trump's announcement over the weekend that he was just looking for a 30 percent tariff on their goods. Negotiations had been proceeding with the assumption, really,  the working assumption that perhaps there might be a lower tariff rate, but also particular carve-outs for some industries. So we're talking about German automakers or alcohol exports from Europe, things like that. So there really had been a lot of progress made in kind of a complex formula.  The president saying, you know, it might be 30 percent and we'll leave it at that. It's you know, this could be just another negotiating tactic. You know, it's only July 14th. August 1st is still a long ways away. But the EU signaling that they want to work more closely with some other  U.S. trade partners who are perhaps feeling the same kind of heat, including Japan and Canada. That's not clear what exactly they might do. They might share some tips on what's going on in their own negotiations.

We know that President Trump last week teased that he would make a major statement on Russia today. Trump made quickly stopping the war one of his diplomatic priorities as he has increasingly expressed frustration about Russian President Vladimir Putin's unbudging stance on U.S.-led peace efforts.  He says, quote, Putin talks nice, and then he bombs everybody. He said this late Sunday, as he confirmed, the US is sending Ukraine badly needed US-made Patriot air defense missiles to help defend off Russia's intensifying aerial attacks. Now, Russia has spread terror in Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv, with hundreds of drones and crews and ballistic missiles that Ukraine's air defenses are struggling to counter.  If we look back in recent months, we know June brought the highest monthly civilian casualties of the past three years, with 232 people killed and 1,343 wounded. The United Nations Human Rights Mission in Ukraine confirming that news late last week. Russia launched 10 times more drones and missiles in June than in the same month last year.  That has happened at the same time as Russia's bigger army is making a new effort to drive back Ukrainian defenders on part of the front line. A top ally of President Trump, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said Sunday that the conflict is nearing an inflection point, as Trump shows growing interest in helping Ukraine fight back against Russia's full-scale invasion. It's a cause that President Trump had previously dismissed as being a waste of US taxpayer money.  So, again, if you're just now, tune again, giving you a live look at the White House as we're following this breaking news this Monday morning. President Donald Trump's envoy arriving in Kiev, Ukraine, as the U.S. pledges Patriot missiles to Ukraine.

I got to tell you, though, the Democrat Party, we were wondering if they were going to moderate. You know, Brian, I sat down with Gavin Newsom back in the spring. It went very viral on his new podcast. And it seemed as if he wanted to try to move to the middle. It turns out the Democrat Party and the Democrat base does not want a move to moderation.

When you break addiction to alcoholism or drug use, you can sometimes have a very difficult withdrawal period. But the voters overwhelmingly voted in November that they want mass deportations, period. And six months in, I don't think that Trump voters or the Trump base  They necessarily want to hear something of, I won't even use the word amnesty, but some soft accommodation. There are still legal ways that you can get migrant labor, H-2B visas or H-2A visas, for example. What we're talking about here, though, is trying to break the addiction of illegals that have taken jobs in some of these areas. Now, the counterargument is they say, well, Americans don't want to do these jobs. Well, my other counter to that is, well, what if the addiction to migrant labor has actually prevented automation, prevented the use of AI or robotics?

I'm sure it is for all of you as well.  That much further, we would have lost President Trump. Of course, God intervened. Of course, God wanted him to be president. Of course, God has his hand on his shoulder. There's no other explanation for that. And it's hard to stomach. I'm sure it's hard to stomach for the Trump family.  You know, in 1981, I was a very young guy, and Ronald Reagan was elected, and I joined his administration. And one day, just sitting at my desk, doing my job, and all of a sudden, it was like World War III happened. The sirens were blaring. I never heard anything like it in my life. There were fire engines. There were automobiles. It was just deafening, as these cars just kept driving by, and that was the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan.  And he almost died. And the surgeon who operated on him passed away last week. You think about this. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. James Garfield, William McKinley, who's one of President Trump's heroes, was the president who believed in tariffs. John Kennedy, of course, all assassinated. Serious assassination attempts against Andrew Jackson, against Theodore Roosevelt, against Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Gerald Ford, and, of course, Ronald Reagan, and our dear President Trump.  So that's 12. Four succeeded, eight failed. 12 out of 45 presidents. Obviously, he's the 47th president, but 45 men have held that position.  Give or take, that means one quarter of the men who've been president have either been assassinated or have had serious assassination attempts or almost president. In the case of President Trump, he was going to be the nominee. That's a lot. When you think about it, that's a lot. So we are very fortunate.  Now let me just say to President Trump, God bless you. Thank God. Thank God you're here. That's all I have to say. I want to get to this issue of this Zoran Mondani. Please stop calling him a Democrat Socialist. I don't care if they call him that. I don't care if that's his party. He's a Marxist Islamist. Socialism is an economic ideology. He's bigger than that. He's a Marxist.  He's not a Democrat in any respect. He's an Islamist. Everything he says, everything he supports, he's an Islamist. He's a radical extremist.  who preaches violence, who preaches a lot of things that are horrendous. He founded a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. That's a Hamas front organization. He refuses to reject the term globalize the Intifada. Intifada is a worldwide terrorist, violent, murder operation against Jews and other people in the West.  He was part of the BDS movement, which is an economic movement that is intended to starve the state of Israel. He's an anti-Semite. He's a racist. He's a bigot. You name it. He's all those things that we reject. Just because he doesn't walk around without a white robe and a white hood, or just because he doesn't walk around with the sign of the Third Reich on his chest, or does a salute, doesn't mean he's not any of those things. And I'm here to tell you he's all of those things, OK?  We cut to the chase here. His father, Mahmoud, he's called for the end of the state of Israel. The end of the state of Israel means the elimination of the Jews. They think they're going to go somewhere? Now, this man has refused to sign a resolution recognizing the state of Israel. He defended Yemeni-American al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki. He excused him as being  pushed into extremism by the FBI that was surveilling him. This guy was a big Al-Qaeda guy, big Al-Qaeda guy, even before 9-11. He was an imam in northern Virginia. Two of the hijackers were part of his mosque. He fled the country to Yemen after the 9-11 attack, and Obama took him out. This guy made excuses for him. What do you think of that, America? He wants free rent.  free childcare, free public transportation, city-owned grocery stores, food ops. He believes in the seizure, which is force, the seizure of the means of production. No billionaires. Well, what's he going to do with them? Lock them up? He won't have any billionaires anyway. They'll all move to Florida. So who's he going to tax?  He believes in replacing private property rights and the market system with a government-run system, a communal living system. Boy, that doesn't sound too new to me. I think every Marxist regime on the face of the earth has tried it. He despises the NYPD.  He says he's not going to allow them to assist ICE. He wanted to defund them. Now he pretends he doesn't, but he does. We know who he is. He wants to replace police with mental health professionals. Well, maybe you ought to visit one of them. He's justified the burning of Minnesota. He said it has to happen in 2020. He believes black and brown solidarity, I quote, will overcome white supremacy. I told you he's a racist. He's a bigot.  Increase property taxes in, quote, richer and whiter neighborhoods. Well, other than the fact that that's unconstitutional taxing based on race, maybe he's missed the last hundred years or so. Freeze rents for multiple years at a time. Thirty dollars an hour minimum wage. Oh, that's that's brilliant. Big tax hikes on businesses, small, large, all kinds of businesses. So the guy is a Marxist Islamist. That's what he is.  Now, I want to remind Americans about capitalism and freedom and constitutionalism. What's that delivered? Because our media doesn't do it. All we have are these clowns, these fools. Guy's 33 years old. He hasn't accomplished a damn thing in his life. He's never run a fryer at a McDonald's, which is a good job. He's never had one.  So they push ideology. That's all they're about. Not world experience, not knowledge, none of that stuff. And this is a radical, radical kook. This is a bad dude. I want to remind you, and I'm going to my new book, On Power, by the way, and we will talk about this in the weeks ahead because I think it's a powerful book. It's very important for our time.  And I write in here, Economist George Reisman, in his 1996 book Capitalism, makes an overwhelming case for the universal benefits of capitalism. We Americans don't make the case for our country, our economic system, our governing system, our history. Instead, we're constantly defending ourselves and responding to these reprobates.  How about we make the case for the greatest country on the face of the earth, the greatest economic system on the face of the earth? Let me start. Let's try it this way. Industrial civilization has radically increased life expectancy.  In the 20th century in the United States, it has increased life expectancy from about 46 years in 1900 to the present 75 years, even more than that now. This was written 10 years ago by the professor. The enormous combination of industrial civilization to human life is further illustrated by the  the fact that the average newborn American child has a greater chance of living to the age of 65 than the average newborn child of a non-industrial society has of living to the age of five. The marvelous results have come about because of an ever-increasing supply of food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and all the conveniences of life. The progressive reduction in human fatigue and exhaustion. All of this has taken place on a foundation of actual science, technology,  Capitalism, which had made possible the continuous development and introduction of new and improved products and more efficient methods of production. Yes, which is why the communist regimes are always trying to steal our technology, because they can't do it on their own. And by the way, I watch this guy walk around, he's in a car, he's got a nice suit. Where the hell does he think that comes from? Capitalism.  Let's go on.  This same industrial civilization has produced the greatest abundance of clothing and shoes and housing in the history of the world. And while some people in the industrialized countries may be hungry and homeless, it is certain that no one in the industrialized countries needs to be hungry or homeless.  Industrialized civilization has also produced the iron and steel pipe, the chemical purification of pumping systems, and the boilers that enable everyone to have instant access to safe drinking water, hot or cold, every minute of the day. It has produced the sewage systems and the automobiles that remove filth from human and animal waste from the streets of cities and towns. It has produced vaccines and anesthesias.  Well, you can even fly through the air at 600 miles per hour, 40,000 feet up, watching movies and sipping martinis in air-conditioned comfort as they do so. In the United States, most people can have all this, in spacious homes or apartments, carpeted and fully furnished, with indoor plumbing, central heating, air conditioning, refrigerators, freezers, gas and electric stoves. And people have all this, as well as long life and good health, as a result of working 40 hours a week.  never before in human history. Indeed, as I write, in the United States, a walk through a neighborhood supermarket, itself a word unheard of less than a century ago, a neighborhood supermarket, makes available to anyone and everyone more abundance and choices of food, beverages, over-the-counter pharmaceutical products, cleaning products, and toiletries, among other things, from every corner of the country and the planet, packaged to ensure their freshness and safety than at any time in human existence.  An assembly line worker, plumber, electrician, bus driver, and janitor had more material goods at their fingertips than Caesar, King George III, and Stalin ever did or could have imagined. Marxism is incompatible with limited government and representative government and shared power. It's about the centralized coercive control to re-engineer society, to rejigger humanity. Marx wrote about  the invidious nature of individual liberty. He mocked our Declaration of Independence. The Islamists, basically the fundamentalists, they're throwbacks to the 7th century. They reject the Enlightenment. They reject the West. Read what their scholars say. So in this, the Marxists and the Islamists  are together. They're about coercion. They're about control. They're about centralization. They don't want debates and things of this nature. So you have this combination of Marxism and Islamism. If you read Stalin's 1936 constitution, it sounds like this guy's campaign promises. Stalin was a mass murderer.  Yet in 1936, he puts out this constitution about equality and all these rights and a free press, and they're going to give printing presses to organizations, they're going to have a union.  He was a liar. He didn't do any of these things. This guy's a liar. He's going to try and do these things. He won't accomplish them, but he will destroy the city in the meantime because it will depopulate. People who work hard and have homes, people who work hard and have even small businesses, a pizzeria, a deli, or big businesses, billionaires who obviously create things and invest capital  You don't have a skyline because of poor people. You have a skyline because of wealthy people. And those wealthy people, they're able to sell condominiums and rent apartments and create jobs. You need people who know what to do with steel and aluminum and cement. All these jobs, all these blue-collar jobs, all the benefits, the pensions, they all go away. People in that respect, like liberty, it's like water.  People will go where they have to go to accomplish what they want to accomplish and live the way they want to live. New York City will be depopulated. The state will be depopulated. So who's left to tax? The average person's going to be taxed. They're going to be impoverished. They won't have jobs. It's about time that we constitutional conservatives  defend our belief system rather than simply condemn the other one, that we compare and contrast. You know what you lose when these types of people are elected? Your liberty.  You know what you lose? The nuclear family. This wokeism is a new form of communism. It didn't just create itself. As I wrote in American Marxism, it's an Americanized, customized, tailorized form of Marxism to destroy the nuclear family. Why destroy the nuclear family? Because Marx, their hero, said, you must destroy the nuclear family. Why? Every social construct must be destroyed. The nuclear family, business communities,  Private property, all of it must be destroyed so we can find our paradise. Meanwhile, these people get rich. They get powerful. They rule with an iron fist. And so that is what's going on. That's what's at stake in this election in New York. And let me say something to the current mayor in New York, to Cuomo, and to my friend Curtis Sliwa. Cuomo, you have more baggage than JFK Airport.  and you run a lousy campaign in the Democrat primary, what makes you think you could win anything? And Mayor, you've been weak, you've been incompetent, and you're running very poorly. Curtis Sliwa, you're a dear friend. You're a Republican. So Republicans are not appreciated necessarily in New York, although Giuliani was and Bloomberg was before he made four switches to different parties and so forth. You three guys better get together, and you better figure out who runs against this guy.  or he will win by a plurality, not a majority, and it will be your fault. I hate to be blunt, but everything's at stake right now. Everything. This guy is a Marxist Islamist."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 986.176, "text": "Enough of this democratic socialism claptrap."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": null, "SPEAKER_01": null, "SPEAKER_02": null, "SPEAKER_03": null, "SPEAKER_04": null, "SPEAKER_05": null, "Sam Schweppe": null, "Secretary of State Marco Rubio": null, "Selena Zito": null, "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Senator Chuck Grassley": null, "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer": null, "Senator Patty Murray": null, "Senator Susan Collins": null, "Stephen A.

You know, very often good data out of China lifts the luxury sector. So here's the tariffs are overshadowing that today. So most of the sector is in the red.  Hermes is taking a little bit of a harder hit. They got a downgrade today from Jefferies. And it's part of a broader story that the luxury market has been in a bit of a downturn. More tariffs, more concerns about the global economy are preventing any kind of recovery coming through for the luxury market.

They got very good results from it, so it met all of the endpoints that were required in the trial that they just had. So it puts it on the path to potentially becoming a kind of blockbuster drug. So AstraZeneca shares up about 2%, and actually that's helping to lift the UK's FTSE 100 into positive territory today.

They run the monetary policy. There are reasons for doing that. But I think the fundamental takeaway for the public is this cut in interest rates is not done from a position of strength.

But you're right. From the point of view of developing policy, we need, even though the election is a long way away and we won't firm them up until obviously the election campaign, we put our manifesto together,  We do want to hear a bit more from Kemi about the principles we have. She's been very clear she's on the side of the makers in society. She wants to have a society that's based on self-reliance, a society where the state is rewired so it's much more effective in delivering services at lower cost for the taxpayer. Doing that work takes time, but yes, I think in the months and weeks ahead, certainly a conference in an hour after, you'll start hearing a bit more policies on a lot of areas. Because you'll be keeping an eye on reform in the opinion polls. And Labour and the Liberal Democrats  and everything. So reform strength is people's frustration with politics. And it is palpable that people feel the politicians aren't up to the mark. That's why the Conservative Party, having received such a severe red card in the last session, we've got to do that hard work. And Tory's obviously moving over to reform.  We've seen that all the time. And Labour and Tory's moving to different parties because we need the Conservative Party. Our job in the Conservative Party is to learn the lessons, hear what people said, and do the hard work that Kemi Badenoch has said, to say, think fundamentally about how we want to present ourselves in the next election so we can regain the trust, not just in the Conservative Party, but that politics can be an effective way for people to achieve outcomes.

If these protesters, these people with purple hair, with a nose ring, living in their parents' basement, who don't work and want to go protest such, they're getting paid by people. If they think they're going to stop ICE or stop Border Patrol from doing their job, they got another thing coming. Because every time they double down, we're going to triple down. I had 1,000 protesters at my house about a month ago.  Good for them. I wasn't even there, my wife's in Italy, so what the hell are they doing? They said they weren't very smart.

And for those people who say, well, this mass detention, this mass detortation operation, what a racist and un-American thing to say. No, no, no, no.  We just spent four years of massive illegal migration, where 10.5 million illegal aliens came to this nation, to our borders. They're demanding due process. They're demanding the right to claim asylum. They demand the right to see a judge. OK. But at the end of that process, he says, you're going home? You're going home, because that's due process.  We don't have a choice. What's the choice? Let them stay? Is that the choice? Because if you don't show consequences, you're never going to fix the problem, and the next president comes in and undoes all the success we're doing. Bottom line is, we're going to enforce the law, unlike the last administration. We're going to hold people accountable.  We will continue to prioritize public safety threats and national security threats, because they're the most important and most dangerous to the community. But I'll say it again, if you're in the country illegally, you're on the table.  It's not OK to enter this country illegally. It's a crime. It's not OK to ignore a judge's order of deportation. We're looking for you. We got over 600,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records walking the streets of this nation.

But our warriors understand you never get 1776 without 1775 when the first Americans picked up their rifle and said, this I will defend.  Ideas are important. They're critically important if you look at the difference between this administration and the previous. Ideas are what Turning Point's all about, back to basics, our founding principles. But if you're not able to defend those principles, you give them away, either to foreign enemies or domestic ideologies that have a very different view of our country.  And so at the DOD, we're back to basics, to the Constitution. We don't do politics. We do war fighting on behalf of the American people to keep everybody safe. Sound good? We're also rebuilding our military.  in ways that President Trump did in his first term under Obama and Biden, the military was gutted, not just with bad ideologies, but with insufficient funding and capabilities. President Trump's changed that. The one big, beautiful bill gave $150 billion in additional spending to DOD. We have the first trillion-dollar defense budget.  Listen, let me tell you, I'm a fiscal hawk like a lot of people in here, too. I want to make sure taxpayer dollars are used wisely. And that's why I think Doge and entities like that have been used as efficiently or even more aggressively in DOD than anywhere else. Because every dollar I can find in savings is a dollar I can reinvest  in war fighting and readiness and capabilities, in the pointy end of the spear. So we've found tens of billions of dollars in savings that we've, contracts we've eliminated, green initiatives that are gone, that we move over to President Trump's priorities. So when you look at Golden Dome for America, protecting the homeland, you look at the F-47, the world's first sixth-generation fighter jet,  Drones, long-range fires, hypersonics, the way of war is changing. Our job is to see around the corner for you. Because those B-2 pilots, and by the way, the mechanics and the refuelers and the fighters, pilots don't fly themselves. It's like anything else. No one in the military serves themselves. A huge family and community supports them. But those B-2 pilots were able to fly in an exquisite machine  37 hours around the world because some American that I've never met 40 or 50 years ago designed that fighter, that bomber, was willing to spend political capital and effort and time to fund it and acquire it and field it so that a future president they'll never meet has maximum latitude and decision space to execute on behalf of the American people.  My job is to work with our team to look the same way. What does warfighting of the future look like so that you  And your kids and your grandkids in future America have the capabilities they need to be decisive and overwhelming on the battlefield. It's not just about the wars of today and how successful are we today, but are we making the tough call? See, it's easy to be aggressive and forward-leaning in this position when you have a boss in President Trump who puts a giant shield over you.  And that's what it is. He ultimately is willing to take the slings and arrows. He's literally taken the shots so that the rest of us can go into our departments and say, now is the time to do what needs to be done.

So have things really changed or is this a kind of brotherly spat with the Kremlin?  My own reading, I think it is an unravelling of the US attempts to end the war in Ukraine via the ceasefire, big beautiful ceasefire, which would have put Donald Trump, as he saw it, on that road to the Nobel Peace Prize, and he could have said he'd made a real difference there. I think he realised over time that Vladimir Putin was not remotely serious about that. He wants to press on in Ukraine, he has military goals, he has an ideological take on Ukraine, that it needs to come back  into the Russian family and effectively be run at arm's length from Moscow. So that's not going to change. What could change, and as you say, it depends really how the Kremlin responds as well, is if the administration is signalling this disillusionment with Vladimir Putin's refusal to negotiate, does that mean that Kiev can be emboldened to change tack in the war? It's been on the back foot for rather obvious  reasons they're now talking about attacks going deep into Russia territory, they can do that far more safely for their own troops and civilians with Patriot air defence cover.

Let's get back into the big picture politics of Rachel Reeves in a moment, but I'm very struck by one element of the rollout of this plan, Anne, which is in The Guardian this morning, because it's not Rachel Reeves who is the person who is sort of raising the curtain on it, but her Deputy Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones.  And he talks extensively about how this fund and initiatives like it are very, very personal to him. And it's really quite a personal interview, as it happens with Heather Stewart, the economics editor. And I'm quite struck, as it happens, that he makes it sound like it's him rather than Rachel Reeves, who's the driving force behind it. Now, I can almost hear Darren Jones, if he was listening to this, saying, oh, Sam, you're just talking tittle tattle. But there we go. I've said it anyway, because I bet you that was  in part his cheeky intention and even more pertinently he was unashamedly sort of boosting and talking up New Labour and his New Labour credentials which is just not a phrase that you hear government ministers talking about anymore at the moment. New Labour being a sort of code word for Blairite Blairism.  and the sort of Tony Blair approach. It wasn't something even that Gordon Brown loved at points, although he did ultimately adopt that mantra. He was saying, the council estate I grew up on was one of those neighbourhoods that was picked by the new Labour government because it was so deprived, essentially, in terms of income and educational outcomes. So he's attributing his success in life specifically to Blairite initiatives, and he's now looking to give some of that help for others.  and that phrase new labor comes up multiple times in the interview it feels like positioning it feels like he is planting a big uh new labor flag um again i'm sure that darren would call of that tittle tattle  But I have to be honest, Anne, I think that Darren is one of the best media performers in the Cabinet, even if he's not necessarily one of the most popular people amongst his Cabinet colleagues. But he doesn't do these things by accident, and it will be noticed. And a lot of things that Darren does is noticed, not least because  I'm going to grit my teeth and say it because I'm sure they'll be irritated by this but he is a much better media performer than his boss Rachel Reeves."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 620.385, "text": "You've made yourself popular this morning haven't you?

It's really bad to have this 100% GDP.  debt ratio, the social impact initiatives, you write that he praises the one that he benefited from as a child and wants to talk about also in that Guardian interview, the return of a new generation of public-private partnerships to fund these neighbourhood  health centres at the heart of Wes Streeting's 10-year plan for the NHS. It will set some hairs running that this is PFI under, if you like, a newer, newer Labour branding. But whether it's a TB tribute or a GB one, and I still tend to see Team Reeves as a bit more derivative of Gordonology on the whole,  It is a curtain raiser to a very important week for the Chancellor.

He does actually talk about Rachel Reeves in that interview. And whilst he is the guy pushing this anti-child poverty and anti-poverty strategy, he says, what Rachel is trying to do is walk that tightrope out of the kind of fiscal headache that they got. In other words, I'm the guy with the good news, while my boss is trying to navigate this incredibly difficult, not particularly popular path that's not going to please anybody.  It's almost like I'm the guy with the sweeties, but she's not. That's probably overstating it, but certainly I was struck by the way he talked about her. You talk about Team Reeves. It all depends whether or not you think that Darren Jones is actually on the same ideological page as Rachel Reeves. I'm not totally sure. I think instinctively he's a little bit more to the right of her in Labour terms.  but we will see. What Rachel Reeves won't be able to avoid is, of course, a discussion about what taxes are going to be raised. Heidi Alexander, the new-ish Transport Secretary, was out and about, not least on Trevor's programme on Sky yesterday, and she was very conspicuously refusing to take wealth taxes off the table when she was asked about it by Trevor. She said that they weren't directly discussed at a cabinet away day last week.  And that sort of slightly curious formulation, which sort of leans into it, has made a lot of the page ones this morning. You know, wealth taxes are exactly what Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, unions, some MPs have been pushing for some kind of tax on unearned income, savings, investments or property.  As it happens, I don't think they've worked out how to fill a black hole left behind by the welfare cuts, capitulation and lower growth. But as a party management technique, sort of half hinting that you're looking at it, maybe isn't the most stupid idea in the world."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 822.065, "text": "I like the idea of it not being directly discussed, like you'd have an indirect discussion about a wealth tax by hinting at it. That might be the problem with that if it is a way of managing backbench  sentiment Sam because if you raise that, more and more people start to talk about it and then don't deliver it. I wonder what you've gained there but possibly I'm missing something. I have often thought for quite a long time now that if it's Neil Kinnock suggesting something, particularly in the fiscal space, it's not going to happen. I do think he's in a different place.  in his head. I do, sorry. Well, no, I mean, I very much enjoy Neil Kinnock's company. I've had many spirited interviews and exchanges with him, but I just don't feel he is where, you know, where the government is in its gut on this kind of issue. That said, money is going to have to come from somewhere, isn't it? And directly taxing savings and investments, I think would be quite a tricky path to go down. You can already see the backlash  to the possible plan that he's been patrolled by Rachel Reeves to cut those ISA thresholds and to radically bring down the amount of the ISA dosh you can stick in there without paying tax on it. But there is a rate coming on better-off earners. We all know that pension tax relief, I would suggest, is high, high, high on that list, and that could be pretty swinging. I'm told by a money manager who deals with these things that the EIS scheme is still  pretty safe as he understands it from the Treasury because it's getting people invested in UK firms and startups and growth. And I think if Rachel Reeves were to go after that, people would say, well, what is your overall message? You wanted us to put less into ISIS to invest in the British economy. You can't then start to  and slap us on tax relief there, but that also does cut off a place where people have a bit of money to invest in not paying tax. But the wealth tax as a direct levy, would Keir Starmer want that on his political record going into the next election? I'm not so sure. What do you think?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 948.523, "text": "One of the interesting things about wealth taxes is that specifically Rachel Reeves seemed to keep ruling them out. She's done that in this parliament, she did that in the run-up to the election.  So in the light of Heidi Alexander's comments, does she default to what she said before? Does she leave a little bit more wiggle room? I mean, there is a chance that every single front page dies within a matter of hours, right? So I'm actually genuinely interested when this pool interview happens mid-morning, what happens?  Look, the IFS has been very clear that it basically poo-poos wealth taxes as a whole because it's very difficult to create a new form of taxation. How do you assess the asset base against which you're taxing and all the rest of it? We have a wealth tax in this country, that's council tax. This government appears to be sticking to its decision to rule out a revaluation and a recalibration  of that, but so many things feel like they're in the too tricky box for this government and I haven't yet seen the kind of bravery in any of the various fields and the sort of political might and will that would be needed to get something like this over the line. So I'm thinking that there will be more traditional answers to the problem of how to fill this back hole than a wealth tax when it comes.  But all over the place though, you know, this government feels quite hemmed in. Do you remember in the run-up to this government's election, one of the key things they told us was how there was going to be greater reliance on the Office for Budget Responsibility because the OBR wasn't used by Liz Truss before her mini-budget. That blew up. Literally there was a piece of legislation that has gone through Parliament to stop that happening again.  Well now the IMF has come out and said, maybe you only need to get the OBR to assess your forecast once a year. And in the papers this morning, there's a whole bunch of red wall MPs going, yeah, really Rachel, you have to dial down your reliance on the OBR.  And it sounds like she is minded to maybe go from two OBR forecasts to one a year, meaning that there's only one moment where she can be judged to have missed her fiscal rules and have to find more money from taxes, spending cuts, or probably not welfare anymore. So they're running in the sort of opposite direction. All of this just reflects the sort of lack of thinking that happened in opposition and the fact that they are now forced to recalibrate again and again."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1093.413, "text": " It sure does. I mean, you remember all of those sort of swingy statements that the OBR was critical of the last Tory government and that, of course, when Labour came to power, there would be fiscal rectitude and the OBR would be a gold standard. Well, that has certainly been  turned into a sort of, yeah, well, you know, we listen to the OBR, but not quite so much. I suppose, to be fair, as you use the phrase hemmed in about Rachel Reeves and the government when it comes to matters economic and financial, if something is going to have to change,  and you change that so you get a bit, you know, somehow you buy yourself real room there without actually changing your fiscal rules. You could say how many people outside the bubble will really notice that and say, you know what, I'm really not going to vote Labour anymore because they stopped listening to the OBR twice a year.

Let me zoom out a little bit and provide some broader historical context. The left has been trying to shove Marxism, socialism and communism down the throats of the American people for generations now.  They ultimately were not able to do this during the Cold War because the middle class revolted against communism and Marxism and social engineering. The left shifted their tactics. The Democratic Party shifted their tactics to use migration as a weapon to break down the middle class and to gain political power and control in this country.  They use migration to destroy our public education system, to destroy our health care system, to destroy wages and working conditions for the middle class of this country, and in effect to destroy social and community cohesion. And then in that rubble,  in that chaos, in that conflict, to then try to articulate the need for ever more government control, ever more government redistribution, ever more government power, and then to ultimately import voters to then support that agenda, to import voters who do not believe in limited government, who do not believe in the U.S. Constitution. And that is why you are seeing now this violent, yes, violent insurrectionist revolt  by the Democrat Party against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. You see video after video after video of Democrat shock troops in the streets hurling rocks at ICE officers and Border Patrol in their vehicles, firing projectiles at them, violently assaulting them, and yes, opening fire on them.  multiple assassination attempts against our brave and heroic ICE and Border Patrol agents, and barely a word of condemnation from the Democrat Party. In fact, the Democrat rhetoric, calling our ICE officers, calling our Border Patrol Nazis and Gestapos and fascists, demanding as they do that ICE leave their communities, this nullificationist rhetoric,  all of which inspires and incites these domestic terror attacks against law enforcement. So we really are at a hinge point here for the West.  A fulcrum point. President Trump campaigned and won on a historic mandate to empower ICE and Border Patrol, to restore the sovereign enforcement of our laws, and to get illegal and criminal aliens out of our country. He is delivering on that mandate each and every day. And now we see violent terrorist attacks against ICE and Border Patrol to try to slow their progress. So we need all patriotic Americans  to speak with one clear voice in support of ICE and Border Patrol, in support of President Trump, so that we can carry out and fulfill this mandate that Americans voted for at the ballot box just a few months ago."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 213.155, "text": "So brilliantly put.

The road ahead will not be easy. I can attest personally that in my work as the Director of National Intelligence, the deep state is fighting us every step of the way.  And it exists within every single federal agency. And so I feel the same frustration that I see many of you expressing on X or in different platforms about why aren't things going faster? Why aren't we getting results more quickly? I feel this frustration every single day. We are pushing hard. Know that they are pushing hard back. It's okay. We're not going anywhere.  We're here to fight for you and to fight for the red, white, and blue that's behind you. We can't do this alone. It will take all of us who love our country and who deeply cherish our freedoms to stand united in this fight.  It's going to come with hardship and sacrifice. As you know, it comes with name-calling and smears and lies and attacks. But here's the beautiful thing, is the harder they push back, the more smears and lies that are published in the Washington Post and the New York Times and the Atlantic and many others, the more we know that we are exactly on the target.  And on those days where you might feel a little tired, and you might feel a little discouraged, and we all get there at some point in time, I go back and think about what President Trump has been through. He has sacrificed more than anyone else. He has been attacked and targeted more than anyone else. And most significantly, one year ago tomorrow was the day in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a gunman tried to take his life missing by just a hair.  And so on those days when you feel like you're not quite sure if you have any more fight left in you, think back to that day when he popped right up. He was not cowed. He was not afraid. He was not running away. What did he do? He raised his fist and looked at all of the people who were there just as you are here today. And he said, fight, fight, fight. Fight, fight, fight.  And that's exactly what we have to continue to do. Not motivated by hate for those who are trying to take our freedoms away, but by love. I know President Trump is motivated deeply by his love for our country. This is where his strength and his resilience comes from.  He is motivated deeply by his care for every one of you, every one of us, the American people, and his commitment to make the most of every single day that he has in the White House, to bring about this reality of a country where we can live in peace, with prosperity and security and freedom for all Americans. This is why I'm so grateful to be able to  to have earned President Trump's trust and confidence to be able to serve as a member of his cabinet in the role that I am in because we have a lot of work to do.  So the thing I want you to go home with is the knowledge that you, not a single one of you, should underestimate the power of your voice and your energy and your work and your role in bringing about this historic change that we have all embarked on together. Don't let anyone ever tell you that this is not your time or that you're too young or maybe you'll go and do something in a few years or five or 10 years or 20 years."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker warns of a difficult road ahead, asserting the existence of a \"deep state\" within federal agencies that is actively resisting their efforts.

Number one, this fusion of Marxism and Islamism that we see in New York in the streets, in our colleges and universities, in the politics and so forth and so on, the United States and the West really has had its guard down for a long time. Isn't that part of the problem when it comes to immigration and education and all the rest of it?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 43.771, "text": " Absolutely it is. I mean, the amazing thing is, Mark, that all of these things are getting worse, certainly in the case of the mayoral race in New York that you just mentioned. But people like you have diagnosed these problems for decades, for decades. I mean, we have known for even longer, we've known for 50, 60 years, the rot in the universities, for instance. We've known about this, and yet it gets worse and worse.  The key thing, as I've written about in a number of my books, has been that we have been inculcating, spreading, indoctrinating a new generation of Americans into anti-Westernism. And anti-Westernism can be anti-United States of America, it can be anti-capitalism, it can be...  anti any number of things. But one of the things, of course, is it's always anti-Israel. And that's one of the reasons why we've seen this obscene meeting place, this extraordinary coalition of so-called progressives and the most regressive groups on the planet, terrorist groups, terrorist regimes.  These so-called progressive groups in New York that would like to think that they're the main force behind Mamdani, for instance, they think of themselves as progressives, but they fly the flags of terrorist groups. They chant support for martyrs. They call for Intifada, even though Intifada has killed, among other things, American students.  having coffee at a cafeteria in an Israeli university during the second intifada. Yet still, these people call for these things.

That is, the hate for the Enlightenment  hate for individual liberty, hate for capitalism, which is basically the economic manifestation of liberty. In other words, centralization of coercive power. That's what they stand for, right?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 188.93, "text": " Yes, absolutely. And it's all that old-fashioned Marxism, as you know.

I mentioned in my column in the New York Post this week, just consider the fact that Mamdani  The lead candidate to run the biggest, most important city in the United States of America, New York City, has called for the arrest of the Israeli prime minister if he were to set foot in New York City, has called the elected prime minister of India a war criminal.  Why would anyone single out these people? Why would somebody single out a Hindu leader and the world's only Jewish state's leader? It's because that's just Islamist sectarian politics. You never hear these people calling for the arrests of the Ayatollahs if they come to the United Nations General Assembly.  You never hear them calling for the arrest of the president of Turkey, who's literally still occupying half of Cyprus, which is an EU member state, and has been oppressing the stateless people, the Kurds. You never hear any of that. This is Marxism with this sprinkling of Islamist politics on the top. And, you know, many of us have always hoped that this coalition would fall apart under the weight of its own contradictions, because they are  absolutely manifold, the number of contradictions.

I guess the problem  Michael, with age restrictions and saying that there's a cut off, is that people age at different rates, don't they? I mean, Donald Trump is only a couple of years younger than President Biden. And yet he looks to be much more physically fit. He certainly has much, much more energy than Joe Biden did. Look at Nancy Pelosi, former Speaker of the House, well over 80 years old, mentally very, very sharp.  But then her colleague Mitch McConnell, well, he was sort of freezing awkwardly last year. This week has been good bipartisan cooperation and a string of...  I think the fact that I just mentioned four very elderly politicians does prove the point that America does seem to have a problem with younger politicians withdrawing in a younger crowd.

But I do wonder whether  anyone in their 80s is in the absolute prime of their life. I'm not sure that they are.

But no, it is, you know what, it is a really good question because one of the reasons that Sky News chooses to continue to staff an LA bureau is on the one hand, it gives us, you know, a big geographical split. It's almost as far from DC to LA as it is from DC to London. So it allows us to cover more of the stories that we want to bring to our audience.  It's also, though, to be able to tell the story of how DC policies impact people outside the beltway. When you're in DC, and I lived in DC for 18 months, you're surrounded by the story. A lot of the people that you come across in coffee shops and restaurants, they're also journalists, lawyers, Capitol Hill staffers.  Here it's a lot more varied in terms of profession and in terms of demographic too, so you know under Biden sort of the day-to-day political chat with my friends here was limited, it's just not their world. What I have noticed though is since  Trump took over for a second time since his policies became more extreme. It is something, you know, I'm waking up to messages from my friends in LA asking about what he's doing, you know, because it is having a real life impact here that they can see in front of their eyes. They're seeing the protests. Particularly over the last few weeks here, these immigration raids have been intensifying. In fact, I was  up very early this morning doing a ride along with a group of people, ordinary citizens of LA, you know, high school teachers, school psychologists. And they began their day at 6 a.m. driving around the streets of the city looking for vehicles that belong to immigration agents who they believe are launching these raids on their neighbors. So, you know, I think people are becoming a lot more politically active in LA as a result of the Trump administration.  A question for you now, Mark. Charlotte from Tunbridge Wells, in fact, Charlotte asked several interesting questions. One of them is, what is it like being impartial journalists covering an era of fake news in the US and with DC increasingly filled with more politicised, partisan journalism and rhetoric? She asks whether it's, you know, hard or even nerve-wracking still asking those hard questions in DC."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 464.228, "text": " It's not nerve-wracking. I do think it's harder because there are more people who are asking questions that, well, they're often not asking questions, they're making sort of affirming statements to the principle that they are supposed to be questioning. And so because you've got more of those types of journalists in the room, it does make it harder  there's kind of less space for the more traditional interrogating questions. I mean, it's worth remembering that in the United States, the broadcast media is not bound by impartiality rules, that we're bound by television in the UK. And that's been the case for a long time. So that means that for many years, the media environment here in America has been quite different. It has been sort of very partisan.  And yet still, it has felt, you know, Fox News is always pretty right wing, MSNBC pretty left wing. That's the general consensus. But now there's a kind of new layer, because the new media here that is being encouraged into the White House are very often from from organizations that are extremely partial. So they're very, very pro Trump.  And very often the questions that they ask are not particularly, well then, as I say, they're not questions. And that's frustrating. And then you sort of combine that with the fact that there is a sort of weird deference to the office of the president here in America anyway.  And I get very frustrated that, I don't know about you, but that there are very few really probing questions to any of the Trump administration. So yeah, he's out there a lot.

They still have NBC, CBS.  ABC, CNN, all the rest of it, they're all still there. But there are a couple of tents where there is there are new media, that have that are real America's voice, I think is one of them. So there are some new media, but then inside the press room, again, the first two rows are still pretty much the same. But they've got this new media seat now. And they rotate it. And in principle, that's really nice, because  uh they've opened up the press room so more people can have access to it that's great it's really important that they are allowing you know podcasters to sit in a rotation in this new media seat also great none of that is bad what is frustrating and i think problematic is that very quite a lot of those people who  who get to be in that seat, they are not impartial, they're not asking impartial questions, they're not interrogating the president or the office of the president and so it just becomes like a whole load of nodding people.

That was almost immediately after  the unsuccessful assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. She was a supportive presence from then. She did, you know, appear more on the campaign trail, but she has definitely taken a backseat this term, staying out of the spotlight. When he became president, she said, you know, I will be splitting my time between Washington, D.C., New York and Florida. It seems like she spends a heck of a lot  more time in New York and Florida than she does in DC. She did have, you know, she does have these brief forays back into the spotlight. She actually championed a bill which is very laudable, criminalizing the spread of AI-generated deepfakes and revenge porn. It's a subject, you know, I've done some reporting on.

There was a briefing last week.  in Washington surrounding the Israeli Prime Minister's visit here.

That actually was an improvement because when we went into the briefing, we were told it was going to be off the record, which means that you can't actually report anything. You can just use some of the information to inform your reporting.  but you can't report anything that they actually say. Then when we got there, the person who was doing this briefing said, OK, actually, we'll do this on background, which means that you can quote me as a senior Israeli official.

The public transport network, you don't need me to tell you, is famously bad here.  There's been some work going on at the moment to build what's called a people mover at LAX, which is the city's main domestic and international airport. Incredibly, you can't get to LAX at all by train at the moment. So this people mover will connect the metro and the subway to it.  That is already underway. Who knows when it will be finished?

It doesn't really feel that way, does it? Even though economists tell us that inflation is dropping down again. Part of the reason for that is there's a lot going on beneath the surface. And I want to show you a few of those things, starting with inflation. And this is the chart. There's inflation, but it's not maybe the inflation chart that you typically tend to see. Because rather than looking at the annual change in prices, which is what economists tend to mean by inflation, this is looking at  the level of the price of goods, so the basket of goods and services we buy on a daily basis, this is how that's changed over time. And when economists look at inflation, when they talk about inflation, when the Bank of England talks about inflation, they're generally referring to the change over the past year. And you can see the difference between that and that. Well, that amounts to about three, three and a bit percent, 3.4% the latest numbers.  But when you and I go to the supermarket, we're typically not just thinking back at what's happened to prices in the last year, you're kind of thinking about what's happened to them in recent memory. And if you look back in recent memory, say the last four years...  It's up by 25%. So partly, it's this perceptual thing. Annual inflation may be going down, but actual inflation that we experience, that's still really high. But partly, it's because there's a lot of other things going on as well. That's showing you inflation. You've also got earnings. They're changing over the same period as well. You've got taxes going up as well. How does it all fit together? Well, let me just give you a kind of sense of this. And what this is showing you  is imagining in the future you've got about 10% increases over the next few years, which is what the OBR thinks is likely, for all different parts of the income spectrum. So from the poorest through to the richest, look at what happens when you take into account inflation. So that's 10% up in nominal terms. But you've got to address the fact that inflation digs into that.  Assume that inflation is basically hitting everyone equally, which of course it doesn't in practice. I'll show you that in a sec. But even if you assume that, those bars go down from 10% to 2.5%. But on top of that, you've got tax increases as well. So higher national insurance, you've got the fact that those tax thresholds are frozen as well. Take that into account and look at these bars.  So for the poorest, it's basically you're seeing your real take home pay frozen, flatlining. \u00a350,000 because you've got these different tax thresholds that kind of kicks in unequally. That's kind of basically flatlining as well. But that's not everything. On top of that, you've got to take into account higher council tax. And then when you put that into the equation as well, look,  Those on \u00a350,000 actually seeing it falling in terms of their real take-home pay. Similar thing, even greater, for those on \u00a313,000 when council tax is taken into account. So that shows you that inflation is only one part of this story. What we're feeling and what we're filling in our pockets is a very different story. And that is only one part. That's kind of actually, I guess, more complex than that.  If you look, for instance, that last one just broke it down by income brackets, but you can break it down even further. You can look at people's different circumstances. So what about the difference between pensioners? What about the difference between people who own properties and not? That's looking at the overall increase in that period, real household disposable income. But now, after housing costs, which are pretty expensive,  For per person, including pensioners, it's going up, so it looks like it's better. But why is that? It's partly because a lot of people who own their home outright, particularly pensioners, don't have to pay as much in housing costs. For those who are not pensioners, particularly people who are private renting, particularly people who are paying mortgages,  Actually, over that same period, you're seeing the amount of take-home pay going down. So again, it depends on your circumstances. It might be that you are seeing your take-home pay go down, partly because of inflation, partly because of taxes, partly because of other factors as well. And I said a moment ago, everyone's experience of inflation is actually kind of different.  That's true. This is showing you the proportion of inflation of your spending that goes on different essential items. So stuff like food and drink, clothing, footwear, childcare, household bills. And for low to middle income households, look at how high those layers are. And now compare it to higher income households, which is over there.  You see the issue here. So for lower income households, you're spending more of your average spending on essentials, which is not the case for higher income households. And that's changed. It's evolved over the years. So another way of showing basically the same thing. So from poorest fifth to the richest fifth, showing just how much of that total spending goes on essentials. That was in 2006. Look at these bars.  they have gone up over the years. So particularly, look over here, the poorest fifth in the last year or so, that bar has gone above the 50% point. So now you're spending more than a fifth of your spending on essentials because the price of those essentials has gone up and it's not equal across the income spectrum. So all of this stuff feeds in. It all feeds in and it's worth just saying,  When it comes to the nature of inflation and just how things have changed, inflation has become less equal as well. What this is showing you is from 2007 to 2019, how has inflation impacted from the poorest through to the richest? The thing to note about this is that line is relatively flat.  So it's been a kind of equal experience, or at least there was an equal experience up until 2019 in terms of how inflation affected people overall. But now look at the last few years, and that line is very different, isn't it? So it's higher for those in lower income deciles, so lower earners, and it's lower for richer, for bigger earners. You can see.  if those who are poorer have had to face higher inflation in recent years, which wasn't the case before. And of course, it depends on the kinds of things you're spending money on. But look, dig into the kinds of things that we do spend money on. And there are certain things that you can't really avoid that are going up quite a lot, like power, like electricity. So this is showing you the UK and how it compares to other developed economies in terms of our electricity costs. And look, red line is the UK. I'm going to bring it on there.  And just look how striking that is. We used to be kind of middle of the pack for a lot of recent years. And in the last year, the UK has gone out to be the highest cost domestic power nation around the world. So that's electricity. Worth saying, a lot of focus on that recently.  When it comes to food, actually, this is a comparatively cheap country. It may not feel like it a lot of the time, but actually, same thing again. We're comparing the UK with other G7 nations, and actually, the UK is cheaper than the average of other G7 nations. So we pay much more for power, not much less, but less, certainly, when it comes to food.  Of course, those aren't the only essentials. There are other essentials that you need to think about. One that we're going to be talking about quite a lot in the next few months is water, and this is showing you just how much extra water bills are going to dig into people's earnings, again, from the richest through to the poorest. Those red bars are showing you just the cash amount that's going to come out of your bill or go on top of your bill in the coming years.  But of course, cash doesn't tell you the full story. You need to look at it as a percentage of what you're actually spending. And if you look at it that way, the line here, it's very different. The richest, of course, spend in terms of the proportion increase, spending the least, whereas it's poorer families who are going to be paying more as a share of their income when it comes to these extra water bills. So you can see how it all tots up. And the overall picture that we're left with  It's quite striking. Take it all into account. This is showing you who's getting better off, worse off in the coming years, different household groups. Here's something quite striking. Pensioners are seeing their real household disposable income going up, or at least projected to go up in the coming years. For children,  it's going down. And again, we can break it down even further, social renters, those who own outright, working age, owning with a mortgage, going up gradually, and children, and indeed also private renters, seeing their amount of real household disposable income going down over that period, underlining that for many people, yes, the cost of living crisis is still very real, and it's gonna feel real for quite some time."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Andrew Ball": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Laura": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The main speaker delves into the intricacies of the cost-of-living crisis.

The Secret Service says it's made major changes since that day, and they do have new leadership. Also, another new Senate report Mike back out here live, says the Trump team asked several times to have more security while they were on the trail because they said President Trump's life was in danger several times, but the Secret Service denied those requests. Rather, now the family of Corey comparator who lost his life in that field and Butler hopes that these Senate reports get them the answers they want.

So markets are now dealing with a new threat of tariffs on U.S. imports. Last Friday, President Trump declared a 30 percent tariff on goods from both the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1st. It was just the day before Trump threatened Canada with a 35 percent tariff.  So markets have been somewhat well-behaved, as if they're counting on Mr. Trump to back down, having seen U-turns before. The question is whether that remains the best bet. In a moment, we'll travel to Singapore and speak with Bloomberg MarketsLive strategist Mary Nicola.  We begin in the States, though, as we look ahead to second quarter earnings. Joining me now is Rod VanLipsy. He is Managing Director at UBS Private Wealth Management on the line from Washington, D.C. Rod, thank you so much for making time to chat with me. So, earnings from a couple of the big banks are on the list this week. We'll also get numbers from TSMC and Netflix.

The estimates right now on the street, we're looking at under 5% earnings for EPS growth year-over-year. We at UBS believe we're going to come in closer to about 6% when we look at 2025.  and growing to call it $265 a share on the S&P 500. I think that this busy week, you know, you're really going to see some acceleration in the earnings reports. You know, for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the big banks really start to kick off on Tuesday. And our expectation is that those estimates are going to beat consensus. They're going to be pretty strong.  In one case, because the higher interest rates, especially for financials, have been very, very supportive of NII and net interest income and net interest margin for these banks. So we'll see some good numbers there. And I expect that some of the economic activity has been pulled forward in this second quarter.  especially since tariffs have been threatened and delayed and postponed. So lots of activity, but it's going to be a strange one. And everyone is going to be looking at not just the second quarter results, but what will be the forecast for third quarter and looking forward."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 157.362, "text": "Before we leave the banks, I want to ask about whether trading revenue has the potential to be a real standout here, given the volatility that we had in markets in the second quarter, whether banks really benefited from that on the trading side."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 170.958, "text": " Anecdotally, Doug, absolutely.

And so that works into our economic forecast numbers. But the commodity prices, quite frankly, are just all over the charts because of the dramatic uncertainty. Most of our investors are focused on commodities like gold and oil and don't dig too far into the commodity indices. But when we look at commodities, they truly are really all over the charts because it's very difficult to understand how the policy and the tariffs and the trade considerations will affect those utter blank commodities.  But I think it manifests itself, at least in our forecasts, on inflation that remains fairly pernicious and stays above the Fed's stated 2% target."}, {"keywords": ["Tariffs"], "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 280.296, "text": "Interesting.

We see, for example, GDP growth in the Americas for 2025, we're estimating, you know, one and a half percent GDP growth, but we're looking at CPI or inflation. And, you know, can we have some releases this week that will tell us, but we see inflation coming in almost at 3% and actually accelerating into 2026.  And that is directly because of this concern about how tariffs are going to flow through to the consumer and how they're going to keep inflation fairly high. Now, the markets seem to be unfazed by the tariff talks. The markets seem to believe that we're going to get to August 1st and either we'll have a favorable outcome or things will get pushed back again. And so they are completely unfazed, at least if we look at the, you know, at all time highs and continuing to be there.  And so on a macro level, we think that this bull market that we've been experiencing continues to have legs. It continues to have momentum. But the real place to keep an eye out is going to be the bond market. Because at some point in time, a lot of the things that were in the big, beautiful bill, a lot of the things that are coming into the economy because of increasing tariffs, at some point in time, the bond market is going to give us a signal.

These are actually attractive levels.  especially when you look at spreads for high quality municipal bonds for taxable investors in the U.S. or corporate bonds. We're seeing an opportunity there to get nice returns, but that does not mean it's not going to be volatile in the short term. And that's the real challenge for the bond investor is to take a look at it.  pick your yield, say this is the yield that I think is going to work, and recognize that next week, next month, that might feel like a bad decision, but by next year, you'll be glad that you're sitting on that high quality paper."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 435.67, "text": "Does the big beautiful bill at any point in the future begin to negatively impact the muni market, particularly at the state level?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 444.603, "text": " Well, that's a fantastic question, and I think that that has been structurally appears to be something that's been pushed down the road a little bit.

And so that is going to create some challenges. It's going to create pressure for things that are being put on states and municipalities. There's been a lot of  bond issuance, especially by municipal issuers there this year to try to get out in front of this before rates potentially go up.

I think one of the questions is whether the international equity markets, especially the Eurozone, whether it's fully caught up or is there more room to grow? We think that selectively looking offshore, holding foreign currency, holding gold, that those are nice hedges, but when it comes to actually making an investment that'll outperform the US markets, that becomes a little bit more of a murky question.  very, very difficult to us to look at European equity market growth and U.S. equity market growth, especially when we look at the focus of IT and financials here in the U.S. and believe that there's a lot of room for outperformance there in the developed international markets. Emerging markets, both on the debt and the equity side, do show some grain shoots and do show some very, very strong either  sovereign balance sheets or good positions for these corporations, but the path of tariffs will really, really make a difference. And so that makes it a little bit of a challenge for U.S. investors to go too deeply and go too far, either out-of-dollar investing or inter-international equities."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 601.372, "text": " House Republicans have declared the week ahead as crypto week, and I'm curious to get the take from the private wealth management perspective.

It's also very challenging for someone in a broker dealer, especially a big firm facing the Fed, to really understand the path and the fate of cryptocurrencies. I think three points, though. One is that these are certainly with us, and they're going to stay with us. I do believe that there are many of the cryptocurrencies themselves that are highly speculative,  And we are now starting to see a number of stable coins that are actually buying treasuries and basing them on treasury. And so one of the interesting things, interesting dynamics that we're seeing in the stable coin or the crypto assets is the purchase of treasuries.  Which is, if you had sort of thought about it initially or off the cuff, you would think that the crypto or emergence of more crypto options would actually be a move away from treasuries, when in fact the underlying securities and the underlying issuers are actually buying treasuries to make sure that they get that stability.  So I think that it's going to be a very, very interesting thing. Obviously, there's administration and on the Hill, there's support for crypto assets.

Rod, thank you so much for joining us. Rod Van Lipsy there, Managing Director, UBS Private Wealth Management on the line from Washington, D.C. here on the Daybreak Asia podcast.  Welcome back to the Daybreak Asia podcast. I'm Doug Krisner. So we know last Friday, President Trump declared a 30 percent tariff on goods from both the European Union and Mexico. They are effective August 1st, unless there is some sort of trade deal with both jurisdictions.  Over the weekend we heard from Ursula von der Leyen. She is the president of the European Commission and she said the EU will extend the suspension of trade countermeasures against the U.S. until August 1st and that in fact will allow for further trade talks. We also heard from Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum. She said that her team had already begun discussions with the U.S. on Friday.  Joining me now for a closer look at the tariff story is Mary Nicola, Bloomberg Markets Live strategist. Mary joins us from Singapore. It's always a pleasure to chat with you. I'm curious as to get your take on the tariff headwinds where you are and what's being said about whether President Trump may be bluffing."}, {"keywords": ["Tariffs", "Trade"], "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 779.869, "text": "Yeah, I think that  is very much the case, especially if you saw the way Asian equities had reacted last week. And it looked like they were shrugging off a lot of the noise that was coming through on tariffs. They shrugged off the noise on 50 percent on Brazil. Obviously, this morning, Japanese stocks are down. But actually, if you look at the Cosby in Korea, that's holding up quite well.  So there has been this disparity in terms of they're shrugging it off because doors are still open for negotiations. And I think that's key for markets. And also the fact that we could potentially see President Trump backpedaling. Also, the fact is that the data is holding up quite well. So I don't think you'll start seeing cracks  coming through into markets until we actually see some of the data come through fruition or the fact that you're seeing weakness coming through. And because we haven't seen that, it looks like the markets here in Asia are holding up relatively well."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 841.655, "text": " It's interesting, tonight here in the U.S., we had Trump saying that South Korea wants to make a trade deal. Now, that's coming from Mr. Trump's perspective. I'm not so sure that the same thing could be said for the South Korean side. Isn't it really difficult to kind of get a sense of where we are in the negotiating process?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 859.508, "text": " Yeah, it's interesting too, because if you look at Korea, the U.S. has a free trade agreement with Korea. So obviously the building blocks are solid and they're already there, but it's a matter of what more is the U.S. looking for. And I think that keeps coming up, especially in negotiations. So for example, with Japan, you've had a setback because of agriculture.  Agriculture is always a key sticking point when you're discussing trade negotiations and trade agreements, because obviously agriculture is considered some sort of national security issue as well. But for Korea specifically, it's interesting because you do have solid building blocks. You do have a free trade agreement. But of course, it's a matter of the 25 percent tariffs on cars. That's obviously a key sticking point.  for the Koreans and they want it to go away because obviously cars are a big part of what they're sending and what they're selling to the U.S. So unless those sectoral tariffs, which are still some of the bigger issues, go away, I think that might still hold Korea back and hold off an agreement between the two nations."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 931.058, "text": " So I'm curious, Mary, as to whether or not we have any data, high frequency or otherwise, that might give a little bit of insight into how this trade war is impacting not only Japan, but South Korea as well, economically.

And then also, if you look at the current account data, actually, all of them have been quite solid. So that's another key reason as to why the Asian Asian markets have been holding up relatively well.  Not to mention the fact that China as well has been holding up relatively well as well in addition to that. But if you look at some of the trade data coming out of Korea, there's no real indications that there has been a real slump, and that's really helping a lot of the markets. And I think as long as you see the strength in the current account, the strength in the external sector, that's going to keep equity markets, at least in the region, robust."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 993.833, "text": " So I know we get a couple of key data points for the Japanese economy this week, machine tool orders, industrial production.

Obviously, there's a lot of concern about inflation. There's a lot of concern about it, because especially we're seeing yields rise. And there's this toxic mix for Japan, whether you're seeing it because of quantitative tightening, whether you're seeing it because of inflation.  whether you're seeing it because of worries about fiscal proficacy and especially with the elections coming through and the potential for more fiscal spending. So there is really the heightened focus is on CPI. Is CPI still high? And of course, we know that the Bank of Japan has been quite reluctant  to hike rates. So real rates remain quite high. And as a result, I think you're seeing investors just incredibly wary of especially Japanese bonds. That's also going to weigh on the yen in addition.

And that has actually been to the detriment of the Japanese bond market and will likely hurt the yen as well.  But in the meantime, we are seeing quantitative tightening. And it's interesting to see the bond market reaction that despite the tweaks they've made. So, for example, the Ministry of Finance has already decided to reduce issuance in the back end. And we've seen some of those tweaks, yet we're still seeing pressure on bonds. So it's almost like they've let out their tools, but the tools aren't working.

We've seen the dollar slowly decline.  actually more than slowly declined since the start of this year. And I think that just precipitates it. And what you'll see is a switch over to a lot of the Asian currencies, for example, the CNY, the Korean won as well, where they're likely to get a bid as a result because of the fact that, you know, there is just this loss of credibility. Because if you do put someone  who is in that complies with what the fiscal policy and what the administration wants, that just risks where we could see inflation and how potential monetary policy just gets out of control.

There was a vehicle that was parked and one of the Secret Service agents had approached this person. My life was saved by a fraction of an inch. Well, it was unforgettable. I didn't know exactly what was going on.  It's been one year since that tragic day in Butler, Pennsylvania, when President Trump nearly escaped an assassin's bullet. Hello everyone, I'm Griff Jenkins, along with Lisa Booth, Alicia Acuna, and David Webb, and this is The Big Weekend Show.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the only threat against the president in the past year. Just two months later, Ryan Ruth, a second potential assassin, was caught with a gun at Trump's golf course in Palm Beach, Florida. Ruth has a long criminal record, including arrest for carrying a weapon without a permit and a hit and run charge. But Ruth and butler shooter Thomas Crooks aren't the only people who are targeting President Trump. A new book details an alarming threat.  They certainly have an elevated level of protection around him, even compared to other presidents. But I will say on the campaign trail, what we found was they had kill teams in the United States. The intelligence folks were telling them folks in the United States who wanted to kill him.  Joining us now, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. And Tricia, thank you for joining us. I mean, the question I want to start with is whether or not these potential threats have been apprehended, or is President Trump's life still in danger?

It is incumbent upon us to be extra honed and hardened in our investigations against the president, all of our leaders, and make sure that they're safe. And so we continue to reform the Secret Service, ensure that there's greater communication with state and local governments, especially on the ground in these heightened  threats and heightened situations and as well that there's greater accountability on the ground so that the agents know their zone and we can make sure that the president is safe, our leaders are safe and nothing like this ever happens again."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 179.108, "text": " Tricia David here.

But I will say, in those California raids,  particularly disturbing the number of politicians that came out and continued to villainize and attack and demonize our ICE law enforcement officers. At that particular operation, David, at those marijuana facilities, our ICE enforcement officers found 14 children, 10 who were unaccompanied.  They were likely being exploited, potential slave or forced labor, potential child and human trafficking. So this is something that is incredibly disturbing. It goes far beyond politics.

So that is in our vital interest. The president should be should be really pushing for that. He's tried to do it by being nice, by offering Putin a  a way out of the hole that Putin's dug for himself by, you know, offering to bring him back into the international community.
