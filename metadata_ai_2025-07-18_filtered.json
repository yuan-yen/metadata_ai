So when the Federal Reserve makes decisions, it has two things in mind. It has what does the employment picture look like and what does inflation look like.  And it's reacting to those two particular really substantive data questions. If you're in a universe where instead a Federal Reserve that's become politicized is reacting to what President Trump thinks that the interest rates should be, well, in that situation, you kind of break the relationship between what the Federal Reserve actually gets to set, which is the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to one another,  and things like mortgage rates or car loan rates or small business loan rates that are like actually relevant to consumers in this economy. So perversely by sort of trying to push so aggressively for an interest rate that is way outside of the realm of what any economic observers think makes sense in an environment where employment is basically  at 4-ish percent and inflation is still not back to target and in fact ticking upward because of this tariff policy. You really don't have any case to make for those type of rate choices outside of just politicization of the Federal Reserve which comes with real risks."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 88.608, "text": " I'm also hoping, Natasha, that you can give us a little bit more context here, too, because we have to keep in mind that the Fed chair is only one vote on the Federal Market Committee. And we did speak to Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who told us earlier this week on balance power that they are seeking for Powell to step down as chair, but also his position on the board.  Can you just give us a little bit could this complicate the administration's ultimate goal here when you do have other members who are voting and what we are hearing from those other members when it does come to the future of rate cuts?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 119.358, "text": "And you know it's like really important for your viewers I think and listeners to understand like there is no sort of button that the Fed chair pushes to change the interest rate.  The way that it works, as you're describing, is the Federal Reserve chair is one of 12 members on the Federal Open Markets Committee that makes decisions. They meet eight times a year. They make decisions on the trajectory of the interest rate. And importantly, these are decisions that are made by a group of people. And so the Fed chair, even if the president was effective at getting a Fed chair in who was going to push for his desired rate cuts that he's sort of trying to effectuate from the top in ways that break Federal Reserve independence,  Well, the rest of the board is going to be in a situation, and the rest of the committee is going to be in a situation where they're actually trying to push against exactly that impulse because they want to preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve, both because they are sort of institutionally very concerned about it, but also because only then can we be in a situation where we are actually trusted and credible as being reactive to inflation and being reactive to the employment picture.  And what's important for your viewers, listeners also to understand is we, in some sense, have run this experiment before. President Nixon put a ton of pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut rates in ways that would be short-term politically expedient. They did. And as a result of that, you saw inflation take up from 3% to 13% over the course of two years in ways that required a massive course correction.  and led to a significant downturn. So like, I don't think anyone should be rooting for that in this country. And it certainly goes against what the Trump administration is hoping to see from an economic perspective."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 222.105, "text": "Yeah, the historical context is important to keep in mind here, Natasha. And I appreciate you pointing that out. As you talk about the idea of trust and credibility for the Federal Reserve, I also wonder about the trust and credibility of the president as we consider his very frequently changing deadlines when it comes to tariff  and trade policy, because this is what the Fed is having to contend with, why it makes their decision making perhaps so hard. How do you at Budget Lab even try to game out the tariffs and the likely revenue we are going to be getting from them when the deadlines keep moving and the numbers keep changing? Is it even really possible to model"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "China"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 258.421, "text": " I mean, we are doing our best. My colleagues and I at the Budget Lab are sort of tracing every single twist and turn with respect to tariff policy in this country. And, you know, to our count, we've seen the effect of tariff rate change like almost 60 times over the course of the last several months as a result of the president's different political policies that have been pursued in this trade war.  The thing that I think is really important to grapple with, and you heard actually Governor Waller say a version of this. You've heard Chair Powell say a version of this as well. The president's been super specific. He would like to see interest rates lower. Chair Powell and the rest of the Fed have been pretty specific as well that in a world in which this sort of uncertainty associated with trade policy didn't exist, the Federal Reserve would have already cut.  And so you're in a world where it is hard in some sense to even game out what exactly the tariffs are meant to be for. Are they tools for revenue raising. Are they sort of important in order to balance our strategic alignment with vis a vis an adversary like China. Are they really about bringing manufacturing back into the United States.  And the result of that is no one, you, I, and certainly not the business community, has any sense where these tariffs are actually fundamentally gonna land. And that creates a difficulty that we can disagree about what the right effective tariff rate should be in the economy, but certainly this sort of start-stop that makes it impossible really to plan with any sense of where policy is ultimately going to land makes it really challenging to think  as an estimator, certainly very challenging to think about what the likely revenue consequences are going to be. But certainly as a business trying to make investment decisions makes it incredibly complicated to think about that as well."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 368.639, "text": "Natasha, just in our final minute, I want to build off of this because we did see Michigan consumer sentiment for July today come in above estimates.

I don't want to make too much of any one particular data point other than to tell you that the result of our estimates at Yale Budget Lab, which are trying to stay current with respect to where the president says tariffs are going to be come August 1st, this next deadline,  is that consumers are going to see a $2,800 on average decrease in their household income as a result of higher prices.

Netflix beats expectations for second quarter results, but the bar's high and it may not be enough to keep the rally going. Plus, we'll hear from TSMC's CFO on business opportunities, the impact of tariffs, and much more in an exclusive interview. And a look at the expansion plans of defense manufacturing company Hadrian to help build AI-powered factories here in America.  We speak to the CEO. I want to get to some news that broke in the last few minutes. J.P. Morgan, one of the biggest research shops on the street, is expanding its coverage to private companies. And that includes some of the most important tech startups. Open AI.  is where their debut research has launched. So interesting. The analysts on that note saying basically they can't defend the moat that they have on LLMs and in part because of the profit, no profitability till 2029, they're worried about how much patience investors have. Really interesting development when you track the private sector and the world's biggest startups. Let's get to  earnings and Netflix. Netflix shares down significantly right now, 5% in the session. That's the most since the beginning of April as it stands on an intraday basis. But they beat on all of these classic financial metrics. Netflix has been saying for ages, judge us, please, Wall Street, on these financial metrics, and they did great in the second quarter.  boosting their outlook as well. The content slate looks strong and the ad supported share is going to grow doubling in 2025. Let's get out to Blue Boat Lucas Shaw. He's the managing editor for Screen Time. That's our group that basically tracks the culture and our coverage of media entertainment. What was not to like with Netflix right Lucas. This is just like a high bar that's been set by Wall Street and the company did really well.  Yeah, I think you nailed it with the high bar. Look, there was nothing in the results to dislike. It's not like they beat on any metric by some huge amount, but they beat on everything. I think it's a stock that has doubled over the last year. It's a stock that had been up by 40% to 50% so far this year.  Even though it is now the most established and most valuable sort of pure play entertainment company out there, it still has this momentum behind it where people think it has a lot of room to grow. And so by most conventional, you know, P to E ratio metrics, it's overvalued. And so if it only slightly beats, people just aren't as excited. Netflix does this thing where it basically like pre-records its earnings call and then dumps it as a YouTube video. This is what Ted Sarandos had to say on AI.  We remain convinced that AI represents an incredible opportunity to help creators make films and series better, not just cheaper. They're AI-powered creator tools. So this is real people doing real work with better tools. Our creators are already seeing the benefits in production through pre-visualization and shot planning work, and certainly visual effects.  Lucas, I don't know how much attention the street was really paying to that commentary on AI. There was a lot of focus on the content slate, but did we learn anything new about Netflix's strategy going forward? Nothing at a macro high level. Ted has been pretty consistent on his views on AI, which is that it is a tool, it will be used, and it's not just about cost-cutting. They think it can make product better.  But I think what was new was him talking about using it on a show. Most of these Hollywood companies have been very wary of sharing how they're using AI, unless it's in sort of a gimmicky way, like they're going to de-age someone for a movie or show. Nobody gets too worked up about that. But this, along with this Amazon show, House of David, are probably the two highest profile examples, just given how important Netflix and Amazon are to the ecosystem.  Lucas, all over the socials is Stephen Colbert saying that the Late Show is cancelled. Do we know anything? What are the details here? Well, we know that the show is going to end in May of next year, and it's not just Stephen Colbert leaving. The Late Show, which started in I believe 1993, will cease to exist.  So it's the end of an era in late night television. And there will be a lot of speculation as to what happens next to Jimmy Kimmel's show or to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. CBS is really trying to position this as a financial decision. I don't think it would surprise anyone to know that ratings for late night shows have gone down. The cost of doing it hasn't gone up or hasn't gone down either. So the profit made from these types of shows is now very slim. Some might even say they don't make money.  But it's hard not to believe that there is some political angle to this, given what has happened with the Paramount deal and the Trump administration. But nobody has any hard reporting on that. I know that was a jump from Netflix earnings to the Late Show, but it's what everyone's talking about right now online. Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw, who leads the Screen Time team. Thank you very much. I want to stick with Netflix. Dan Kernos, Benchmark senior analyst, joins us now. Benchmark currently has a hold on Netflix.  And what we didn't get into Lucas was the ad supported tear. They're saying that that is in a sort of a revenue contribution terms is going to double in 2025. But did we learn anything more beyond the financials on how the consumer is engaging with that ad supported tear down.  Yeah. Can I actually just go back to something Lucas said for a second. I think that there was some it's to pick with relation to the report. I mean if you wanted to be negative on the stock you would basically say that almost all of the guidance raised came from FX and less from member growth and growth and monetization particularly in that ad supported share that you just mentioned.  And in addition, their engagement grew by only 1%, which, while it's been stable for the last two and a half years, you've had the rest of Hollywood kind of pulling back on content spend. And so why are they not growing their engagement faster as they continue to spend, I think, $16 to $18 billion this year, and then growing that a little bit less than revenue going forward? So that's just one point I'd make. On the ad-supported side, yes, I think we did learn a little bit more last night. We learned that retention remains strong. We learned that ad-supported is  Now more than 50 percent of new sign ups. But we also learn later in the call on the call back that their pricing is improving on ad monetization. And so I do think if you wanted to be more positive on the story you would say OK. So even if most of the guidance raised came from FX they still beat on member growth which we thought would happen going to the print.  And they also improved monetization on the ad-supported, which is going to be the long tail of the growth story. And so numbers for 2026 should also then move slightly higher.  There are gonna be lots of people watching Bloomberg Tech right now saying, hold on, if Netflix was so good, why is the stock down 5%? And of course, as of last night's close, it was a stock that was up 43%, market cap of 500 billion, and that eclipses, you know, your Disney's and your Warner Brothers discoveries by some distance, right? This is a company, would you say, that's in good health?  I think they're in fantastic health. I mean they're the king of the streamers. Right. You can argue YouTube and you can argue YouTube monetization. You can argue how much room Netflix has to run. But by almost all engagement metrics by subscriber metrics they're dominating the streaming industry and they're doing it as opposed to all the rest of the companies that you mentioned. They're doing it profitably and very much so.  If anything else, they actually took up their operating margin guidance this year, and it continues to creep higher. And so maybe that's one of the reasons why they're not splashing out more cash on content spend. They're trying to do it in a thoughtful manner, which we saw others do in maybe a less thoughtful manner. And they're trying to dig out of their holes. So Netflix is in terrific position going forward. But as Lucas said, expectations are very elevated. Dan, what are you watching right now on Netflix? And what are you excited about in the content slate?  Oh, Squid Games 3 looks super exciting. The new animated stuff they've got coming out since we talked about that. Really interesting articles out today about how also kids content is leading sort of the retention charge, so very interested to see what they produce being a family guy here. Really interested to see what they produce downslate, but  You know, there are going to be some unique events, fights in the back half of the year. I look forward to those. And then, of course, you've got the NFL Christmas Day games, and who could miss those, right?  That's a great summary of both the produced and live content. Dan Kernos, Benchmark Capital Senior Analyst. Great to have you on the show. Now, let's get to some news overnight. Meta hired a pair of key AI researchers from Apple, not long after already poaching their former boss from the iPhone maker. Sources say that Mark Lee and Tom Gunter were hired for Meta's Superintelligence Labs team.  and one of them has even started the new job already. It's all part of a scramble for AI talent across the tech industry lately, with Meta proving especially aggressive in its recruiting. That was another Bloomberg exclusive overnight. Now coming up, we're going to have to take a look at how uncertainty over whether President Trump will fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell is impacting technology investors. I also want to get out to shares of crypto-related stocks and take a look at Bitcoin.  This is more about stablecoin, but the Genius Act has gone through the stablecoin legislation. Coinbase is actually office section highs up 4%. Circle's been volatile, but what we know is that this will be sent to the president's desk today and that there'll be a signing ceremony later today. Stick with us. We'll have much more on that. This is Bloomberg Tech.  It's been another wild week in tech, particularly in financial markets, lurching on every twist in a saga around President Donald Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The president says he's not firing Powell, but somehow that statement still felt like a threat. That chaos has very real consequences for policy and for technology investors. Joining us now, Joe Zhao, managing partner at Millenia Capital, and crucially, a former Fed insider and staffer  who worked on markets and monetary policy inside the belly of the beast. Joe, it's great to have you back on Bloomberg Tech. You know what it's like being inside the Fed. You understand the independence of the Fed. But what have you made of this scenario as somebody that's now left the Fed behind and works principally as a private markets investor?  Yeah, look, I think the most direct relationship between Fed policy and technology investing and venture capital investing is the path of interest rates. And in particular, what that means is interest rates have such a huge impact on valuations and returns in the private markets, especially as companies go public. So now, as an entrepreneurial investor running my own firm,  I don't think as much about who's sort of driving the buzzer. Because ultimately, macroeconomics is very much a rules and sort of a principle-based sort of a profession. And whether it's this chair or another chair, the path of interest rates between A and B wouldn't be that much different, just because for a couple of reasons. One is there's also 11 other voting members in the room  And so in my book, rates are coming down. Whether they come down in July or September, the start of the cut, it doesn't really significantly impact private markets valuations. Also, in private markets, there's a lag of many months before asset prices adjust. In the stock market, that might impact post IPO stocks a bit more. But to sum it up, in private markets, we're looking at  often the path of interest rates to put into our financial models and between this chair or another chair, the delta wouldn't be significant.  There's a difference, of course, of being a staffer or working at the Federal Reserve and then being an appointed official at the top of the Federal Reserve. But would you just reflect a little bit on what it was like to work there, research there at the time, and whether you or your colleagues would really pay any attention to the politics of the day?  To be honest, there's not much that the staffers could do. Now, at the board level and the FOMC level, often, the board is very influential, but there's still 11 other, 12 other banks in the room. I think the last thing I'll say on this topic, because I worked there more than 10 years ago, and I was there during the transition from Bernanke to Yellen.  And at that point, you realize whoever was, you know, if you were driving the bus, shouldn't impact monetary policy that much, because ultimately, monetary policy is made on a set of rules, Taylor the Taylor rule, you know, markets and the GDP and inflation.  So that's why as a result, as a staffer, you don't really pay that much attention to the politics. Now, on the private market side, I pay a little bit more attention to the chair because that will impact sort of the path of interest rates. But again, it's not significant to what we do.  We've been using the phrase private markets, but you're also almost all intents and purposes a venture capital investor, right? And the way that it's always explained to me is when you think about the makeup of the LPs, they might be high net worth individuals or family offices. They have a choice. Go with various assets where rates and the current yield on any given treasury is one factor. But they might also say, well, over a 10-year horizon, I want to get 100x on my investment or something like that. Just explain the mechanics of how that factors in.  Yeah. Well, look, as a matter of principle, as an investor, you know, there's, um, sort of average returns you sort of expect. Like if you can always get, uh, two to 5% in money markets on average, cause fed funds is 2% on average, and, and it can go up to 5% like in the last couple of years. And then in terms of, and then you can sort of go into the higher risk assets, like private credit, public credit gain and real estate getting 8, 12%, but then you often go down the risk curve and look for,  and venture capital seeking 20% returns a year. Now, because the risk-free rate is sort of the alternative, the lower the rate, the more risk-seeking the average allocator becomes, and vice versa. So as rates are coming down,  You would expect this all things equal sort of allocator should be allocated more into risk assets. This is sort of the opposite of what happened during QE. The point of QE was to suppress yields, to kind of, you know, force investors to go into risk assets. And so the last couple of years, that kind of went in reverse and now we're kind of going back again.  Joe, we were showing your portfolio earlier, one of the names you're in, Scale AI, or were in, I think. Your reaction and your summary of that meta superintelligence team and the AQUAHIRO scale?  Yeah, we're still a significant investor in the company. So to take a step back, in the last 18 months, we've deployed over nine figures of capital into the AI foundational companies. And some of them are listed. There's others we didn't list on the website for NDA reasons. And scale is one of those investments. And so I've read a lot about what's covered in the press. And my take is,  I still believe in the long-term potential of that business for a few reasons. One is like its business model is more of a SaaS and consulting business model where who's at the helm impacts the company's future a bit less than if this were at a large language model company where the leadership team and the founding team and the engineers were probably would account for the majority of the value. So, you know, scale has many... Right.  large contracts from the government, from corporations, and these are recurring businesses. So after the sort of the transaction, by the way, you know, we've received some... Joe, real quick, we're short on time, but I really wanted to ask you about this. We reported that JPMorgan is moving into research of private companies, starting with OpenAI, that you have exposure to. Just 30 seconds, but you're going to read that research?  Honestly, public market investors tend to less understand private markets a bit more. I heard the show a little bit earlier. In private markets, companies are supposed to be burning cash.

Coming up, we're going to hear from the CFO of TSMC about the chip makers' efforts to expand into the United States. That's coming up next. This is Bloomberg Tech.

They managed to lift their four-year growth forecast, for instance, to 30%. That was up from around 25%. And even when you think about how they performed in the first half of the year, their guidance for the third quarter, it's very strong and it's well above that. So the key question was sort of,  what exactly is going to be happening in your fourth quarter and just how bad could it get as well. But essentially, Wendell Huang, he told me that they are just very concerned about the macro uncertainties that really relates to tariffs, of course. And that also played into the CapEx story, which was another big talking point in the interview, because they've kept that at $38 billion to $42 billion. He said that they're going to be sticking with that again, given those uncertainties, even though he said for a company of that size, you don't expect it to have any sort of big fluctuations year to year.

Taiwan or TSMC, as you said, it is the major company in Taiwan. It's by far the heaviest, waiting on a local benchmark here. But as you said, it's got basically 100% of its revenue in US dollars, around 75% of its costs, its outgoings are in Taiwanese dollars.  and in the past few months there's been a rapid appreciation in the Taiwan dollar. So that's had a really big impact on the company earnings because actually if you had looked at them just in USD figures, the numbers would have been even stronger but it was around a 4.5-5% hit for the period. But in terms of how they're managing this, well asked about sort of the different hedging tools that are available to them.  They said that they do prefer vanilla strategies, but some of the things they're doing that he spoke about included selling Taiwanese dollars or U.S. dollars rather in the spot market. They're injecting money. We've seen them injecting $10 billion, for instance, recently into TSMC Global. So that's a subsidiary. And then they also use forward contracts as well.

This is Bloomberg Tech.  Welcome back to Bloomberg Tech. Netflix is worth recapping right. The stock's down almost 5 percent. That puts it on track for its biggest drop since the first week of April. But it is a stock that was up more than 40 percent so far this year in excess of 500 billion dollars market cap beat across the board strong forecast but a very high bar. And that's kind of a big factor. And the only real stock story that's out there in the market right now though a couple of more to come.  Now, what happens next? Big tech earnings on the docket. Next week, you have Tesla, and then you have Alphabet, and then it just comes thick and fast the week after with Apple, Amazon, and then much later in August, NVIDIA. Earnings in the tech space is back in focus. Thank goodness. What are we expecting? Martin Norton, Chief Investment Strategist at Empower, is with us.  It's my happy time, right?

So, of course, we're focused on tariffs, we're focused on everything that's happening at the Fed, but if we roll the clock back to the start of the year and all the questions that were surfacing around DeepSeek, let alone concerns on where AI demand is, what we've really seen as the year has progressed is that CapEx continuing, and then also these nascent signs of AI demand and AI implementation, which has been such a boon for the hyperscalers in particular.

But what I reflect on is that when NVIDIA hit $4 trillion of market cap, all of the research I was reading was about how the data in the 90 days prior to that had basically shown that NVIDIA's most important customers had that commitment that you just outlined on capital expenditures.  Take that forward into this next period and bear with me. Is it just as simple as you need to see Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta continue to say we're committed to this for NVIDIA then to have a great print when it comes around?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1533.952, "text": " Well, I think that's the first derivative.

But then also that second derivative, which is what I think of as that AI implementation, both within the tech sector, but then for the economy overall.

There has been this massive enthusiasm where the market is beginning to appreciate what's happening with AI and maybe a sigh of relief in terms of the resilience of the economy. But I think when we're taking a look at tariffs, we haven't really seen the full force of those costs come into effect.  And so, of course, we want to see what happens with corporate earnings in Q2. But as I think about longer term and kind of this rollback of globalization, I guess my thought is, you know, longer term, what does this mean for corporate profitability? And, you know, there's revenue that the government is collecting that's coming from corporations.

So when we're taking a look at valuations, what we really want to focus on is the extremes. So, for example, technology, if we're looking at its valuations, price-to-forward earnings over kind of a history for that particular sector, it is in those extremes. It's in those ninth, tenth deciles. But when we're looking at the MAG-7, we don't see that same, I guess, extreme valuation picture. So I think it's really that one-two punch that we saw  for the Mag 7, first getting hit by the deep seat questions, then getting hit on the tariffs that have made those companies a little bit more approachable in valuation.

Great to have you back on the show. Thank you very much. Now coming up, manufacturing company Hadrian announces expansion plans to help build out AI-powered factories here in America. This is the defense use case. We're going to speak to CEO Chris Power next. This is Bloomberg Tech.  Defense manufacturing company Hadrian has announced it's raised a $260 million Series C that will be used to expand its footprint in California and Arizona. The company's building AI and robot automated factories across the US, utilized heavily in the aerospace and defense industries. Chris Powers, Hadrian CEO, joins us now. Chris, welcome to Bloomberg Tech. It's really great to have you on. One of your investors says that the product is the factory.  Just explain that. So we view our job as to reindustrialize the country. And from the 70s to the 2020s we really like offshored everything we possibly could. And it's this whole system of both our software powered by Opus as well as this new American workforce that creates this factory system. And that is the real output to our customers is like what are we producing how accurate is how on time it is. And  this full stack factory autonomy and the new American workforce that we're enabling with that alongside is the most important thing we're building. And that's why we think that the factory system that we're building with the people and technology combined is the product. Sizable round, interesting group of investors, Founders Fund, Andreessen, Lux Capital. Why the size of the round, the difficulty or not in raising it and what you plan to do with it, Chris?  We're very lucky that we were open and shut within a small handful of weeks, less than a month. Really, that's just a credit to the fundraising ability of the market. It's just the team's hard work over the last year. What we will do with this capital is, you know, expand into Arizona with a new factory for our customers that's four times the size, as well as use that capital to hire more people so we can ship more manufacturing capabilities to our customers, both in aerospace and defense sectors, commercial manufacturing, and obviously, you know, the DoD as well.  In January of this year, I was with the Andoril team in Ohio when they announced and confirmed that would be the side of Arsenal 1. And part of the discussion I had with Palmer Luckey was, why not California? Hadrian also has this big footprint in California, but you've looked to Arizona for your expansion. I think that's really worth discussing.  Yeah, we will have R&D in California and we're not moving out of California, but one of the most important things is that we're creating thousands and thousands of new manufacturing jobs in every state. Arizona has been great to work with on the practical stuff like permitting, workforce, getting energy connected to the building, all these basic things that are harder to do in some states. So we're really happy to expand into Arizona, but it also won't be the last. Our goal is to have factories in every state and creating millions of new manufacturing jobs along the way.  Chris, something that I think was kind of missed from your post and the announcement was what you're expanding into, welding, casting, additive. Is that just because that's where the demand is, particularly from the DoD and the defense apparatus of this country?  That's right. I think if you look at you know pretty public information from the secretary of the Navy or the army in areas like shipbuilding the nuclear force munitions there's these huge lack of skills in the country. You know we need millions of welders. We need millions of machinists. We need millions of quality inspectors in all these manufacturing capability areas. And we just don't have the skilled workforce at that volume anymore.  And this is what we're really doing with factories as a service, which is combining technology to make people 10 times more efficient and enabling them. It's not about replacing workforce and manufacturing because we just don't have a manufacturing workforce anymore in this country. So we really need to combine the two things that America is best at, you know, American software and the American spirit to get this 10 times advantage over our global competitors. And yeah, we're working on those categories primarily because they're so important for areas like shipbuilding.  Chris, when your peers come on this program, you know, Castellian, Saronic, Vannevar Labs, or the Anduril team, they frame it in the context of China, China's manufacturing prowess, its competence in areas like software and hardware. How do you think about China, and what is the sort of Hadrian mission statement with regards to China, if indeed you take it into consideration?  Yeah we think that the the arsenal of inventory is not deterrence. It's the ability to produce fast and onshore not just in areas of defense but in pharmaceuticals. And that's why you have to reindustrialize the country. And I agree. You know we've we've given the farm away to the CCP by letting them have all our manufacturing capability over the last three decades. And now we're in a position where that really degraded the skill set of the trades in the U.S.  And this is why building ships, building munitions, building machine components in this country is very difficult because we kind of offshore that talent to the Chinese. I certainly think that the US needs to be the strongest industrial power like we were post-World War II, again, in order to prevent or meet that threat.  Chris, is your ceiling limited just by the idea that your core customer is the DoD? Or in the future, do you do business with these other primes and other startups as well? Very quick. All of our customers are, you know, a defense startup or a space startup from day one up to all the mega primes through that whole chain. The DoD has only been recently a part of our business, but we are working with the vast majority of, you know, hardware startups all the way through to the, you know, mega cap public prime and everything in the middle.  Chris power. Adrian see you're really grateful for your time on Bloomberg Tech. Thank you very much. Now I want to get to a story out of China. China's top venture capital firms are back in the market raising over two billion dollars in new dollar denominated funds. Lightspeed China is targeting 400 million dollars for deep tech.  Monolith, which backs Moonshot AI, plans a second fund worth at least $265 million. At least six major firms are courting overseas investors, signaling renewed global interest in China's startup ecosystem, from AI to consumer tech. OK, coming up, President Trump is set to release new AI guidelines. We're going to have all the details on that next. This is Bloomberg Tech.  President Trump is expected to announce new AI policy guidelines calling for an easing of regulation and an expansion to energy sources for its data centers.

They want to do something that will do more to ensure and speed adoption of this technology, while also still trying to set a few rules of the road. We're expecting the president to deliver remarks on AI  an event at the White House on Wednesday, July 23rd. David Sachs will be here. It's an event that's being put together with the folks from the All In podcast, where David Sachs is one of the co-hosts. And we're also expecting the president to be signing a few executive orders connected with all of that. It's not going to be as far-reaching a statement on the technology itself. This will be focused more on executive branch actions. Yet it still will carry some weight, and we'll be watching it very closely here.  all eyes on Washington next week. I think that's fair to say. I see some breaking news this morning, which is that the House Select Committee on China essentially criticizing or reprimanding the president, allowing chip makers, Nvidia, the focus in being able to resume some limited chip sales back into China. What do we know?  Well, we're hearing from the top Republican on the committee, one of the toughest China hawks in town, really raising questions about this decision to allow NVIDIA to resume sales of the H20 AI chip in China. Remember, the Trump administration had barred sales and shipments of that chip to China over national security concerns just back in April. But in the past week or so, we have seen that  restriction lifted. And that was a huge win for NVIDIA, but it prompted questions from John Molinar, the Michigan Republican who heads this committee focused on the competition with China and the challenge that the world's second largest economy poses to the U.S.  Now, Mueller is raising the concern that, look, if we allow these H-20 chips to be sold once again in China, this will simply allow Beijing to acquire more capabilities in artificial intelligence, including some that could go to fuel its military and intelligence complex.  Bloomberg's Mike Shepard. Thank you very much. Staying in Washington, the U.S. Commerce Department is set to impose preliminary anti-dumping duties of 93.5% on imports of Chinese graphite. That's a key component of battery manufacturing. I want to get out to Evelina Stoicu of Bloomberg NEF. Evelina, you kind of lead our analysis and in-house research of the battery supply chain.

Welcome to Balance of Power on Bloomberg TV and radio. I'm Kaley Lines, alongside Tyler Kendall in Washington, where the conversation has been dominated by controversy surrounding the release of information related  to, of course, the convicted, now late, sex offender, Epstein. President Trump now asking the Department of Justice or authorizing them to ask a court to release some files related to Epstein. The question, of course, is will that be enough to assuage his supporters who want more transparency around this? And, of course, Tyler, it comes after a Wall Street Journal report hit yesterday alleging that President Trump once sent a suggestive birthday letter to Epstein. The president says that letter was fake and is threatening to sue the journal over that story.  Right, and we should say the paper declined to comment on the president's litigation threat. Another big question here is whether or not the federal court would actually grant the administration's request to make public grand jury deliberations, because this is usually a pretty secretive process.  Yeah, and of course, all of this is not what President Trump wants to spend today talking about. He's been pushing back heavily against the idea that this keeps coming up. He's hoping to shift focus, perhaps, just about an hour and a half from now, as he's getting ready to sign into law the Genius Act, a piece of legislation that will regulate stablecoins in the US. There's going to be a big ceremony with all the pomp and circumstance at the White House at 2.30 p.m., and we're actually going to speak with a congressman from the Financial Services Committee who cares very much about  this effort when it comes to crypto regulation. Congressman Bill Huizenga is going to be joining us shortly. Right. This is considered to be a pretty big legislative achievement for the White House. But we also have to keep in mind it was crypto week in Congress and they didn't accomplish everything that they ultimately wanted to.

Thank you so much. On this Friday here in Washington, we're still talking about the very story that President Trump was initially hoping we wouldn't be talking about this entire week, and yet that's how it's played out, as members of his own base of support push for greater transparency around material related to the case of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Of course, President Trump is now asking  the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to move forward in asking a court to authorize the release of some grand jury information. But it comes after a report in the Wall Street Journal last night alleging that President Trump, before he was president, once sent a suggested birthday letter to Epstein for his 50th birthday. The president has called that story false, malicious, and defamatory. And as we've mentioned, Tyler, is threatening to sue the Wall Street Journal, its parent company, and in fact, Rupert Murdoch over it.  Right, exactly. And the paper did decline to reply to the litigation threat. But we really have started to see some of his supporters perhaps get behind this idea of fake news and attacking the media over this report. But there are still a lot of people out there that want to see some more information released and get some of these questions answered, which is where we start now with Bloomberg senior White House reporter Josh Wingrove, who's joining us here in our DC studio. Josh, can you just  put into context for us, because it doesn't seem like this issue is going away for President Trump.

But the story  maybe is a double-edged sword, right? Because right now, the White House is trying to seize it as a rallying cry. Look, fake news, you know, the president is being pursued again by, you know, the media and trying to sort of, you know, steer attention that way. But so far, it hasn't worked. I mean, Trump has tried a lot of things to steer attention away from this. It just hasn't been successful. And, you know, you have allies like Charlie Kirk and others who are saying that this case is sort of like part and parcel with all  his base's concerns about the deep state and these, you know, hidden theories and whatever, including, we should probably call them conspiracies at some end of the flank. But that is why they're so upset. They thought that they would get clarity from Trump on this. It's not coming out. So it's less that they are worried that he himself might be involved in it, which of course is the sort of  question raised by this journal story, just how close was Donald Trump with Jeffrey Epstein. But more the broad question is they felt that essentially that they were sold the bill of goods and they, you know.  want those goods, and they're not getting them so far. So we'll see right now. It's unclear. Remember, of course, there's been questions about Pam Bondi's future. Trump has really stood by her. I find it personally difficult to see how he would do anything but that, because it just doesn't make sense that she'd be acting solo here. I mean, she's in lockstep with the president on this. So we don't know where it will go, but this has divided the mega base in a way that we have not seen at all, anything close to this.  in the second term.

And, you know, we'll see if it shows up in these poll numbers. But yeah, they're on a winning streak right now. They want to talk about these things.  And once these bills sort of get through, and they clear the decks on a couple of other things, I think then one question to watch for is, will we get any more Tom Tillises? Will we get anyone that has been a team player until now, but maybe now starts to come forward with stuff that they're not jazzed about, as Senator Tillis has. Of course, he's not seeking re-election, so the threat of a primary challenge is going away. So we'll see.

And as we consider that crypto bill, especially in the moment it marks for an industry that has been lobbying hard here in Washington for years now for something like this to materialize, Tyler, it's also worth pointing out that they have a lot of money powering them too. And they are a force  as we look ahead to the midterms in 2026, they're likely to be spending money like we saw in 2024. Exactly. And we've already seen figures from fair shake, for example, one of the super packs and its affiliated packs that has an enormous amount of cash on hand already, because even though it feels like we already just got through an election here in Washington, we're already preparing for 2026. And when you do look at how slim the majorities are in both chambers, this is a political faction  a pile of money that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are going to try to capitalize on. Well, yeah, that's absolutely true. And perhaps that's why lawmakers are putting more focus on actually getting this legislation across, despite what at least some Democrats have suggested are ethics concerns around the way in which legislation like this could actually serve to benefit President Trump and his wider family. Those ethics questions, I'm sure, will have to wait for another day. I wouldn't imagine President Trump is going to address them.  at the signing ceremony later on today. But we want to talk more about this legislation with a member now of the House Financial Services Committee, who is here with us in our Washington, D.C. studio on this Friday, Republican Congressman Bill Huizenga, representing Michigan's 4th District.

Good to be with you."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 665.188, "text": "Yeah."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 665.509, "text": "As well. It's been a big week in your chamber. It's going to be a big day. Yeah.  This week has been a hell of a month, I tell you. Yeah, maybe it should have been reframed as Crypto Marathon rather than Crypto Week. It was something else. But, you know, look, a lot of us have been involved in this for a very long time. And I understand that this might be hitting some of our colleagues a little fresher than certainly what those of us who have been diving into this for a number of years have been having to wrestle with.  You know, this is an important, I think, an important statement for us with the Genius Act. Was it my first choice? No. The House was my first choice, the House version of that, but very satisfied with where we ended up on Genius.  And, you know, my family's involved in construction back in Michigan, and we build houses. And the first thing you do is you pour the walls and the footings. You know, that's the foundation, literally. And then you go from there. And I think that's what we're going to be working on next. Well, to build off of this, we're talking about the Genius Act. Pun intended on the build up.  Well, you're talking about the Genius Act and perhaps some of the changes that you didn't want to see made. But let's talk also about the Clarity Act, because now that heads to the Senate. What's your message to colleagues in that chamber when it comes to keeping that legislation perhaps as it is? Yeah, well, we think it's a good product.  We certainly wouldn't have put it forward if we didn't. And again, a lot of time and effort has been put into this. And I get it. There's a lot of folks that are getting educated at a level that they maybe necessarily hadn't been at previously. And I'm not saying that about Senate banking or anything like that. I'm talking about general colleagues that have to then go out and vote for these things.  But we think it's a very good, solid product that Chairman Hill and Stile and a number of us and others, Barr, that have been working on this. Warren Davidson, these are folks that have been really doing the heavy lifting over a number of years. And then obviously over on the Senate side, we have colleagues that have done that as well.  So hopefully we're going to be able to come together. I hope that they lightly edit the house version of that. But yeah, it is essential, though, that we not stop. And it's key that we keep moving forward with this, because we have to add the infrastructure, the plumbing on all of this.  Well, and of course, the Clarity Act is supposed to divvy up authority between the SEC and the CFTC. And the new SEC chair, Paul Atkins, actually joined our colleagues on Bloomberg surveillance earlier today talking about how he's viewing this specifically. This is what he said.  We are out to obviously change direction at the SEC, and I think we've already done that. We're moving away from regulation through enforcement and uncertainty in the markets, especially with respect to cryptocurrencies and digital assets in general. And we're looking to set firm, clear rules of the road for people who are operating in that environment.  I wonder about the sense of urgency here, knowing that the SEC now is far less adversarial, shall we say, to this industry. Is there as much urgency in trying to make sure that the CFTC gets more authority over these assets? Well, look, you got to go back and look at what had happened previously under Gary Gensler, right? And of course, when he was head of the CFTC, everything was a commodity. And when he became head of the SEC, everything magically became a security.  And the simple truth is that these things are not either fish or fowl. I always say it's a platypus. It's got characteristics of both in many ways. And it's up to Paul Atkins as well as the legislation that we're passing to compel them to come up with what those rules of the road are. And what we saw in the last administration was basically Chair Gensler just making it up as he was going along.  And that's not acceptable because it doesn't give predictability. It doesn't give surety of a direction. And I've got great confidence in Paul Atkins and what he's going to be doing on that. But again, we can't just sit back and say, OK, we declare victory. We don't have to do anything more. This is really just that first step.  I want to drill down a little bit on the bill that we're seeing signed into law today. When it comes to the Genius Act, stable coins, we have this great story out on the terminal today from actually our colleagues at Bloomberg government that says that everyone's going to rush to register. But the thing is, when it comes to the OCC, the comptroller of the currency where everyone's going to be going, they're facing actually a shrinking workforce. There are doge cuts that have hit the agency.  Do you think that there is bandwidth among our regulators to meet what is expected to be this surge in demand? Yeah, in general, I do. I think that the regulators have to make sure they are prioritizing what their actions are as well. That would be the argument many of us have had over the last four years. We wandered far afield from where those regulators  should be. And they were into whether it was ESG and all kinds of other things that were not necessarily about materiality. They weren't necessarily about safety and soundness and consumer protection. And so, again, I think if they focus in, we're going to be fine on them being able to do that. Is there going to be this bump coming in? Of course. I mean, there's a lot of pent-up demand. And frankly, not many people bought the idea  Just come in and register over the last four years, and all will be fine. I mean, they didn't buy that. So there's a lot of people that were holding back, waiting for this moment so that we could get that clarity. And look, this is good for the US dollar. It's good for our preeminence in the world. It adds to the safety and soundness of not just our currency and our money, but for those that are doing the investing.  It makes it, you know, not frictionless, but less friction in transactions. So I think this is going to be good for the economy as well.  Well, when we consider the safety and soundness and the credibility of the U.S. economy, monetary policy and its credibility also plays a role there. And I ask you this as the vice chair of the House Financial Services Committee. It's one thing for President Trump to suggest he'd like to see lower interest rates. It's another for administration officials to actively be pushing for the chair of the Federal Reserve to resign, suggesting he should be investigated for fraud. Do you see risk here of doing what could be permanent damage to the Fed's independence and therefore credibility by extension?  I believe in an independent Fed that is important now, as Chair Hill yesterday, when he was asked about this in a press conference, started going... None of you can avoid a candle. But he started going through the litany of what was going on with LBJ and with Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and others, Jimmy Carter. I mean, there's been plenty of pressure that has been a  applied to the Fed and Fed chairs and Fed officials over the decades. And because they are independent doesn't mean that they are somehow absent of any criticism or absent of any critique. And I think, as we've seen, a few folks sort of breathlessly say, the Fed chair is going to get fired. The president is going to do this. He himself addressed that, walked that back.  to add clarity to make sure that that wasn't happening. And look, his term is going to be up soon. That's going to be the opportunity, in my mind, where the president's going to be able to really assert himself. Now, does it mean that he needs to do a better job? Yes.  All right, we'll leave it there. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. The Vice Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, Congressman representing Michigan's 4th District, Bill Huizenga, here with us in studio on Balance of Power, live from Washington, D.C. I'm Kayleigh Lines, alongside Tyler Kendall, and we'll have more straight ahead here on this Friday edition, so stick with us on Bloomberg TV and radio.  and  convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with questions not just about the case itself and whether or not there is a client list that officials within the Trump administration had previously suggested did exist, but also into the president's relationship with Epstein, as The Wall Street Journal published a report alleging that President Trump sent a suggestive letter to Epstein for his 50th birthday, a report that the president denies is called defamatory and has threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal over.  But he's also pointing a finger today, Tyler, at Democrats, or I guess, yeah, this is today, earlier this morning on True Social, saying, if there was a smoking gun on Epstein, why didn't the Dems, who controlled the files for four years and had Garland and Comey in charge, use it? He ends it, all caps.  because they had nothing. Right. This is part of the White House's defense here, since this story really does seem to have that sticking power. We're now seeing a movement in Congress even to force a formal vote on releasing these files, as it really does appear to have this grip on really both sides of the party here. And that's perhaps becoming a political liability for the president. And that's where we want to start today by bringing in our political panel. It includes Rick Davis, partner at Stonecourt Capital and a Bloomberg  contributor, and Christina Greer, associate chair at the Department of Political Science at Fordham. Rick, I want to start with you, because where do we go from here? We have President Trump granting this authorization, but it's unclear if a federal court would even grant the administration's request. Could that potentially throw a wrench in the administration's plan, since they appear to be wanting to give those that are seeking more information something to chew on?  Yeah, I almost think that that's what the White House wants, right, is so that they can wake up and then start attacking the judiciary again, saying, oh, well, I wanted you to have this information, but the courts won't let you have it. Of course, I don't think it was a coincidence that they went after the most sensitive.  information you can have, which is grand jury testimony, which is supposed to remain secret. Forget the files you already have at the FBI and in the Justice Department that can be released tomorrow. So look, Biden didn't release this stuff for some reason, and Trump doesn't want to release this stuff for some reason.  My guess is there may be not much to it all and that the only reason the president has actually bowed to this effort is by his own claim is because the publicity was bad for him. And so all he's done is kept the publicity going into this weekend. So we'll have a nice thorough Sunday show spectacular with more Jeffrey Epstein, you know, and who knows? Now everybody's got an investigative journalist looking for more Epstein.  material like the Wall Street Journal came up with. I mean, it is a classic summer scandal. Indeed, and we are in mid-July. As we consider, though, Christina, the sentiment around this, obviously there are loud voices that have always been loud voices within the MAGA base who have made a very big deal about this, thinking of the likes of Laura Loomer. But there's another question of the broader Republican electorate. We've gotten a few polls this week, one from Quinnipiac that shows there is some division  among Republicans on this issue. 40% say they approve of the way the administration is handling the Epstein files. 36% disapprove. 24% did not give an opinion. There were similar divisions in a Reuters-Ipsos poll. 35% approve of the handling. 29% disapprove. Is the fracturing of the Republican, or more specifically, the president's base, a real tangible thing here?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1373.858, "text": " Well, it appears that this is the first time we've seen real fissures within the base. I mean, this is also a base that's been fed a consistent diet of conspiracy theories that the president has sort of promoted and then walked away from. We can start with the birther conspiracy theory. And then when Obama acquiesces and shows his birth certificate, where he is indeed American, the president says, well, that must be a hoax and it must be fake.  right? The Pizzagate scandal with the Clintons and Hillary Clinton in the basement and pedophilia. He's also fed them a consistent diet of, you know, Democrats are somehow attached to pedophiles. The difference is Jeffrey Epstein, this isn't a conspiracy theory. He was convicted for being inappropriate with minors. And so now that he has fed this base for many, many years, certain narratives, he wants to walk away and they're not willing to walk away. And so I think what's  What's been interesting about this particular story for a lot of journalists on both sides of the aisle is that we have not seen the base sort of disavow something that the president has said. They have moved and shifted and twisted themselves into pretzels on a dime as the president changes his whims. In this particular instance, we have a significant portion of his base who are saying, actually, I don't agree with you. I want to get to the bottom of this, whatever  It is, and so it seems as though the president can't shake it. We know, obviously, the administration would like to shake it, considering they're releasing health information, which they never do, about the president as a distraction, and it hasn't distracted his base. And so we will see whether or not it's the courts, whether or not it's Congress, whether or not he can sort of keep pushing this off on Biden and Obama and the Democrats. But at some point in time, his base, a significant portion, wants some information, and he'll have to give them something."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1472.543, "text": " Well, this really has become a top issue here in Washington, but also nationwide.

The reality is that.  that this was really sort of a Trump-instigated problem, right? And sure, there's a lot here that is disturbing to people. Court cases were tried. People were convicted. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself.  And the only people who continued to talk about this wasn't necessarily the Democratic Party. It was the Republicans who said, oh, my God, they're keeping these files secret for a reason. You know, there are all kinds of people. They implied Bill Clinton and others had exposure to this. And it was one of the classic MAGA kind of influenced.  I'm  himself has indicated a willingness to show people something that they hadn't seen before on it. It wasn't really that big an issue until, you know, Pam Bondi said, I'm going to release these records and then didn't release anything that wasn't already in the public domain. So they are tripping over themselves on this issue. And the reality is, I think, when you look at sort of good crisis management,  You tell everybody, everyone be quiet. We're going to speak with one single voice. It will be someone who is not the president of the United States. And we'll draw attention to only that person and only the messages that they give and tell everyone else to be quiet.

Now, that is unacceptable to most taxpayers.  Well, we're also maybe wondering about Bongino's future. We're also wondering about Eric Adams, who we just heard from's future, whether or not he can end up being re-elected mayor of New York City. I would point out, Christina, that on Oddlots with Joe Eisenthal and Tracy Alloway, they talked about a lot more than just Epstein. That full conversation can be found on Spotify, Apple, wherever you get your podcasts. But they, no surprise, talked about the mayoral race. And specifically, Adams had some choice criticism for Zoha Mamdani, who, of course, is the Democratic nominee, specifically his attitude when it comes  to billionaires. You're up at Fordham. You know New York politics well, knowing Mamdani is set to meet with the House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, in New York today.

So first things first, Rick, you know, as a native New Yorker, I would say that we are very welcoming to aliens and not tourists from other places. So just put that out there. But Donald Mundani, you know, going into the general election, we have to remember it's not ranked choice voting the way we saw in the Democratic primary.  He's going up against not just current mayor Eric Adams, three-term governor Andrew Cuomo, the Republican nominee, and also another prominent lawyer, independent nominee, Jim Walden. So there are five people currently in the race to say nothing of all the small names that are always on a ballot. This 33-year-old state legislator has to sort of capture the attention. I talk about this every week on my podcast, FAQ, which is the real estate community  the business community, the labor community, and the Hasidic community. Those are the four communities that can make or break a mayor's chances of getting across the finish line. And it is first past the post. It is not a 50 percent majority that is needed. It is whoever gets the most votes becomes the 111th mayor of New York City. And so Mamdani, who's relatively unknown to the business community, he's relatively unknown to the labor community, which is incredibly diverse.  He's definitely unknown to the real estate community and also to the Hasidic community. And there are lots of conversations that he's had about Israel and domestic versus international policy that he's attempting to clarify and sort of provide more nuance. So this is a summer where he's a fantastic campaigner, but we know that campaigning is not governance. And so part of what he's trying to do is to convince a large portion of New Yorkers that he actually can govern. We've had abysmal turnout over the past few elections.  where we are electing mayors with barely 25 percent, I think we will see a high turnout election just because we have Republicans who may go with the Republican nominee, Curtis Lewa, or they may be more inclined to go with someone like Eric Adams or even an Andrew Cuomo because they think that those individuals can negotiate with Donald Trump in a better fashion."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1832.96, "text": " All right, Christina Greer and Rick Davis, our political panel on this Friday edition of Balance of Power from the New York mayoral race to Epstein.

A week, of course, that has been dominated by many of the headlines we've discussed so far here on balance of power, from what's happened legislatively in Congress to what's going on with the Jeffrey Epstein case and how that's engulfing the Trump administration. But also, of course, the ongoing saga of President Trump and his relationship to the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and whether or not Chairman Powell is going to be safe in his job for much longer. Of course, the president suggests he does not intend at this time to fire Chairman Powell, but that is not stopping him from pressuring Powell  to lower interest rates. Seems we see this every day now on True Social, including a post this morning. Too late, his nickname for Chairman Powell, and the Fed are choking out the housing market with their high rate, making it difficult for people, especially the young, to buy a house. He goes on to say, Tyler, that the US  is rocking, there is very low inflation, and we deserve to be, he says, at 1%. Of course, that is far below where the Fed funds rate currently is. Right. And we actually had asked Joe LaVornia, counselor to Secretary Besant yesterday about this. Perhaps we'll have to see where they actually end up.  thinking that the Fed funds rate should shake out. But it is apparent that the administration feels bolstered by what has been positive economic data, retail sales yesterday, University of Michigan consumer sentiment today. All, of course, factors when we are talking about this pressure campaign from the White House. And actually, our colleagues earlier today on Bloomberg Television sat down with the Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. You heard Charlie mention it earlier on surveillance. He is, of course, seen as a potential replacement for  Jerome Powell, and he hinted himself that he would dissent if his colleagues end up holding rates steady in their July meeting.

Workers may eat some of that cost in terms of less hiring and things like that. The firm will take it out of their profit margins.  And then lastly, some of it will get passed on.

If it's still just a question of delaying it, that doesn't change my argument.

But of course, President Trump does not want the Fed to be on hold, as we mentioned once again today, pushing the Fed to lower interest rates. He believes the Fed should be down at 1 percent. That would be substantial cuts from where we are now. And we want to get into this and other issues as we turn now to Natasha Surin. She's professor at the Yale Budget Lab, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy  and former counselor to the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen at the Treasury Department. Natasha, welcome back to Bloomberg TV and radio. When we consider the president, who in that true social post, as he pushed for a 1% Fed funds rate, talked about how that rate would save the US a trillion dollars a year in terms of the interest payments that we have to make. Is that really how it will work in reality? If that is the narrative he is pushing, the Fed cuts rates, it makes our financial situation fiscally as a nation much easier?  So the challenge that we kind of have to grapple with is that the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve's independence is really crucial to the role that it's able to play in the economy as a stabilizer. So when the Federal Reserve makes decisions it has two things in mind. It has what is the employment picture look like and what is inflation look like. And it's react  to those two particular really substantive data questions. If you're in a universe where instead a Federal Reserve that's become politicized is reacting to what President Trump thinks that the interest rates should be, well, in that situation, you kind of break the relationship between what the Federal Reserve actually gets to set, which is the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend to one another,  and things like mortgage rates or car loan rates or small business loan rates that are actually relevant to consumers in this economy. So perversely by sort of trying to push so aggressively for an interest rate that is way outside of the realm of what any economic observers think makes sense in an  environment where employment is basically at 4 ish percent and inflation is still not back to target and in fact taking upward because of this tariff policy. You really don't have any case to make for those type of rate choices outside of just politicization of the Federal Reserve which comes with real risks.  I'm also hoping, Natasha, that you can give us a little bit more context here, too, because we have to keep in mind that the Fed chair is only one vote on the Federal Open Market Committee. And we did speak to Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who told us earlier this week on Balanced Power that they are seeking for Powell to step down as chair, but also his position on the board.  Can you just give us a little bit could this complicate the administration's ultimate goal here when you do have other members who are voting and what we are hearing from those other members when it does come to the future of rate cuts? And you know it's like really important for your viewers I think and listeners to understand like there is no sort of button that the Fed chair pushes to change the interest rate.  The way that it works, as you're describing, is the Federal Reserve chair is one of 12 members on the Federal Open Markets Committee that makes decisions. They meet eight times a year. They make decisions on the trajectory of the interest rate. And importantly, these are decisions that are made by a group of people. And so the Fed chair, even if the president was effective at getting a Fed chair in who was going to push for his desired rate cuts that he's sort of trying to effectuate from the top in ways that break Federal Reserve independence,  Well, the rest of the board is going to be in a situation, and the rest of the committee is going to be in a situation where they're actually trying to push against exactly that impulse because they want to preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve, both because they are sort of institutionally very concerned about it, but also because only then can we be in a situation where we are actually trusted and credible as being reactive to inflation and being reactive to the employment picture.  And what's important for your viewers, listeners also to understand is like we in some sense have run this experiment before. Like President Nixon put a ton of pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut rates in ways that would be short term politically expedient. They did. And as a result of that, you saw inflation take up from three percent to 13 percent over the course of two years in ways that required a massive course correction and led to a significant downturn. So like I  I don't think anyone should be rooting for that in this country. And it certainly goes against what the Trump administration is hoping to see from an economic perspective. Yeah, the historical context is important to keep in mind here, Natasha. And I appreciate you pointing that out. As you talk about the idea of trust and credibility for the Federal Reserve, I also wonder about the trust and credibility of the president as we consider his very frequently changing deadlines when it comes to tariff  and trade policy, because this is what the Fed is having to contend with, why it makes their decision-making perhaps so hard. How do you at Budget Lab even try to game out the tariffs and the likely revenue we are going to be getting from them when the deadlines keep moving and the numbers keep changing? Is it even really possible to model  I mean, we are doing our best. My colleagues and I at the Budget Lab are sort of tracing every single twist and turn with respect to tariff policy in this country. And, you know, to our count, we've seen the effect of tariff rate change like almost 60 times over the course of the last several months as a result of the president's different political policies that have been pursued in this trade war.  The thing that I think is really important to grapple with, and you heard actually Governor Waller say a version of this. You've heard Chair Powell say a version of this as well. The president's been super specific. He would like to see interest rates lower. Chair Powell and the rest of the Fed have been pretty specific as well that in a world in which this sort of uncertainty associated with trade policy didn't exist, the Federal Reserve would have already cut.  And so you're in a world where it is hard in some sense to even game out what exactly the tariffs are meant to be for. Are they tools for revenue raising? Are they sort of important in order to balance our strategic alignment with vis-a-vis an adversary like China? Are they really about bringing manufacturing back into the United States? And the result of that is no one, you, I, and certainly not the business community, has any sense where these tariffs are actually  fundamentally going to land. And that creates a difficulty that we can disagree about what the right effective tariff rate should be in the economy. But certainly this sort of start stop that makes it impossible really to plan with any sense of where policy is ultimately going to land makes it really challenging to think  as an estimator, certainly very challenging to think about what the likely revenue consequences are going to be. But certainly as a business trying to make investment decisions makes it incredibly complicated to think about that as well. Natasha, just in our final minute, I want to build off of this because we did see Michigan consumer sentiment for July today come in above estimates. What are we learning when there is uncertainty, though, about the consumer's tolerance here, since confidence at one point was plunging amid tariff concerns, but today's data did show it at a five-month high?  You know, I think it's really hard to make any too much out of any one particular data point. We also got data this week about inflation that showed that in certain particular industries, if you look at things like consumer electronics or if you look at things like household furnishings, which is a category that includes furniture,  industries or sub industries where the tariffs are likely to have substantial bite, you're starting to see an uptick in prices. I don't want to make too much of any one particular data point other than to tell you that the result of our estimates at Yale Budget Lab, which are trying to stay current with respect to where the president says tariffs are going to be come August 1st, this next deadline, is that consumers are going to see a $2,800  on average decrease in their household income as a result of higher prices. And for the bottom of the distribution, that's on top of something that you all have been talking a great deal about, which is these important cuts to social programs like Medicaid that have been recently effectuated. So I think there's a lot here that's pretty important. Natasha, we have to leave it there. Natasha Surin of Yale Budget Lab here with us on Balance of Power. Thank you for joining us. We'll be back for more at 5 p.m. right here on Bloomberg TV and radio."}], "keywords": ["Executive Order", "Tariffs", "Trade", "China"], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Aaron McLaughlin": null, "Adrian Broadus": null, "Al Roker": null, "Alan Greenspan": null, "Albert Bourla": null, "Alexander Bolton": null, "Alice Barr": null, "Amanda Mull": null, "Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Andy_Harris": null, "Angie Lassman": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Anne-Marie Hordern": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Ben Bernanke": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill Ferries": null, "Bill Pulte": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brian_Moynihan": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caleb Silver": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Camila Bernal": null, "Camila Brunel": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Dan Whitehead": null, "David Gurra": null, "David Weston": null, "Department for Education Spokesperson": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elizabeth Warren": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Geetha Ranganathan": null, "George Solis": null, "George Solis, NBC News": null, "Greg Gutfeld": null, "Hallie Jackson": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "House Speaker": null, "House Speaker Mike Johnson": null, "Howard": null, "Ian King": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jay Powell": null, "Jay_Powell": null, "Jensen Wang": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "Joel Wertheimer": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "John_Molinar": null, "Johnny Appleyard": null, "Jordan Fabian": null, "Josh Hawley": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Julie Sorkin": null, "Julien_Pontus": null, "Karen Bass": null, "Karen Moskow": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Kate Snow": null, "Katie Hubbard": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Keir Simmons": null, "Kelly O'Donnell": null, "Ken Langone": null, "Kennedy": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kevin Warsh": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Kyle Schwarber": null, "Lara Trump": null, "Larry Kudlow": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Laura_Trump": null, "Lawrence_Jones": null, "Leslie Picker": null, "Lisa Murkowski": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Mayor Thompson": null, "Megan Kinsella": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Michael McKee": null, "Michael Rappaport": null, "Mike Johnson": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Nancy Reagan": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nathan Hager": null, "Nicholas Burns": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Pam Bondi": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Paul Volcker": null, "Pete Alonso": null, "Phil Murphy": null, "Priscilla Azevedo-Rocca": null, "Priya Sridhar": null, "Rob Parker": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Russell Vought": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": null, "SPEAKER_01": null, "SPEAKER_02": null, "SPEAKER_03": null, "SPEAKER_04": null, "SPEAKER_04 (Trump)": null, "SPEAKER_05": null, "SPEAKER_06": null, "SPEAKER_07": null, "Sam Brock": null, "Sam Schweppe": null, "Sauce Gardner": null, "Scarlett Fu": null, "Scott Bieser": null, "Scottie Scheffler": null, "Secretary of State Marco Rubio": null, "Selena Zito": null, "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Senator Chuck Grassley": null, "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer": null, "Senator Patty Murray": null, "Senator Susan Collins": null, "Shanali Basik": null, "Stan Druckenmiller": null, "Stephen A.

Please send your questions to us in writing or as a voice memo to zeropod at bloomberg.net, and we'll make an episode answering them. Please do include your name and where you're based. Thank you. Welcome to Zero. I'm Akshat Rati. This week, one big beautiful climate mess.  On July 3rd, the U.S. Congress passed President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, a huge package of economic and tax legislation that's meant to reorganize American society. The bill gave tax breaks to corporations and to the richest Americans, while cutting into budgets for medical programs, food aid, and most importantly for this show, clean energy spending.  The U.S. Office of Budget Responsibility estimates that the bill, which we'll call O-triple-B, will cut $488 billion in clean energy spending over the next 10 years. And that's only the government spending part.  The $488 billion was supposed to be matched many times over by private investment, which may not happen now as a result. It is a dire prognosis for the US, which only just started to take its climate goals seriously. So, has the US given up on green tech? Jigar Shah doesn't think so."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 101.787, "text": " The moment that we're in is the exact same moment that the fracking industry was in in 2014 when the Saudi Arabians decided to declare war against the fracking industry in the United States.

But I think at the time, all of the stock analysts and all of the big newspapers were saying the fracking industry was dead."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 125.902, "text": " Jigar Shah spent the last two decades in the clean energy industry in the US, and most recently, he was the head of the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office.

So I got to ask him, what does the passing of the OEEB mean for the U.S. 's climate goals, whether U.S. climate innovation is now dead in the water, and what does the bill's passing mean for U.S.-China clean tech competition? Welcome back to the show, Jigar."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 162.655, "text": " It's great to be back. It's always interesting times that we live in."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 167.601, "text": "Well, let's start with the headline because President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill has now become an act. And according to the Office of Budget Responsibility, it means $488 billion worth of clean energy spending that's gone. Much of it was linked to President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. And of course, you served under the Biden administration.  So let's look at the big picture first and we'll come to the nitty-gritty later. Biden set out a goal that the U.S. will cut its emissions in half by the end of the decade relative to 2005 levels. Do you think the OBBB has killed any hope that the U.S. will meet those goals?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 208.163, "text": "I think that the people who voted for the OBBB  believe that they intended to kill those goals. I think that we've seen this before, right? So I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I mean, this is obviously a huge setback for our industry, right? And you would say that this is the first time that a sitting president has gone to war with clean energy.  But I think at the same time, when you think about where our industry was in 2017, when Trump first came into office, it was quite nascent, right? I mean, solar panels were not necessarily fully bankable, like battery storage was a gleam in people's eye. Today, I would suggest that, you know, we are now in a place where Pakistan is deploying, you know, 12 gigawatts of solar a year.  Right? And you see many other countries doing the same thing around the world. I think you've got, you know, folks who are installing balcony solar at record levels in Germany, right? Battery storage has clearly saved the Texas grid every single day. And as a result, like the O triple B has not touched battery storage. And so I would suggest to you that one,  the industry has to recognize that it has now gotten targeted. And so it needs to invest the money required to actually defend itself, right? So today the clean energy industry in the United States invests double the amount of CapEx that the oil and gas industry does each year. And that's a big number because remember the US is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world. So I'm not,  referring to a small industry, but we're double the amount of CapEx every year that the oil and gas industry do. And we spend one twentieth of the amount of money on influence and political power. And so as a result, we have very little of it. And so I think for a long time, people thought, but we're cute and furry and beautiful to hold like no one hates clean energy. Well,  there are people who actually hate clean energy. And so I think we all need to acknowledge the humbling nature of what's happened here and recognize that this is all solvable, that we can build political power. We provide a huge amount of local benefits. And I would say this is the first time in  my lifetime that so many elected officials deliberately tried to sabotage their own constituents in service to a party leader. So we'll see how durable this war against clean energy really is."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 356.11, "text": " So I spoke to one analyst and he basically put it in the simplest way. He said, the clean energy part of this bill is more about cultural issues than economic ones. At a time, as you noted, rest of the world is doubling down on clean energy. This bill will pull the US back from investing in it. His read was that the US is actually acting like a petrostate, not a country that wants to dominate on energy. Is that a fair read?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 382.874, "text": " You know, I find that people have a lot of these hot takes. And I think it's important to start with just saying what I did before, which is that we were targeted as an industry and as a result, and we were unprepared for that targeting. And so we lost. That being said,  We have an affordability crisis in the United States. What this bill has done is stripped 17 million people of Medicaid. If you look at the way the president has operated our economy, we started his administration with a 2% average tariff on all incoming goods in the United States. Today, our average tariff is 15%.  And with all the announcements happening as we speak, that number might be 25%. That is generally on the back of poor people, right? And so that means a bunch of people are going to spend an extra $1,800, $5,000 per year on stuff, depending on what they're buying. And so you could imagine how quickly this will change within  a year, that if a year from now people's electricity bills are up 9% because of all these bad decisions, you could imagine them reversing them very quickly after the midterm elections, right? And so I want to make sure that people recognize this for what it is, which is a stunning defeat of the clean energy industry and a wake up call to the fact that  Yes, we have extraordinary solutions and they are by far the easiest way to reach energy dominance and to reach affordability for consumers. But we did not do the work.  to make sure that everyone understood that."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs", "Export", "Import", "Apple", "iPhone"], "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 475.377, "text": "So let's get into the details, and I'll just list a few things because they're worthy of noting. We know that EV tax credits that would take enough $7,500 off the sticker price of a car, those are going away later this year. A whole bunch of incentives that would have made it cheaper for people to electrify their home, put rooftop solar, those are going away. But there are some tax credits  for clean energy that have been protected. So when you look at the bill, is there any good news for climate tech in there?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 506.973, "text": "Yeah, so let's be very specific about what's in the bill because I think that people get very confused. We are going to have a boom in residential solar this year as people try to install solar before the 25D tax credit expires at the end of the year, right? So everybody I know of that I've talked to is fully sold out through the end of the year, right? They're working as hard as they can.  For the large scale projects, or this is commercial and utility scale projects, all of the companies who've already started construction of projects will be given the ability to finish them within 2027 without any additional foreign entities of concern, language, any of the other poison pills don't apply if the project's already under construction.  And so that takes us all the way through 2027. Right. So I just want to make sure that we're crystal clear that like solar and wind are going to have bumper years this year, next year, probably in 2027 as well. Then there's a drop off. And so this is, you know, what you call a cold water approach to phasing out subsidies. Right.  Now you've got a lot of less mature sectors that have been given much more runway and batteries are included in that. So I think that's a good news story. And the vast majority of the battery developers are all solar and wind developers. Those divisions of their companies will grow while the other divisions of their companies might go slightly flat.  Then you've got a huge pusher on nuclear, which I think has largely been started by the Biden administration. And I think that currently the Trump administration is sort of just using the work that we did. I don't think they've actually done their own work yet, but I'm hopeful that they will. They've promised to streamline regulations and make it easier to do stuff. But when I talk to investors, their spreadsheets haven't resulted in any reductions in costs in the spreadsheet. So we'll see whether  that comes through. I think enhanced geothermal is on its way. I think that was already on its way with the geothermal liftoff report that we wrote and all the other things that we've done. I think the oil and gas industry are very interested in investing in that space. I would suggest that they're actually not being ambitious enough in the enhanced geothermal space on the private sector side. I think that this administration desperately wants to help them more and they're not being more vocal about how they might be able to receive or utilize that help, right? So I think there's,  some communication challenges there. There was a huge amount of additional resources provided to hydropower. We have 37,000 megawatts of old hydro that is going to be retired over the next five to eight years, right? So relicensing all that hydro, putting in next generation technology could get 50% more power output out of all of those existing sites, right? So it's a huge source of clean firm power that could come forward. There was a extension of the fuel cell tax credits, which I'm not quite sure is amazing, but it's great.  There's some good stuff in there, right? And around the commercialization of technology. But I do think that the intention of this, which I think will remain to be clear, is a phase out of tax credits for mature technologies and more of a focus on immature and commercializing technologies."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 691.45, "text": " There's also some tax credits being given to bring in biofuels into sustainable aviation fuel. What do you make of those?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 700.283, "text": "You know, we wrote a liftoff report at my insistence that we published right before we left office. And so to summarize, it basically says the EU refuses to allow any crops to be used in their SAF production, right? So to the extent that you're making SAF, you're making it for the EU.  They will not allow corn ethanol to be used in any of that SAF, so I don't really understand why you would do it. I think the Japanese program does allow for these sort of feedstocks, but I think you could dwarf the Japanese market pretty quickly by the existing plants that we've already funded out of the loan program's office. I'm a big fan of  biomethanol for the shipping. I do think that clean hydrogen is largely going to go into ammonia, which is what we always predicted at the loan program's office. So I think a lot of these clean fuels, what do you call it? Fights that people were having the last four years are starting to resolve themselves as to, you know, like which feedstocks go into SAF, which feedstocks go into shipping, you know, which feedstocks go other places. And so we're trying to figure all that stuff out. And the U.S. is clearly blessed with an extraordinary agriculture.  industry. But I think, as you also know, agriculture is not devoid of climate impacts. And so I do think that from a climate perspective, we're going to all have to be a lot more thoughtful about whether this is really serving us well on the climate side or whether this is really just a push."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 783.318, "text": " Speaking of the loan program's office, last time you were here on Zero, almost exactly two years ago, you were talking about the $9.2 billion loan to Ford to build batteries for electric cars. How much of the progress you made at the LPO will be undone by this bill or what has been done by the Trump administration so far?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 804.108, "text": " I think it depends on what you mean by undone. I would say that to date, they have not undone anything, right? So all of the loans that we issued have been honored to date. None of them have been unfairly rescinded or whatever you would suggest. I do think they've been slow to close the loans that I had laid for them to close. And so I'm shocked at how long it's taken for them to take the wins that we gave them.  So, if you look at the OBBB, it has more resources for loan programs office that's very specific to relabeling the 1706 program, which was energy infrastructure reinvestment program into the energy dominance financing, or they've relabeled some other stuff. So, they have a lot of resources, and so the resources that they have remaining  could match our production. So they could do another $108 billion worth of loans over this next four years, presumably in their preferred sectors like nuclear or geothermal or some of these other areas. But to date, they have not shown that they have a clear mandate around where to put that money."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 873.785, "text": " You had about $400 billion count here and there when initially we talked about it. There has been certain amount of rescinding happening, right? $3.6 billion for the Title 17 loan guarantee program, $3 billion for the advanced technology vehicles manufacturing, $5 billion for the energy infrastructure reinvestment program. So current loans that you have given out, those haven't been rescinded, but there are future loans that could have been given out under those programs that are gone now."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 900.667, "text": " Yeah, but I don't think it really matters all that much. I mean, this is all money that was set aside to do certain things, right? It was very clear that elections have consequences, and they were not going to do those certain things. And so having the money sit there and them not putting it out the door doesn't make any sense, and so they've rescinded it. Fine. And they've provided an additional billion dollars of new money for things that they do want to do. So they took some away, they put some more back in, and they can give us  the loan program's office more money in the funding bills that they'll be passing later this year, right? So that part I'm not concerned about. I do think that they have the resources to do the same amount of loans that we did, but in their preferred sectors."}, {"keywords": ["Executive Order", "Trade", "Tariffs", "Export", "Import", "China", "Apple"], "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 943.09, "text": " We'll be back with more of my conversation with Jigar Shah after this break.

Your feedback really matters and helps new listeners discover the show. Thank you.  Coming back to the politics of it, and I think you put it well, which is that, look, the clean energy industry in the US doesn't spend much, very small fraction, 1 20th of what the oil and gas industry spends on lobbying. But in the thinking of the Inflation Reduction Act and of the Biden administration, there was always this goal that if you bring both red states, Republican-led states and Democrat-led states,  together and you provide these tax credits going to all states, and especially in the IRA, much of it was going more than the majority was going to the Republican side, that that is what will hold these politicians to account and they won't cause self-harm by rescinding these things. So where did that fail and what lessons do you take from it for the clean energy industry"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1022.386, "text": " I think there are two different questions, right? So I think we need to be very careful about what we're concluding in these data points, right? I mean, President Trump is a very unique individual. Like when you think about his poll numbers and his actual voting numbers, he really won the working class in a very big way. But more than that, since 2017, he has remade the Republican Party so that he is the only dominant force and that everyone should fear him. When you have that much power over individuals,  then they do things that are blatantly in disregard for their constituents. And so whether it's out of fear, right, fear for their family, fear for reelection, fear for whatever it is, that does not invalidate the thesis behind the Inflation Reduction Act. When you think about 20 plus people on the Republican side in the House that signed the letter, plus you had, you know, four or five Republican senators that were genuinely looking to try to save all the incentives. And so when you think about  where this whole thing landed, it is terrible for the clean energy industry. And it was so much better than it could have been. And so I don't think that we should take from this that this is not a durable solution. In a million years, no one would have suggested that elected officials would actively sabotage manufacturing facilities in their community.  No one would have guessed that, right? This is the single largest assault on working class people that we've had in, I don't know, like since Ronald Reagan was promising to do that in the 1980s."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1122.61, "text": "We're also in this period where the US and Europe and the Western world in general is seeing electricity consumption rise at a level that it hasn't seen in decades.

I think what's going to likely occur is we're going to move much faster than even I imagined into the, you know, distributed capacity procurement, you know, that Spark Fund is doing in Minnesota, the virtual power plant programs that are being done across the country. I think what you will see in this moment is an enormous deployment of demand flexibility.  enabled by the batteries that, you know, got full subsidization within the O triple B.

So they no longer have to buy lithium or graphite or battery separators or whatever from local companies. But there's a production credit, right? So for every megawatt hour of batteries that they made, they got a payment. They still get those. And most of the existing battery manufacturing facilities in the US are EV battery manufacturing facilities. So they will continue to be put into EVs. And then, you know, I think some of the  the battery manufacturing facilities that were built a little more slowly are converting themselves into utility scale battery manufacturing facilities.

But I think what's happening is for the plants that were being built more slowly, they have an opportunity today to convert them to serve the utility scale battery market and not the electric vehicle market. And all of those conversions are being made.  So I think we'll still get to 400 gigawatt hours, but it'll be a bigger mix of utility scale versus electric vehicle batteries. But the electric vehicle batteries will still be, I don't know, 270 gigawatt hours or so. So that's why I'm saying I don't think we know how this is going to play out.

But given the rest of the world is speeding up on EV transition, it's not just China, it's also India, it's also Europe. Even Africa, you're seeing two-wheeler electric vehicles take off.

Both my in-laws and my  Uh, my parents just bought a plug in hybrid vehicle. They're both the same exact one actually. And it was 33 like miles or 34 miles electric. Almost all new models are heading towards 40, 45 miles electric for these plug in hybrid vehicles.

It says your gas is getting stale because you haven't used it in two months. Right. So it meets a hundred percent of their needs. And I put in a level two charger for them, but they won't use it. So they'll, they just plug it into the wall using level one.  because it's only whatever, 34 mile range. And they're like, it works fine. Like we don't need that. So I think you will see that America, because of the long distances that we drive, like what you will find is the vast majority of people will find comfort with a plug-in hybrid, and then they will solve their range anxiety by just using gasoline when they go beyond that period.

And if you look at this next week, there's a big conference in Detroit of all the major venture capital funds and others who voted for Trump. And they are all talking about putting up  tens of billions of dollars into re-industrializing our country. And so they're looking to pick up all these projects and to continue to build them, right? And so we'll see which ones succeed and which ones don't succeed and what they decide to do and what they don't decide to do. But that's the private sector leading. Trump is not going to stop them from leading.  Right?

And the fracking industry didn't cry in their beer,  They woke up and said, all right, let's figure out how to right size our supply chains. Let's figure out how to like get all of our suppliers to cut their costs. Let's figure out how to do all these things to continue to stay alive. Right. And they came out of that stronger than they went into that battle. But I think at the time, all of the stock analysts and all of the big newspapers were saying the fracking industry was dead.  Right? And so I think that when you think about all the times that I have been left for dead on the side of the road, whether it was in 2008 after the global financial crisis, whether it was after the Spanish program collapsed upon itself in 2009 and 2010, and people said people are never going to invest in Spain ever again, right? Whether it's in Germany and the manufacturing collapse of the solar panel industry there, like there's lots of times that our industry has been left for dead.  And we have risen and been stronger for it. I think it's important to acknowledge, yes, the clean energy industry is at war with this administration. And yes, the clean energy industry has what it needs to thrive in this moment. But, you know, along the way, 50 percent of our  companies may go bankrupt, right? The ones that weren't well capitalized, the ones who weren't run well, et cetera, may go bankrupt. And then the other 50% are going to probably thrive out of this and take the rest of the market share and continue to succeed. It is still the case that our technologies are the best in the world. And it is the only way we're going to achieve energy dominance. It's the only way we're going to unlock all these economic opportunities. But, you know, I think you can hold both of those ideas in your head at the same time."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 32, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1821.282, "text": " Well, I assume the clean energy industry wants to listen to this because right now things do seem quite dire and you are still bullish, bullish within the framework of what is going to be a tough challenge.

You guys are great. I can never tell them apart, but their mother can. I ask, can your mother tell you apart? And the answer is yes. Easily or is it tough for her?  Easy, I think. You guys have been great. Thank you very much. Great to be with you. Let me say the entire crypto community, for years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out. You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago.  But this signing is a massive validation. And even before this signing, over the last year, year and a half, I think your stuff has gone up more than any stock, or just about more. A couple of stocks that were pretty good, I will say. But you have certainly, as an industry, gone up more than anybody. Nobody's gained the respect in such a short period of time.  But this signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up, because a lot of people would have given up two, three years ago. So I want to thank you for contributing to the incredible strength of America. This is going to make it stronger. And congratulations on this incredible achievement. You've made our dollar look really good and strong and powerful. It's good for the dollar and it's good for the country.  And that's why I backed you at an early stage. And I also did it for the votes, because you did come out and vote. And they changed tune, you know. Biden's team, they changed tune right in the middle of the campaign. All of a sudden, they loved you guys. They dropped all charges. They did have, I got you guys out of so much trouble.  And you know what? I don't think anybody voted for him, right? Because you remember, you remember, they were very, they treated you very unfairly, actually. So it's a great honor that we were involved. And, and it was, it was a tremendous amount of support that we got at the polls. We won, think of it, we won every swing state. We won by millions of votes. We won the popular vote. We won the districts by 2,750. Think of that to 505.  Different districts, too, by the way. Every once in a while, that number can change, but it doesn't change by much. The map was almost totally red, and you guys were with us right from the beginning. Exactly one year ago this month, many of you were with me in Nashville, Tennessee. Do you remember that day, right? That was a big day, Nashville, Tennessee, when we became and I became the first presidential candidate ever to address the Bitcoin.  conference. And at this time and at that time, crypto builders and founders were under relentless assault by the Biden administration, which was trying to crush your industry and crush you as people and go after your families. And they were a vicious group of people. You know, people don't realize that they were vicious, incompetent, but vicious.  Well, Joe is an incompetent guy, but he was always known as a vicious guy. I guess if you're going to be in that, you're probably off if they're incompetent is better, right? Because you don't want to have a vicious guy that's competent. If you did, I wouldn't be standing here today.  But I pledged that we would bring back American liberty and leadership and make the United States the crypto capital of the world. And that's what we've done. And under the Trump administration, this is only going further. You're going to do really well. I mean, I'm so proud of what you've done in the last couple of years and very important on day one. I remember I did this and I said this and I mentioned this name and I got the greatest applause of the whole campaign.  We fired Joe Biden's SEC chair, Gary Gensler. We fired him.  But I remember I was making a speech, and it was just a line in a speech. And I said, and I will fire Gary Gensler. The place exploded.

My first week in office, I also established the first-ever Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets. And we have an executive director. Where's Bo Hines? Bo Hines. Hi, Bo.  And Bo is a great football player, right? Bo is a great football player, one of the better players in college football, so I know you from that also, see? Who would think that I know that? I know a lot of things, Bo.  But he was a champion player. I stopped the weaponization of government against crypto and Bitcoin, and we ended the lawless Operation Choke Point 2.0. That was a bad operation. And I kept my promises to the community and granted a full presidential pardon to Ross Albrecht. Ross Albrecht.  And you have no idea how important that name became. It was like a symbol. And his mother was unbelievable. His mother was an unbelievable woman. But it was so important to a certain group of people. And in the truly momentous act, last March, I signed an executive order establishing the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, as well as the United States Digital Asset Stockpile.  And that's all signed up. And with today's signing, we're pushing even further into the exciting new frontier. Just as I promised last year, the Genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stable coins. This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that. I don't know. What do you guys think? Yes?  If you say yes, I'm saying yes. I think it's great that you're involved, I will tell you. Many Americans are unaware that, behind the scenes, the technical backbone of the financial system is decades out of date, many, many years out of date. You know that. Paul and others are straightening it out. But payments and money transfers are costly and take days or even weeks to clear.  Under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st century upgrade using the state-of-the-art crypto technology. Who would have thought we would have been saying that two years after I really met you for the first time? The Genius Act provides banks, businesses, and financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed one for one.  with real US dollars, treasury bills, and other cash equivalents is really strengthening the dollar and giving the dollar great prominence. And you have this little group called BRICS. It's fading out fast. But BRICS is, they wanted to try and take over the dollar, the dominance of the dollar, and the standard of the dollar. And I said, anybody that's in the BRICS Consortium of Nations, we're going to tariff you 10%.  And they had a meeting the following day, and almost nobody showed up. They said, leave me alone. We didn't want to. They didn't want to be tariffed there. That's amazing. No, we're not going to let the dollar slide. If we have a smart president, you're never going to let the dollar slide. If you have a dummy, that could happen. Like the last one, he would, if you ever asked him about the dollar slider, he would have no idea.  But we can't let that ever happen again. Consumers, vendors, and people all over the world will then be able to use those stablecoins for ultra-low-cost transactions that are cleared and settled in a matter of seconds rather than weeks and months.  And it's really an amazing thing. And with the privacy, flexibility, and decentralization of cash, this revolution has the potential to supercharge American economic growth and empower billions of people to save and transfer in U.S. dollars. It's really all backed by the dollars. It's really  a great thing and a lot of, you know, we had a lot of Democrat support, I have to tell you that. I was shocked. Any time you get one Democrat, but we had a tremendous amount of Democrat support, which we appreciate it, which just shows you that you're doing the right thing.  This will increase demand for U.S. Treasuries, lower interest rates, and secure the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency for generations to come. The reserve currency is so important. You know, if we lost that, that would be like losing a World War. We can never let anyone play games with us. And that's why, when I heard about this group from BRICS \u2014 six countries, basically \u2014 I hit them very, very hard. And if they have a forum,  If they ever really form in a meaningful way, it will end very quickly, I will tell you, for them. They won't be gone very long. I don't think they'll even do it. They're virtually afraid to meet. I also remain fully committed to my pledge never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency in America. It won't happen.  Thank you. And the other night, I will say, with some of the Congressmen and women, they wanted that so badly. That was so important to them. You know, I was impressed that they knew what the hell it was, to be honest with you. Please, sir, please, the central bank, digital currency, we have to make sure. And I'm saying, what do you know about that? It's amazing the knowledge that people have gained all of a sudden. We had a lot of problems with some of them. I said, we've already got it from the Fed.  right, from commerce and from an executive order. You don't need it a fourth time. Sir, we have to get it. It's amazing. But they knew their subject, though, didn't they?  And we helped them out. My first week in office, I signed an executive order to ban the creation of a CBDC in the United States. And very soon, I look forward to signing legislation that will codify and ban the \u2014 make it a permanent law, put it in permanence. I'm also committed to signing landmark crypto market structure legislation this year to grow the industry. We're going to be growing it even more \u2014 more than people ever thought. It's a really hot industry.  And for a little while, two nights ago, we were a little concerned because we were a little short on votes. Like, I would say maybe we were about nine short. Nine short at three in the morning. We were about four short at three thirty in the morning. And we were in good shape at four o'clock in the morning. Right.  But the people and few people have fought harder for the bill than we're signing, than some of the people here today. You have been unbelievable. It's our White House A.I. and crypto czar, David Sachs, who has done such a great job.  I did his, he has a show now, he's become a showman, but a couple of years ago, that's probably two years ago now in San Francisco, and I did his show.  And I heard he's a very smart guy. And we had a great show. You've kept it going a lot longer. And you got is that still your highest rated ever show? He knows what to say. He knows what he had a rating that he had millions and millions of people. He said, what's going on? But we had a we had a great show. And I said, you know, that guy is really smart. I said, if I get elected, I was running at that time. If I get elected, we're going to bring him into government in some ways worth.  He's made a lot of money. He's a very rich billionaire. But this is more important, isn't it? Me too. It's like, does it matter? I know Howard and I talk about it all the time. Howard could go back to his wonderful brokerage firm, hire one or two people.  And it's not the same as what you're doing, right? We're doing the biggest deals in the world. Actually, the deal we're doing now in tariffs is the biggest, when you add it up, the biggest deal ever made in history. It could be 1,000 IBMs. I mean, if you think of it, it's the biggest deal ever done. So it's hard to go back to a brokerage firm and make a $79,000 commission on the sale of a sock, right?  That's true. But I want to ask David. So, David's been fantastic. He's done an incredible job.

It's just been incredible. President Trump has worked at tech speed. We're used to working fast in Silicon Valley, but even this is fast for us in Silicon Valley, the speed at which you move, President Trump. It's really incredible. And now today, you have another historic legislative achievement that is a monumental step to fulfilling your promise to making the United States the crypto capital of the world. This genius act will unlock American dominance in the crypto industry by creating clear rules of the road.  It will update archaic payment rails with a revolutionary new payment system. And it will extend U.S. dollar dominance, like you said, globally by creating a digital dollar that people all over the world can use. And for every digital dollar in a crypto wallet, there'll be a traditional dollar in a U.S. bank account, which will create trillions of dollars of demand for U.S. Treasuries. So that is the power of this bill is U.S. dollar dominance. This is a huge promise made and promise kept by President Trump. And there's just a few other people I'd like to thank. First, my family for being here. Thank you.  And Bo Hines, who President Trump mentions, the director of our crypto council, he really did the heavy lifting here. So Bo, I just want to thank you again. And my chief of staff, Tracy Johnson, as well, who also does the heavy lifting.

And again, we'll bring you any updates to the situation at JFK if we do hear anything. Well, as we mentioned, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller hinted he would dissent if his colleagues vote to hold interest rates steady at their July meeting. He's made his case for a rate cut to support the labor market.  Waller said he thinks Fed officials should take the step if, quote, you make it very clear you think at this moment in time it is important to do. He spoke in a wide-ranging interview on Bloomberg TV this morning and talked about inflation expectations, especially as President Trump threatens the tenure of Fed Chair Jay Powell.  After the tariffs came on, everybody was worried about de-anchoring expectations, particularly after some of these Michigan surveys came out. But I always look at the market-based expectation, because people have money in the game. Firms are making decisions on what their chief economists are saying. And if those things are wrong, they're going to lose a lot of money. So I've always paid more attention.  I haven't seen much in the way of market expectations being unanchored in any ways you want to measure them, any forward. Now, in the near term, of course they might go up, because you would see inflation in the short term. But in the longer term ones, I'm not seeing it. So either the market is just dismissing all of this as chatter and noise, or at some point if something happens such that it becomes much more serious, then you might see a discrete jump. And then that's going to be a problem for everybody.  One of the questions that we get all the time, Chris, from people on Wall Street is, or one of the posits they make is that all this criticism of the Fed is hurting Fed credibility and that the next chairman is going to have a tough job because there are going to be expectations for the next chairman set by the White House rather than by the economy. Do you feel that inside the building?  No, to be absolutely honest, we just do our job every day. I go in, I just focus on my work on monetary policy payments and oversight of the reserve banks. That's what I do. I let this stuff go and then just try to focus on my job. And I think that's how all of us are proceeding with this.  I mean, at the end of the day, the president winning, whoever they choose, you're going to have to have somebody that has credibility with the markets, or you will see, as Jonathan was just talking about, you're going to see inflation expectations spike. You will not get lower interest rates. You will get higher interest rates. This is well known. We've seen this everywhere around the world when this happens. And I know Scott Dessen knows this. So this is not something that is lost on anybody.  Well, there you have it. That was Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller earlier on a Bloomberg surveillance. Michael McKee was part of the team that did that interview. You heard his voice right there. He's international economics and policy correspondent for Bloomberg TV and Radio. When he did that interview this morning, he was in Victor, Idaho.  Now he's just a few miles on the other side of the border over in Jackson, Wyoming. Mike, I want to stick on the credibility with the markets. That's the part that Governor Waller ended on right there. Obviously, Jerome Powell has credibility with the markets. Based on the reporting that you've done, the folks that you've spoken to, do the frontrunners to replace Fed Chair Jay Powell also have credibility with the markets?  Well Jay Powell has a lot of credibility with the markets and we've seen that in market reaction to when Donald Trump has threatened to fire him. The markets have essentially tanked. Chris Waller has a lot of credibility with the markets and a lot of people say he might be Trump's best choice especially when you consider what  While I was saying about how the market would react if they thought the Fed had lost credibility interest rates at the long end which are the ones that matter for economic progress would probably go up because there would be concerns about whether the Fed is easing too much. So at this point there is credibility. The question is going to be who gets chosen and how are they seen. Are they seen as someone who is going to do the president's bidding or they're going to follow the tradition of the Fed and do what's best for the economy."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 470.641, "text": " Speaking of doing what's best for the Fed, I want to point out the most recent note by Neal Dutta over at Renaissance Macro, who has been weighing in a lot on this process. And in defense of Christopher Waller, in the idea of whether he would be... Okay, so this is what he says first. Waller is bending the knee to Trump or that he's losing respect in the process. Neal Dutta is knocking down that thought and he's saying,  Who isn't losing respect in this process? Importantly, what Waller says will be taken seriously by the people around the FOMC table, and many of those people are not in contention to lead the Fed and already agree with the premise of his argument. Okay, so what do you think about that, Mike? The idea that there are more people around the table who agree with this idea that perhaps the economy is not as strong as the White House might be claiming?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 519.612, "text": " I think everybody at the Fed feels that way. We heard it from Mary Daly in our interview with her yesterday. She sees the economy weakening. Now she's not signed on to the July rate cut but she does think they're going to have to cut rates going forward this year because the labor market as Chris Waller said is getting a little bit weaker.  And as far as bending the knee there's no question that a Kevin Hassett and perhaps a Scott Besant have done that in arguing in favor of the president's economic plans. A little bit less so with Kevin Warsh although he's a longtime Trump confidant. Chris Waller hasn't been seen as a Trump person. And I think what he wanted to do in his speech last night and in his interview with us is make  a solid economic case for why he would cut interest rates in July, which I think he did. Now, the question is, do you think if you don't cut rates, the economy gets a lot worse a lot faster? That's the nut question that will come up on July 30th for the members of the Open Market Committee. But I think what Waller was doing was demonstrating that he is not bending the knee, that he's looking at the economics of it, even if  It appears he's supporting Donald Trump's ideas. And of course, it's going to be a little tricky for Waller when it comes to July 30th, because the question will be, how committed is he? Would he actually dissent if the majority votes another way? You know, he spent a lot of time in that interview, Mike, talking about the importance of having conversations around this stuff and trying to bring other folks who are part of the FOMC and at least voting members of the FOMC  over to your side, present the evidence, show the economic argument, why you think rates should move one way or another, if you do believe they should move. Given what you heard from the Fed governor, do you think that July's meeting is a live meeting?  I don't think so for the reason that we have heard from most members of most voting members of the FOMC up to today. And the blackout starts after today. They can't talk until after the Fed meeting. And there's only two Waller and Vice Chair Bowman who have suggested a cut at the July meeting.  It may be that others feel that way and we might see something in the minutes about people feeling that they could go either way. But at this point they've led the markets to believe there won't be a cut and they don't like to shock the markets. And that's what would happen if they did cut rates. It's unpredictable what happens in the markets when something like that happens. So I don't think that it's really a live meeting but the minutes will be very interesting."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 668.095, "text": " Beyond the meeting itself, beyond the minutes, behind the economic data, how do you gauge the impact, the uncertainty around the next Fed chair is going to have on the bond market? We've talked about this a lot earlier this week, the idea that the term premium could be higher at the longer end of the yield curve, which is exactly what the treasury secretary doesn't want. So how do they resolve this uncertainty when the president keeps on weighing and criticizing Fed chair Powell?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 697.12, "text": " Well, you know, Chris Waller was essentially asked that question, and he said he thinks Scott Besant knows all about this and that he will recommend to the president that he not do anything that would upset the bond market.

That is something that the at least the people who are paying attention to the economy and who understand the bond market in the administration will have to keep in mind as they get close to a presidential nomination.  Michael McKee, international economics and policy correspondent for Bloomberg TV and Radio, joining us from Jackson, Wyoming. Mike, safe travels as you make your way back to the East Coast. Thanks for taking the time this afternoon. I do want to update everybody on a headline that we are following. That ground stop at JFK has been canceled. That's according to the FAA.  Just to update everybody, there was a ground stop. Departures were grounded due to an aircraft emergency. The ground stop probability of extension was 30 to 60 percent. We reported that earlier. The FAA reporting that that JFK ground stop has been canceled. Let's go to Washington, D.C. now and bring in Jordan Fabian. He's Bloomberg News White House editor. He's at our Washington, D.C. bureau. Jordan, I want to start with one of the most read stories on the terminal. You wrote it. It's about  President Trump authorizing the Justice Department to seek the release of grand jury testimony from the prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein. It comes after the Justice Department and FBI last week, though, said that Epstein did not keep a client list and that no more files related to the case would be made public. Is it fair to call this some sort of about face?  It's certainly an effort to appease his supporters who are angry with his handling of the Epstein case. But I will note that this move falls short of the level of disclosure that his supporters have demanded, including some members of Congress. They want witness testimony. They want client lists. They want FBI interview records, et cetera. And this would be a more limited slice  of those records, referring to the grand jury testimony. On top of that, the Trump administration has to go to a federal court to ask them to unseal those records. Remember that grand jury testimony is usually kept secret, and so this is not maybe going to see the light of day for a while, if ever, and so maybe a way to appease them now, but it certainly falls short of everything his supporters have asked for.  You know, you talk about it's not just his supporters. I've seen clips of the vice president, for example, on podcasts calling for the release of the Epstein files ahead of the election. I'm wondering politically where this is going right now, who's getting behind the president and who in the MAGA universe is saying, wait a second, there is more here that we want to see.  You're seeing Trump's inner circle in the White House and Congress rally around him, but there are significant cracks, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who's called for more transparency here in a rare moment of dissonance with President Trump. There's also those  outside conservative influencers and podcast hosts that helped propel Donald Trump to the presidency last year.

And that's because it again drew attention to his past relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. We had this weird situation where you have the president and his supporters last year  agitating for the release of the Epstein files, kind of spinning conspiracy theories that, you know, a lot of important people were part of his, you know, his inner circle and were perhaps participating in illegal activities where, you know, if the president is on tape and on  camera partying with Jeffrey Epstein at his estate in Mar-a-Lago in the 1990s. And so you had this weird situation, and that Wall Street Journal report kind of put that back in front of people's minds as he struggles through this controversy.  We should note, too, that the paper declined to comment on the president's litigation threat. Hey, I just wanted to, in the last minute or so that we have with you, Jordan, get an update from you on something that was reported yesterday. The president was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after experiencing leg swelling. The physician said he's in, quote, excellent health. This is coming from the White House.  on Thursday. How rare was it for the White House press secretary to sort of acknowledge something not great about the president's health? Or is this an OK diagnosis? What can you tell us?  The top line is it is unusual for this White House to be that transparent about the president's health. At the same time, this condition, as they described it, is a fairly common condition. It affects one in 20 U.S. adults. It's especially common in those over the age of 70.  But at the same time, it was interesting because that highlighted, you know, the president's age coming after a campaign where he hammered his predecessor, Joe Biden, over his age and fitness. And so, you know, I think the White House was especially cognizant that there were photos out there showing bruising on the president's hand, swelling in his ankles.  At the same time, they're trying to put that story to rest, saying it's not a major health issue, but it does raise attention to the fact that the president is 79 years old, the oldest man ever to be inaugurated, and time's only ticking.

The company reported second quarter earnings this morning. It boosted its net interest income growth forecast for the full year. Earlier this week, though, the company also agreed to buy Veritex Holdings for $1.9 billion in stock. That expands its presence in Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston.  Back with us is Zach Wasserman, chief financial officer of Huntington Bank Shares. It's the holding company of the consumer and business regional bank, Huntington National Bank. It's got locations in a handful of states, including Ohio, Minnesota, North and South Carolina, and more. Also with us, Bloomberg News senior editor Nina Trenman. She writes the Bloomberg CFO briefing newsletter, which you should sign up for at Bloomberg.com slash CFO dash briefing.  Zach is in Columbus, Nina here in our Bloomberg studio. Zach, I want to start just with the deal for Veritex in Texas that will accelerate your operations in the state. What attracted you to this bank in particular and to the Texas market?  You know, we're extraordinarily pleased with the opportunity to partner with Veritex. And, you know, a couple of things I would say. One is the Texas market in particular is incredibly attractive. As you probably know, it's one of the fastest growing states in the country. It's the eighth largest economy in the world, if it was a standalone country. And just the dynamism and the amount of business activity there is incredibly attractive. It's one of the reasons why we launched our own business there more than a decade ago, and we doubled down  with a local expansion in early 2024. But Veritex also is an incredible platform for us to partner with. They're a top 10 commercial bank in the state, and in particular focused on the two cities, as you noted before, the two MSA areas, Dallas-Fort Worth on one hand, and then Houston on the other hand, that we really are focused on. So we not only see a great opportunity to combine our activities, but to really build on that. One of the things we've talked a lot about is that this is a springboard.  for us to grow organically, not only now in the short term, but really over the longer term in Texas. It'll make Texas our third largest state, to give you a sense. So we already will have a very meaningful presence in that really great market.  Zach, can you talk to us a little bit about how that deal came together? We know, of course, many companies have been looking at dealmaking this year. Dealmaking is actually up compared to the prior year period. But still, of course, there are deals that are not going through because of tariffs and uncertainty. And how far did that impact your deal? And also, how did it come together?  Yeah. Well, you know, so we have wanted to expand and sort of continue to grow into Texas for some time. And we've been, therefore, evaluating a lot of opportunities to do that, both organically, you know, as you probably know, in North and South Carolina, we've just announced a  pretty significant organic expansion, building 55 branches and really doubling down, building out our whole franchise there. And so we were looking at opportunities to do the same thing in Texas and obviously evaluating lots of different ways to do that when we really began to talk with Veritex. And it came together pretty quickly. The first time we met with them to discuss a partnership in any specificity was in mid-June, so just about a month ago.  And it evolved quickly for us to see, wow, these are not only incredibly strategic opportunities, but the organizations themselves share a tremendous affinity in terms of culture and mission, which, as you probably know, that is the sort of secret sauce to make an acquisition in banking.  successful. The cultures need to be aligned. The teams need to work together. And we saw that there was not only the strategic opportunity, but the cultures fit. And then we were able to work together to find some of these growth opportunities that we could capture together. We said, wow, this is a partnership that we really should move forward with. And so on Monday, we were really pleased to be able to announce that.  Just turning to your earnings. Talk to us a bit about the past quarter. We spoke to you at the end of the last quarter and we're asking you do you see any signs of a recession in your business? How is your business doing? What are you hearing from clients now that we're three months later? How does that look?  Yeah. Q2 results were just phenomenal. And they really built strength throughout the quarter. To give you a sense, loans sequentially grew just under 2%. That's 8% year over year. That was at the high end of our guidance range that we had given earlier in the quarter. Deposits grew 1%. Fees were up 7% year on year. Spread revenue, 12%. Ultimately, we saw pre-tax earnings up 16% and earnings per share growing 25%.  year on year. So, it really was a bang up quarter. I will tell you, if you rewind the tape, and you go back to April, I would have told you, we had a lot of momentum, we felt pretty confident about how things would go, but there was clearly quite a bit of uncertainty in the market, and the capital markets were pretty volatile. Fast forward to June, and we saw strength build throughout the quarter,  loan and customer activity really firmed up, particularly in mid-May and into June. And now the third quarter is starting out with a bang. We just talked this morning with our analyst and investor community, and we shared that through the first couple of weeks here in July, it's pretty strong, actually. So all signs are pointing toward continued growth and certainly a very encouraging end of what was, to start with, a somewhat uncertain environment."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1590.044, "text": " Zach, Shonali Bhasak here. Thanks for joining us today. You know, even with a lot of promising information coming out of this earnings season for the biggest banks, for the regional banks, there seems to have been a pretty muted investor reception for firms even like yours that have boosted net interest income guidance. That should be a really good thing. What are investors telling you in terms of what else they want to see, why the muted reaction, even if things are looking pretty good?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1619.963, "text": " You know, it's hard to know what's on the mind of investors at any given time, as I'm sure you know well. Look, I think if you take a step back, the regional bank stocks have expanded a fair amount over the last month. So I think there's part of that sort of profit taking activity going on now as results come through.  There's also obviously worries around how will different banks fare under this fairly wide cone of uncertainty around where interest rates are going to go from here. Are rates going to stay flat? And could they even go higher or could they go lower? I'll tell you, for Huntington's sake,  we have positioned the business to be pretty neutral and to effectively have the same outcome if we have zero rate cuts or as many as four rate cuts from here. And so I think that's one of the questions on the mind of analysts. I think another one is as loan growth in the banking industry generally starts to pick up, which, by the way, is an incredibly healthy sign.  But as it happens across the industry broadly, what will that do to deposit cost competition and the benefits of interest rates coming down by around a percentage point relative to the peak of Fed funds over the last number of quarters here?  I suspect those and many other things are on the mind of analysts. For our part, I'll tell you, we put our heads down and we run the business. And I think what we believe pretty strongly is if we can keep posting that teens to higher earnings per share growth and revenue growth in the high single digits, that ultimately we'll see the stock prices continue to expand as they have been for the last several months.  as"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1733.532, "text": " big excitement earlier this week when the New York Times reported that Trump had written a letter and waved that in front of people in Congress.

We're speaking with Zach Wasserman, Chief Financial Officer of Huntington Bank Shares. Zach, since you do operate in these geographies, including Texas, Ohio, Minnesota, North and South Carolina, and more, you've got a nice regional view on where there is strength and weakness. Are you seeing any particular geographical weakness emerge anywhere?  Really not. I think pretty broad-based growth. One of the things we shared today in the earnings results is that, like we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth we're seeing is very balanced between what we're calling our core, all of the businesses we've been operating for a long time, but also our new initiatives. Excuse me. The launches we're doing into North and South Carolina, into Texas. Recently, we launched our business into South Florida.  and a number of new commercial specialties, and we're seeing a nice balance across them. So kind of across our traditional Midwest footprint, we're seeing strong growth in Michigan. I was just up with our Michigan-based team earlier this week, and we're seeing 6% year-over-year loan growth in that market, to give you a sense.  In Columbus and in our central Ohio region where I'm based, we're seeing very strong economic conditions and a lot of expansion. And then, of course, in some of the new geographies that we're growing into, North and South Carolina, Texas, Florida, we're seeing a fair amount of expansion there also.  not really seeing any areas of weakness.

However, when the market perceives the risk for long-term debt to be greater, the spread increases. And so we really need the 10-year Treasury to come down. Right now, if you're looking at technical analysis,  channelizing so it is looking to make a move. Hopefully that move is going to be to the downside bringing rates down and really that's going to be the biggest driver I would say for how we get the  the big, beautiful bill that was just passed.

So I would say the positive that we're seeing in housing is that at the state and local level, we are starting to see some reduced regulation to help with affordable housing, changing zoning laws. For example, Governor Newsom just changed the CEQA Act, which was enacted in 1970. So he's saying it's the biggest reform California is going to see in over 50 years.  years, which is going to enable developers to have less red tape, making it easier to develop in urban areas that have less than 20 acres. So not having to go through all of the environmental red tape that they had to and making it faster and cheaper. Because historically in California, it's really been a rich man's game to develop. And now people that have just written off development there are going to be taking another look. And so hopefully that and things like that at the state and local level are going to be able to help with the affordability while, you know,  President Trump's comments on the Fed, even if we do bring the Fed funds rate down 3%, like he tweeted a few days ago, that means we're probably going to be in a recession at that time.

In fact, in some cases, they're reporting their costs have come down even since the talk of tariffs. So we're definitely looking out for labor because of deportation issues. So places like California, they might be reducing regulations, but they could have labor shortages.  So we have not seen the impact of tariffs from our clients. They're not reporting that. And what's interesting is that publicly traded building supply companies are still operating at near 30% gross margins, while home builders peaked at about 27% gross margins in Q2 of 2022.  and they've reduced their gross margins 600 basis points, the building supply companies are still operating at that high gross margin. So what we think is going to happen is that there's really going to be a balance and a dance between, yes, the homebuilders are really eating into their margins to drive home prices down. They're buying down mortgage rates, offering incentives to keep people buying their homes. But they're going to be going back to their suppliers and saying, like, hey, now it's time for you to eat into some of your margins so that we can keep the homes.  as affordable as possible.

And so how are you starting to calculate what future tariff rates could look like on the impact of these home builders, given that there's still so much up in the air?

And I'm Lisa Mateo, filling in on Bloomberg Intelligence. On today's show, we dig inside the big business stories impacting Wall Street and the global markets. Each and every week, we provide in-depth research and data on some of the 2,000 companies and 130 industries our analysts cover worldwide. Today, we'll look at Bloomberg Intelligence' deep dive into dating apps and how Gen Z is using them. Plus, a look at how Trump administration policies are impacting the transition to clean power. But first, we begin with the tech sector.  Well, this week we heard that tech giants NVIDIA and AMD, they plan to resume sales of some AI chips in China. This came after U.S. government officials told the companies these shipments would get approved. For more, Lisa and I were joined by Mandeep Singh, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Tech Industry Analyst. We first asked Mandeep to explain the policies of the U.S. government as it relates to chips.  In mid-April, the current administration banned the sale of NVIDIA H20 chips. And remember, H20 is a deprecated version of the Hopper 200 chip that NVIDIA sells in the US and other markets. So it's not the highest end chip in terms of performance and power consumption.  but at the same time what uh they were able to do is to sell this deprecated version for a while and then mid since mid-april it was completely banned and so what nvidia did was they took down the guidance and they pretty much wrote off the inventory of the h20 chips  for their 1Q, partly was around $2.1 billion for 1Q. And then for 2Q, they guided for an $8 billion sort of headwind from the lack of sales to the China region. Now, with this new guideline around NVIDIA being able to sell those H20 chips, I believe it's a similar version to what they were selling before.  I think you could pretty much add, you know, I would say up to a $25 billion run rate annually in terms of sales to China. So think of Nvidia sales next year are going to be around $250 billion. That's the current consensus.  add $25 billion to that because that's how much they are able to sell to China as of right now. It could be much higher, but at least a 10% lift from being able to sell into China with these kind of lighter version of their highest end chips. So  I think it's a net positive. Same thing for AMD. AMD, the market is much smaller for them, given their market share in GPUs. But I would say AMD would get a similar lift, at least 10% of the sales expectations. So is there a difference between what NVIDIA can sell and what AMD can sell in China? Is it about the same as far as what the White House would say?  So AMD also has a deprecated version of their highest end chips that they're selling into the US market as well. Just because the administration doesn't want either AMD or NVIDIA to sell their highest end chip that's made on three nanometer node that has got a certain performance spec. And so they don't want the latest technology to be sold into the China region.  What they're okay with is an older version of NVIDIA chips that doesn't have the same level of performance as the current version and that they can sell into these Chinese companies and the administration is okay with that.  All right, Mandeep, I have no idea why the government's changing its policy, but it's good for these companies. Negotiation. Certainly. So we'll keep an eye on that. Do we know just offhand why they changed the policy? I mean, it's part of the bigger negotiation. The administration is focused on building more data centers here in the US.  For the companies to be able to do that meta, talking about super intelligence and all the CapEx spend, they need some stuff from China as well. So this is more about, you have the rare earth stuff, we have the chips, and it's part of the bigger negotiation. Our thanks to Mandeep Singh, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Tech Industry Analyst.  We recently focused on a Bloomberg story entitled, Stealth Stake Sales Helped UnitedHealth Beat Wall Street Targets. You can find it on the Bloomberg Terminal and Bloomberg.com. It discusses how until this year, UnitedHealth Group had managed to pull off an impressive feat, more than 60 consecutive quarters of earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. But now analysts are starting to question how UnitedHealth is arriving at these numbers. For more, Lisa and I were joined by Michelle Davis, Bloomberg Senior Deals Reporter.  We first asked Michelle about what she found out when she looked into UnitedHealth's earnings.  They had kind of a pristine record for more than 60 quarters. They beat estimates. Analysts love them. And at the end of last year, that got a bit harder for them to keep up. Medical costs were rising. The government's been cracking down on reimbursements. And that was eating into profits. And so what we reported is that at the end of last year, they approached several private equity firms and asked them if they wanted to buy stakes off of them, of their businesses.  And a couple interesting things happened here. Not only did they quietly do this, but the deals were structured such that United Health can be forced to buy the businesses back down the road. So it's temporary in nature. And United booked the gains in an interesting place. They booked them as part of operating earnings, or adjusted earnings, which is normally where you look to see kind of how a business is doing, excluding one-off gains or one-off events like this.  It was just interesting to see not only the fact that they stealthily did this, but where they put them. And without these gains, they would have missed estimates and profit would have dropped in the last quarter of last year. So as I'm going through this article, this certain quote stands out for me from an analyst that you spoke to. He said, if the company is manufacturing earnings by chopping up their furniture or selling their assets, that's not exactly a great business model. OK, so is the risk that it might be kind of masking this weakness in the operations?  That's the concern. And just to be clear, there's nothing illegal about what they're doing per se. They disclosed that they did this. Most people didn't see it. It was in a footnote in their 10K that kind of went under the radar. And there are no details about what exactly they sold. That's what we're trying to report on here. But yeah, the concern is it clouds your ability to see how the business is actually performing. And we heard from sources that there's a culture inside UnitedHealth of kind of  there being this pressure to do whatever you can to meet targets every quarter. Yep. It's a huge company, huge player in the managed care business. What's the underlying concern for investors out there, do you think, around this company?  UnitedHealth has been dealing with a lot of things. I mean, even before we knew about this, there was obviously the tragedy of, you know, one of their executives being murdered last year. And then, you know, there was a Wall Street Journal investigation this year about potential Medicare fraud, which they have denied. They also, in the first quarter, reported their first earnings miss in, you know, more than 60 quarters. So that shoe finally dropped. They ousted their CEO. So investors are just concerned about  the story here, you know, what is the UnitedHealth story? I think that's what the big concern is. So are there any other companies, like maybe other health companies or something like that, where this same story that you've been talking about kind of plays out? Not that we could find. It seems like UnitedHealth is really, you know, unique in its ability and history of, you know, really carefully managing its reporting every quarter. Our thanks to Michelle Davis, Bloomberg Senior Deals Reporter.  We move next to the IT space. This week we heard that the IT company Hewlett Packard Enterprise is creating a new strategy committee, and HPE is agreeing to work with activist investor Elliott Investment Management on ways to help the software company boost value. For more, Lisa and I were joined by Woojin Ho, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Technology Analyst. We first asked Woojin about the new committee HPE is creating.  It is a hand-picked board member by Elliott Management. Keep in mind, Elliott is an activist investor that has a 10% plus shareholding of HPE. I believe they made their position early in this year, and who they appointed was Bob Calderoni, who has done similar type of deals in terms of taking companies private or  More importantly, operational streamlining. So any changes, I think Elliot is going to try through Bob to affect a lot of changes at HPE. Mooj, just remind us what HP is today, number one. And number two, what do they need to fix to move this thing forward?  Yeah. Hey, Paul. So HPE is one of the leading enterprise IT infrastructure vendors. They provide servers, storage, now a bigger networking presence with the Juniper acquisition. And actually, quite frankly, there's quite a bit to fix. From an operational standpoint, they fumbled the first quarter results by mispricing their server business.  And it seems to be reconciled now, but it did flag some of the operational issues, number one. Number two, they have made a lot of M&A that just didn't create the synergies that they had hoped. So, you know, they did hire the former HP CFO.  to streamline the financials. And with the Juniper merger starting underway, I suspect that, you know, the new strategy board, it will try to find more operational synergies between the two networking businesses. Well, Jin, could you dig more into how it's under pressure, kind of like lagging behind Dell and growing AI? What kind of pressures are facing in that market?  Yeah, so if we think about AI, you know, HPE actually owns Cray. And we think about high performance compute, they are the market leaders there. HPE has not been able to transition that Cray business elegantly to the AI side of things. So let me put this into context.  I think HPE should be on track for about $3 billion to $4 billion in AI sales this year, possibly $4 billion to $5 billion, right? Dell is going to be on track for about $15 billion this year, and Supermicro is probably on track for about $20 billion this year. So, they've lagged on the AI front, even though they have some of the leading technologies in high-performance compute. That's an area that could be fixable under the right hands.  One more here before we let you go, Wooj, is just you mentioned they own Cray, they own Juniper. If I'm Elliott Management, am I thinking about maybe they could be selling or spinning off some of these businesses to enhance value?  Well, Bob Calderoni used to be on the Juniper board, and they actually helped with the operational streamlining of Juniper. So I think you want to keep Juniper. There are other aspects of the networking business that you could probably parse away. The Cray business, you'd want to keep, because AI is going to be the growth engine and also help you transition to the enterprise AI.

Bloomberg Intelligence recently did a survey on dating apps and how Gen Z is using them. And the survey found that Gen Z is dating less than most other generations.

So to weed out profiles that are fake or, you know, potentially send people who are sending harmful messages. And that is a common complaint.

We move next to news from the EV giant Tesla. This week we heard that Tesla shareholders will vote on whether to invest in CEO Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup XAI. That's according to Elon Musk.  Musk made the statement in response to an account on X that said the carmaker must be able to invest in XAI to be fair to Tesla retail investors. For more, Lisa and I were joined by Craig Trudell, Bloomberg Global Auto's editor. We first asked Craig what kind of message he thinks Musk's recent statement is sending. It's sending that Elon's business empire is becoming all the more intertwined. So this has been sort of a case  on and off for years. We can think back to, say, you know, the Tesla SolarCity acquisition, you know, and that's going back quite a ways. But, you know, in this case, it would be Tesla, you know, his most valuable company investing in sort of his up and comer and one where he's spent an awful lot of time and energy focused on lately as Tesla's electric vehicle sales have been slowing. He's been  really sort of dead set on taking on open AI and sort of standing up as a competitor to chat GPT. And as with all the companies in this space, spending an awful lot of money to try and compete in that realm.  So where do we stand here in terms of kind of how investors are viewing their investment in Tesla? Are they invested in a auto company or are they invested in an AI company? Are they invested just in Elon Inc? How do they think about it these days? Yeah. I mean, I think Musk has been trying for several years now to sell and position Tesla as much more than just a car company. Right.  It's definitely in the energy space and has a battery business to show for that. And in AI, he's talked a big game about developing self-driving technology. He's not gotten there yet, as we've seen with the company starting to offer rides in Teslas around Austin, Texas.  They still have Tesla employees in the front passenger seat to sort of take over in events where the cars have not been able to handle navigating the streets on their own. And yet with SpaceX, I think interestingly, for them to have just pumped $2 billion into XAI, I think there's a little bit of FOMO on the part of some in the Tesla shareholder base.  where they've seen, you know, XAI go from, you know, not all that valuable a startup to suddenly, you know, an extremely valuable startup. And they feel like they've missed out on some of this appreciation and want in on that. So with all that said, Craig, I mean, does must support a merger between XAI and Tesla or maybe XAI and SpaceX? You mentioned SpaceX too.  He says he does not. And, and I think there's been talk about this for years, right. That, uh, you know, and on and off again, there's been, you know, questions as to whether or not Musk is, you know, sort of stretched too thin and, and doing too much. Would it make more sense to turn, uh, his companies into, into one and, and sort of, uh, you know, sort of the, think about it as sort of the general electric of, of, uh, the new age, right. Uh, which is kind of fascinating because of course that didn't work out too well for GE.  And and yet, you know, even some of Musk's own allies have sort of alluded to, you know, viewing him and his empire as sort of, you know, a modern day General Electric. So he did take pains to say on MX that he does not support a full blown merger of Tesla and XAI.  But he has signals on there multiple times now that he would be in favor of Tesla putting money in. And that's, of course, a proposition that could be helpful if XAI continues to grow its valuation. We should note, however, that our colleagues have reported just in the last month or so that XAI has been burning through about a billion dollars a month.  This is a company that is really sort of cash hungry and needy as it's trying to stand up a business, you know, with all of this capability. Yeah. And Craig, it's been, I don't know, a month or two since Elon Musk left the U.S. government doge. Is there any evidence that he is meaningfully engaging with Tesla? You know, I think he's messaging more about, you know, sort of what Tesla's up to than he was while he was in Washington.  He did also post that he was in Tesla's design studio and sort of hyped up how excited he was about what he saw. But the company is sort of in this really sort of challenging state from a sales perspective. And you've sort of gotten indications that, well, maybe he doesn't necessarily fully have his finger on the pulse in the sense that he told us just within the last few months that sales have turned around.  A couple months later, the company reports that its vehicle deliveries had fallen 13% in the second quarter. So either he was not necessarily up to speed on the state of sales, or perhaps he was more optimistic that they were going to be able to turn things around than they ultimately were able to last quarter.

However, there's a couple of things that could be open to debate.  For instance, the interpretation of what it means to safe harbor these tax credits, which means proving that you're far enough along that you would still merit the tax credits once you become in service, those definitions could change. At the moment, usually there's a look at 5% of CapEx commitment or some amount of equipment being procured, that sort of thing as an indicator. If that changes, that could change which projects are eligible.

And that's hard because renewables are the fastest technology to deploy in the US right now. So the segment's been talking a lot about data centers around the need for more power in the United States. You know, that power is not going to come from nuclear tomorrow. It's going to come from solar, a project that takes six months to deploy.  What we're finding is that there's sort of a couple of sectors that are particularly impacted. Onshore wind, for instance, is affected a lot because it's quite location sensitive. What the tax credits did was it allowed more projects to be able to break even at the same rate of return, even with the change in the quality of the wind speed that was in that area. Now you're going to have to be a lot more picky.  Even with solar, especially things like rooftop solar, the tax credits that are available for homeowners are disappearing by the end of this year. When you're looking at more utility scale solar, we think that is more robust just because it's so cheap. But there are concerns around what's called the foreign  entities of concern, FEOC categorization, and how that will get calculated, how that exposure will get calculated once IRS guidance comes out. That could be complex because a lot of solar modules, despite an increase in local manufacturing, are still imported."}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 30, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1684.784, "text": "What changes could the act mean for data centers, for manufacturing sites?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade"], "line": 31, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1691.834, "text": " So, as of right now, a data center is much more likely to be operational if it's connected to the grid. So at the end of the day, the biggest thing that the US needs, which wasn't addressed at all in this budget bill, is more invested in transmission distribution grid networks so that you can actually connect.  Outside of that, renewables are the easiest thing to deploy. So if you're talking about more power demand being on the system, you need to generate more power. It's one thing to produce natural gas. It's another thing to make that into electricity that a data center can use. That requires a turbine. We're seeing very long wait times on the supply chain for new gas turbines for power plants.  Nuclear capacity, similarly, if it's not a restart, can take maybe a decade before it'll be online.

And so when we're talking about a transition to clean energy, which is what we all are aiming to do,  We have to make sure we remain with a stable grid and nuclear really helps with that. We've seen around the world that places that turn away from nuclear end up with dirtier and less reliable grids. But there are so many other benefits. For instance a nuclear power plant employs up to a thousand people who have  very high-paying, stable jobs, union jobs. It's the source of energy that uses the least materials, the least amount of land. And more importantly, as we're witnessing right now, it's a source of energy that has bipartisan support in the United States. The Biden administration was extremely pro-nuclear, and so is the Trump administration. So I think those are all things that we need to take into consideration when we're talking about a clean energy future."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 34, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1835.626, "text": " Isabel, so back in 2019, there was the Australian bushfire season.

Right now, 10 years ago, it was cryptocurrencies. Right now, we're talking about AI and the huge increasing energy demand.  And so I think, unfortunately, we just never run out of ways to use more and more energy. So while some progress has been made, our demand has also increased. So we're still burning a lot of fossil fuels. About 80% of the world's energy is still provided by fossil fuels. So we have to keep investing in these technologies. And this is where nuclear can play a really big role. It's already the second largest source of clean energy in the world, just behind  Hydropower, it is the largest source of clean energy in the United States. And I think for over three decades, it was completely ignored for a variety of reasons. And some of them is the fears around accidents, which we can talk about a little bit as well. So it's very important that we're now investing in this technology again, so that we can speed up this transition to clean energy."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1926.633, "text": " Isabel, talk to us about modular plants.

How that technology, could that be used?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 37, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1940.673, "text": " So I think we actually do need to build some of the large plants, because as much as small modular reactors, these new technologies that people are very, very excited about, unfortunately, if I'm a utility or a data center, I cannot go and buy one of those off the market just yet. None of these companies have built prototypes, so we're still pretty far from them being commercially available. In the meantime, we have to build  the existing technologies that we have, but some of the benefits that the small modular companies claim they will have is they'll be able to reduce costs, time to build, and so on. But again, all of this has yet to be proven, and so I think we cannot put all of our eggs in that one basket. We have to invest in technologies that we already know works.  So Isabel, you have a book called Rad Future. What's that all about? So Rad Future was inspired really by my own need to have an accessible book about nuclear electricity. To your point, in 2019 I saw the fires in Australia and the Amazon and that inspired me to do something using my platform that I had built as a fashion model.  to do something about climate. And at the time I tried buying books that explained how nuclear worked and I couldn't find anything that was accessible. It took me many, many years of research to get to a point where I could break down this information about nuclear, the history, the history of the anti-nuclear movement and the technology itself into something that was extremely accessible. And so Red Future was inspired by that, by a need to provide accessible material  And I think it's such an important topic that right now is being discussed everywhere.

Have we lost that already?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 30.625, "text": " No, I think we haven't. Like I said last night, the headline numbers for the labor market, what we're seeing, are OK. But it's like when you get underneath and start looking at the data, the private sector is not doing as well as everybody thinks it is. Most of the, half of the employment growth we saw last month was in the public sector. And that means the private sector is not doing particularly well. So I was just joking that, you know,  You know, if you're walking on a lake and the ice is frozen and it sounds safe, but when you start hearing cracks, and that's what I feel like, it's too late once you go through the ice. So you've got to start prepping in advance before you have that happen."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 69.439, "text": "How do you square that with what we've heard from corporate America so far? What corporate America has told Lisa sitting down with Scott Kirby of United Airlines talking about a rebound in the second half. What we've heard from the big banks so far this week. How do you square what you're seeing in the data with what we're hearing from CEOs?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 85.958, "text": " Yeah, I mean when I talk to CEOs I get the same thing. We're in just hold pattern in terms of certainly the labor market. They're not hiring, they're not firing, they're just watching. And that's kind of what you see in this underlying private sector data. There's not much happening. So it wouldn't take much to sort of tip it. Now, could I be wrong? Absolutely.  I mean, last year we got a couple of weak labor market reports that led us to cut in September, and then everything kind of reversed and went back up. So I'm not saying that couldn't happen again, but it's just we've constantly seen little bits of data continually coming down. The Beige Book yesterday came out. Some other stuff, when you get out of the jolts, quits rates, hiring rates, these things are not indicating a super healthy private sector labor market."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 129.665, "text": " As you know, you're facing potentially, and I stress potentially, negative supply shocks on both sides of the mandate. I want to sit on the labor market just for one further note. Immigration. How are you thinking about that when you look at the labor market at the moment? When we have people coming on the program, on Bloomberg Surveillance, on Bloomberg TV, every single morning, 6 till 9, coming on here and saying, look at the data. Unemployment could stay at these levels even with job gains of 50,000 to 100,000 because of tighter immigration. How does that factor into your thinking as you look at the US labor market?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 159.466, "text": " Well, yeah, the labor market doesn't necessarily have to be affected by it because if workers flow in and they get jobs at roughly the same rate as the existing workers, the unemployment rate doesn't change even though the labor force is higher. And when they go back out, the same thing happens. If they leave the employment and leave the labor force, you don't see a big change in the inflation rate. Now, it can potentially affect the break-even rate that you would need to have the market going well.  And that's what we're still trying to get a sense of. Because you basically brought five years of immigration forward. And of that eight or nine million, most of them haven't disappeared. So they're still here somewhere. Whether they're going to work, they're not going to work, but they're still here. Where I think the immigration stuff, if immigration was a big factor, you'd be seeing shortages. And you might see some in some industries. But like I pointed out, if you look at the new college graduate,  unemployment rate, it's 7%. It's much higher than it has. These are not jobs that are being opened up because immigrants are not coming in. This should be just the opposite. If immigrants are leaving and these jobs are open, then the unemployment rate should go the other way. So that unemployment rate to me is telling me immigration is not the source of the problem. Firms are just holding off on hiring decisions.  Even if their earnings are doing well, that's just what I'm saying they're doing on the labor side."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 242.68, "text": "I wanted to say there's a mutual friend of ours that feels like he's missing out this morning, so I wanted to catch up with you as well.

All the meetings are the same. Nobody dissents. Nobody does anything. And I think this is healthy. I think this is a turning point in the way we want to think about policy. Some people don't want to cut. Some do want to cut. But coming out and making the case either side  That's good, healthy debate. Otherwise, if we're always going to do the same, the joke is, why don't you just have one person set policy and send the other 18 FOMC members home? So this is healthy. I think this is what you want to see in a democracy. You want to see policymakers have serious, open discussion about where policy should go. It doesn't mean anything about politics or anything else. It's make the economic argument.  and then see if you can convince others to go along with you.

If you were to go in and do kind of a jihadist, I'm going to dissent at every single meeting no matter what happens, then you don't even have to show up. Everybody knows what you're going to do.  So it is important to make sure that if you dissent, you do it carefully, and you have the right reasons, and it's not going to turn into a serial dissenting potential case. I mean, that's how I take my job, seriously and responsibly. So I only would think about doing this.

And the answer is probably not. It could be. But it's also the reverse. Why wait till September if it's just six weeks? That's exactly the thing. It doesn't kind of matter. Just start thinking about, do I want to wait and risk something happening? This is what we saw last summer, by the way. We left July. We left rates. And then, boom, we got a very weak  Bad labor market reports. Unemployment rate jumped two-tenths. Payrolls went way down from where they were. And people were screaming at us last August, you guys should have cut in July. So one month, Ken, it always is one month. Just remember that. It's just one month.  But we live in a world in which we have to respond to real-time data to kind of sense of where the economy is going. And I've always said, if you worry about long and variable lags, which everybody always talks about, the whole point of that is to get ahead of it, not wait for it to happen, and then take a policy action that takes quarters or months down the road to actually have any impact."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 525.929, "text": "The new worry is tariffs. We've just had a six-minute conversation with you about monetary policy. You've built a case for lower interest rates, and no one's talked about trade or inflation.  Two assumptions in your speech yesterday, and I think they're important assumptions. A large share of tariff increases won't be passed through to consumers. Any increase would fade over the next year or so. What data underpins that conclusion?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 546.477, "text": "Well, one, it's just, first, it's just economic theory. So you put on a tariff. As long as it's a one-time tariff and that's it,  That's a one-time price effect. I mean, this is economic theory. You could not get in any serious economic model persistent inflation from that. You would have to cook up some other amplification mechanisms, and that's what people talk about. Wages will start going up and everything will get out of control. You're not seeing that at all. This is just not. Those kind of amplification mechanisms are wage-price spirals aren't happening.  Tariffs are a tax. And in public finance, you learn that you may levy a tax on a firm, but who bears the incidence or the burden of that tax? It can be a group of people or one person, not necessarily the firm. So this is what I've heard from a lot of firms. If there's a 10% tax, they'll force their suppliers to eat some of that cost. Workers may eat some of that cost in terms of less hiring and things like that. The firm will take it out of their profit margins.  And then lastly, some of it will get passed on. And as I mentioned last night, I've heard this for months now. The rule is 10% is roughly, rule of thumb is a third, a third, a third. Suppliers will eat a third. Firms will eat a third. Consumers are going to eat a third of that tariff. So if you eat a third of it, and it's 10%, like I've been arguing, this is like 3 tenths of a, 3 tenths on the inflation rate for a few months. And that's it.  And it'll persist if you do 12-month over 12-month. That base effect will not go away for a while, and then it'll just drop off a cliff. So that's why I've been arguing you want to look at like 3-month and 6-months to see if these tariff effects pop up and then go away. And so that's more critical than looking at 12-month."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 651.541, "text": " Yes, but the way the president is putting these tariffs on might not match up with theory, Chris. The Smoot-Hawley tax was passed and came into effect on a certain date. The president has not yet put on most of these tariffs. They're in theory still coming.  And we still haven't seen the Section 232 tariffs for the most part, the national defense tariffs that he wants to put on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, et cetera. So if the process is stretched out, consumers could be hit by a series, an ongoing series of tariff increases. And given what they've just been through, isn't there a danger that inflation psychology starts to seep in?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 688.219, "text": "Well, that's exactly the point. All my example has been is if you put the 10% uniform tariff on and keep it roughly in that range,  then what I've described is what will happen. If there's constantly a sequence of higher and higher and higher tariffs, then you are going to get this rolling potential impact on prices. That's true. If it's still just a question of delaying it, that doesn't change my argument. Whether you see the spike in July or it happens in June or August or September, when it happens is irrelevant for the economics. That's a non-starter of an argument.  Firms could also just spread it out in smaller increments over several months. The total effect still ends up being the same. They just get there in a later fashion. And it will be smaller amounts. So the bigger thing is if we just continue to get another wave of tariffs, another wave of tariffs, another wave of tariffs, that's when things become more problematic thinking about what's going to happen with inflation."}, {"keywords": ["Tariffs"], "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 745.298, "text": " You don't think the Federal Reserve should wait. I just want to talk about the experience of last year. I think Lisa's done a fantastic job of covering this over the last six, seven, eight months.

Growth was up, productivity was up, employment suddenly took back off. And then you have  real growth expectations being much higher. We were seeing productivity growth and GDP growth of close to 3%. So in that case, long rates go up anyway. So it's not necessarily there was some counter-reaction to what we were doing.

And if those things are wrong, they're going to lose a lot of money. So I've always paid more attention. I haven't seen much in the way of market expectations being unanchored in any ways you want to measure them, any forward. Now, in the near term, of course they might go up because you would see inflation in the short term.  But in the longer term ones, I'm not seeing it.

But for example,  I'm getting medical records from my clients a lot. That's a lot of the job of a plaintiff side lawyer is documenting injuries, things like that. And they're certainly concerned about their medical privacy. And so I can't use AI yet to take the medical records and condense them into quick summaries. But those programs I'm sure are coming where there's privacy and security and all of the things. They probably exist already. I'm just not using them yet.  to make that part feasible. I am sure that if you are Goldman Sachs, and you hire a big law firm, and they've been doing your deals or your IPOs, such as they exist right now, and you don't want the law firm training on your documents to go use them in other deals, I'm sure this is an issue.

And you can sort of do that math of the expected value of the case, and then think about how many hours it's going to take to win that case or get to a settlement.  If I'm using AI to make myself more productive in my research, the number of hours that I'm expecting to put into that case goes down. Suddenly, my hurdle rate for what it takes to take on that case has gone down, and I can take on more cases for the same number of hours. And so that I definitely think is coming. And because of that, because lawyers have to think in that term of how much is it going to cost me to do this case in terms of labor,  There are a lot of cases brought pro se in the court system right now. I think it's like 20, 25% of cases are from pro se litigants. These are the people who represent themselves. Who represent themselves because they can't afford a lawyer or, you know, my cases are contingency. People aren't paying out of pocket. But so I can't afford to take on the case because the damages aren't potentially high enough. That's how I have to sort of think about it.  And so I think there's going to be a lot more representation of those people. It's also the case probably that pro se lawyers are going to start getting better.

I don't know the degree to which it's really happening, but at least in theory there's going to be firing of junior workers, etc. But that's a temporary condition because, first of all, a company saves a bunch of money by firing what eventually becomes characterized as grunt work. Well, what do they spend that money on? Because that's savings.  And so, do they invest it? Does that turn into consumption for the partners? People are like, oh, it's going to be mass layoffs.

We've asked for a bunch of questions, and we're going to rattle through as many of them as we can this episode. You're going to hop in whenever warranted. Eric, the first question I'm going to ask of you comes from John Andrew Carter, Jr., who asked, what's the next big tech innovation in exchange traded funds that will affect the way I invest?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 87.022, "text": " I'd have to go with the ETF share class, which is coming out this summer, probably, later this summer or early fall, where a mutual fund will just be able to bolt on an ETF share class. Only Vanguard does that currently. But there's, I think, over 60 different active managers that have filed for this, basically, exception to a rule.  And if they get approved, which we heard they will, we're looking at basically all mutual funds will, I mean, not all of them, but a lot of them, you'll be able to just transfer from your mutual fund share to your ETF share. So I think for people out there who have been wanting to leave and not have a tax hit when they leave, they can now do that.  And it should be very interesting. I think it will be a drain from the mutual fund to the ETF. But that money was probably going to go over there anyway. This just makes it a little easier, more tax-efficient, and it lets some of these old legacy active managers save a client rather than losing one.  That's, I would, it's not the most interesting tech innovation. I think that's what they're talking about. Tech with the structure. Would you use something different?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 156.916, "text": "No, I think that's spot on. I was thinking maybe like tokenization, which is like what Robinhood's trying to do. They just announced that. That could be something, you know, maybe  allowing access to things that were not able to fit into the ETF, like private equity. That might be a tall order, right? ETFs give you a really good deal. You have pretty much access to everything, but I think that the tokenization story is going to be around for some time."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 184.795, "text": " Okay, as long as we're talking about tokenization, Alvaro Martinez asks, as tokenization of real-world assets gains traction, how do you envision tokenized ETFs transforming the traditional ETF structure, particularly in terms of settlement efficiency, investor access, regulatory oversight? Could this technology catalyze the emergence of 24-7 ETF markets or fractional ownership beyond what's already achievable with standard ETFs?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 214.259, "text": " So, it's very interesting. It's exciting, too. Robinhood just announced they're tokenizing everything for Europeans who want to get easier access to U.S. equities. And they even said, oh, we're going to tokenize VU. But there's already a Vanguard S&P 500 ETF in Europe called VUSA, which is easily accessible and cheap. So, I think when you think about tokenization, what does it actually do?  If anything, it cleans up the back office a little. Using the blockchain, you can have faster settlement times. You could do 24-7, but how many people really need that? I think the big thing for tokenization is for people who don't have access to a stock market. For the developing countries, tokens can be a lifesaver, especially stablecoins, which are just basically tokenized dollars. I'm very bullish on that.  But for the developing world, for the developed world, where we all have the ability to roll out of bed in our underwear still, roll over to Schwab,  open up the internet and hit buy, and we can own almost anything under the sun in one second for almost no fee. I just don't really know how you're going to disrupt that. That's about as clean and easy and low-cost as you could possibly get, and convenient. So I think the tokenization story will be one of a back-office story. I think they'll use the blockchain to  maybe streamline some stuff in the back office, but you as the user probably won't notice the difference. But I could be wrong. I'm bullish tokenization as a back office disintermediator, but I'm bearish tokenization in terms of killing the ETF, at least for now. I'm evolving on this issue, but I just don't see enough to disrupt what I just described in the rolling-out-of-bed visual."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 332.249, "text": " I mean, I mostly align with Eric on this. The back end, do people really care about that, for the most part? It's pretty good already. They're already trying to move the T1 settlement anyways. I think the benefits are marginal. Like, okay, 24-7 trading, whatever. It's not enough benefits to be a disruptor, like the ETF was to the mutual fund. It might give you access to some cool stuff, but I'm with Eric on this one."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 360.814, "text": "The other thing is,  What is an ETF that would be cool if it was tokenized? Okay, private equity, maybe, art, stuff like this. But a lot of that, like private equity, let's take that, you can't really sidestep the regulations and just have a token out there for retail. I believe that the regulators won't really appreciate that.  Even if something seems like, oh, it hasn't been ETFized, a token would fill in. I don't know how cleanly you can get that done without dealing with regulation. So, the regulatory issue is a whole other problem here that will have to be surmounted. That said, this particular SEC, somebody had commented to me when I was basically saying,  I'm not really bullish on Robinhood. And also, you see the guy from Robinhood, looks like Johnny Depp from the movie Blow, and he's out there talking about tokenization in Cannes, Paris or whatever. I mean, it was pretty showy, and I'm not saying he's not smart, but when I think about that company,  trying to advertise is like, oh, we're going to give you all this stuff for low cost. And then I think I like Jack Bogle and Vanguard. I just don't know if people are going to leave that Boy Scout trust, the Vanguard and BlackRock and move over to Robin Hood, at least the big, giant blob of money, maybe some of the younger people.  I don't really see that being that attractive. And if something's free, if Robinhood's saying it's free, don't trust me. They are charging you somewhere else. It's probably going to pay for order flow. They're probably selling your order flow to Citadel, getting money there, and you don't know it.  So, be careful out there when it comes to those kind of pitches, in my opinion. And so, I don't know. I'm just skeptical, because the U.S. ETF market is the pterodome. It is so hard. I've seen so many legacy companies come here and get humbled. It's hell for issuers, but heaven for investors.  And that hell is something that I feel like Robinhood's trying to sidestep here. I have more faith and I'm more bullish on companies that have come into the ETF teardome and figured out a way to survive and thrive in an honest fashion. So I'm not willing to let go of all that and be like, oh, tokens are the new thing. Can't do it. No, I'm with you."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 500.459, "text": " Okay, just on the topic of tokenization, Brian Tovar asks, from a custody ownership perspective, what's the difference between owning a tokenized stock versus an ETF stock?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 514.955, "text": " I mean, that's kind of where I get hung up is, I don't understand the difference. If Microsoft is Microsoft stock and you're owning that in a token form, why not just own the ETF, own Microsoft stock? Unless they're issuing tokens, like Microsoft tokens, why I don't still...  struggling to wrap my head around, besides the back-end benefits and maybe 24-hour trading, those sort of marginal benefits, what's the real meaningful difference between the two?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 541.041, "text": "The other problem is, you've got all these market makers and APs involved that people don't see, and this is like heavy-duty liquidity and financial institutions, and they're smart.  They arbitrage the price and the underlying all the time. And I've asked people, what's going to happen if people start using tokens? Will the whole Wall Street apparatus just move over? Because then, what about exchanges, too? And there are some people who say, all that's going to go away, and everything's going to be on the blockchain.  A couple things. A, I think you're going to find percent premiums and discounts. Some people say we can automate the market-making. Eh, I don't know. I think the system right now is what we call anti-fragile. You can call somebody. People have experience. There's many of them. The token world seems like, okay, we could save a little time on the settlement. You can trade 24-7. Costs are going to be the same. It's not like tokens are going to be cheap. You can't be cheaper than ETFs. Again, it's marginal benefit for a lot more fragility.  it seems to me. As I've joked about with somebody on Twitter, centralization has its benefits, which means you can call somebody. If there's a real problem, you can take legal action. There's prospectuses. This is where I think centralization has its perks. Whereas you go full DeFi, it's a little Wild West. So I don't actually know how all these questions will be answered. Again, the reason ETFs were such a big hit is because mutual funds were  Slow, expensive, not that liquid, and a lot of the costs were internalized. The taxes weren't good. ETFs corrected like five things. I mean, it was like five evolutionary steps. Tokenization seemed like one little baby, like a little mouse step."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 646.09, "text": " I feel like it doesn't change the experience, right?

They have $11 trillion in assets, and they bring in, what, $10 billion in revenue every year? Maybe a little more. And the market makers make about that, too. But to contrast, I believe mutual funds pull in $125 billion in revenue.  It's just like, and hedge funds pull in like triple ETFs and they have less assets. So every other structure makes way more money. That's why when I go to these crypto conferences and they think they're like the big disruptor and I'm like, dude, ETFs are way more punk rock than you think. That's why all the money goes into the Bitcoin ETF is because it's so cheap and easy that the ETF has a lot of disruptive power because the consumers know it's a good deal.  They will sell you out for an ETF that's two basis points cheaper. I mean, they are brutal consumers. But when you service them, and like you said, if you can make it there, you're going to do well. Now, there's certainly room for some ETFs to be profitable. You can carve out a good living there. BlackRock is probably the best example.  And then, there's some Hail Marys that do well, like the 2X Nvidia. That makes $6 million a year. So, there's been some one-off Hail Mary ones that have really done well. But for the most part, it's a hard business. It's tough. Wall Street would rather ETFs have not been this successful. I can tell you that."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 771.269, "text": " OK, follow up question from same user. What will happen to see a Bitcoin or Ethereum ETF sell off their assets and shut down and say they're on the bottom of the list for flows? Are they still profitable?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 784.041, "text": "So a Bitcoin ETF, even the lowest one of the spots.  is totally profitable. That's why this was such a crazy launch. I think WisdomTree might have the least of the 11 or 12 out there, maybe hashtags, but they're all in profit mode already. That's rare. Now, on Ether, I believe the couple towards the bottom are maybe not profitable. I would say, if you're going to charge $25-30 bps, which is what they most charge, you would need about $80 million  to be profitable. And I don't know if all the Ether have that. So, over the next five years, the spot ETFs look pretty good, but there's going to be some option overlays. They're going to try all kinds of stuff. And there will be closures that are in the crypto ETF space, for sure.  And if a closure happens, if it's a company like Wisdom Tree and they close a fund, the company's still profitable. They're just choosing to close that fund rather than put more money into it to try to sell it to make it profitable. It's really no different than any other business. You attempt all these products. You hope some of them hit.  usually have a couple blockbuster hits, a couple in the middle, and then maybe a couple duds. Some issuers will keep those duds alive longer than others. Some close quicker. But I'd imagine in the crypto space, since it is so fledgling and new, you'll probably have them hang in a little longer than if they were trying some random theme ETF."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 867.946, "text": " Okay, you're now understand.

So it doesn't even need any new flows. Just a nice little run in Bitcoin, it will be the number one most profitable ETF from BlackRock at a year and a half old.  It's absolutely bonkers. So, that said, people are like, oh, BlackRock is getting away with murder here. I'm like, not really. 25 bips for that is pretty fair. Up until BlackRock came out, you had to pay 2% or 1.5% at best in Europe or in hedge funds. So, 25 is dramatically cheaper. I think this is a win-win.

Sorry. Yeah. Just, hey, it's cleaner. Okay. Anyway, Strategy. He said, mark my words, iBit will be the biggest ETF. So, I did the math on this, and I think he said within 10 years. I did the math, Joel. It would have to like...  quintuple its flows, VU would have to chill, and the S&P would have to stop going up and Bitcoin would have to rally. So, a lot would have to happen. In that scenario, I think you have a case where maybe the U.S. stock market has real issues, and somehow Bitcoin is looked at as the savior asset, and it just goes up and up while the stock market goes down.  That scenario hasn't really happened. Bitcoin tends to have a little more correlation to stocks. As long as it's correlated to stocks, I don't see how that's possible. But iBit's rise, it's now the 23rd biggest ETF of all time at 1.4 years old, which is insane to be that high that quickly. I will never say never with iBit.  I thought VTI would be bigger one day, because VU and IVV would be fighting over that same assets and the total market.

But I feel like with all these ETF options, single stocks, people are their own active managers now, right? So instead of going to Cathie Wood to buy these stocks, there's single stock versions of all these. So they just ended up doing it themselves.

It's sort of like this new generation of active, mostly derivatives usage and things like that."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 31, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1249.287, "text": " Yeah, I think active is taking in 40% of all the flows, and that sounds like, oh my God, active is back. I could see a reporter tempted to write that headline, but as Ethan said, most of it is buffers and derivative-using stuff that is more solution-oriented. That said, there is some traction with traditional grandpa stock-picking active.  You've got Capital Group, DFA, JP Morgan, JP Morgan in particular. And one of the reasons it's finally working is they got cheap. Most of the products that take in money from the grandfather active have now got their fund under 40 basis points. So, I think there's definitely a group of advisors out there that still believes in active, but they want it served up a little cheaper. I just want to pay for the active, not  all the beta, which you can get for free in a Vanguard fund. So, I think Active is going through this repricing of how much it's actually worth. And as it goes through that and gets a little cheaper, I think it will see actual real flows. But there's all the newfangled stuff that kind of makes the Active rebound story a little more complex. And just on thematic ETFs, I just looked today, actually. They've taken in $2 billion this year out of $560 billion of flows. So, not a lot.  When you look at themes, if you look, some themes are on fire, like defense. Everyone's taking your money, it's a feeding frenzy. But then ARK and the US infrastructure and the natural resources have seen outflows. And so you tend to have whatever's going on in the market, there's always some theme ETF killing it, and there's always some that's suffering. So theme ETFs have a lot going on underneath.

I used to teach the new higher class and I'd go over creation and redemption and their eyes would glaze over. And in my survey, that's when they'd say that part sucked, everything else is interesting.  So, I actually reframed it, and I told the story of how the ETF was designed. And I start with, like, you know, the American Stock Exchange was in third place. They were looking for a winner. And Nate Most was, I don't know, in his 60s or 70s at the Amex, and he had worked at a commodities warehouse.  When he was thinking about how to design the ETF and make it so that costs of trading wouldn't infiltrate the actual costs of the ETF, which would affect all the shareholders. How do you separate trading costs from the shareholders? He thought about Commodity Warehouse that he worked at.  And he thought, well, in that warehouse you have a bunch of soybean oil and you bring it to the warehouse, they give you a receipt for your soybean oil and they store it for you in a locker. Then you can trade your receipts with other commodity traders without having to move all the merchandise around, right? Makes sense. And let's you get a bunch of receipts and you want actual soybean oil back.  Then you take your receipts, and they give the exact proportion to soybean oil, and then you have your goods. So all he did was take that structure, that paradigm, and say, instead of soybean oil, what if I had the S&P 500 stocks? I could then take it to this warehouse, which is State Street and the Custodian, and I get a receipt.  for SPY, and that receipt is worth 50,000 shares worth of receipts. Then I can sell those in the open market. People can just trade these receipts all day long, and then if there's a surplus of receipts and we need to do a creation or redemption, we'll go back to the warehouse.  So all it is is a commodity warehouse paradigm applied to stocks and bonds. And the reason that's cool is because, again, when the receipts are trading, it's basically everybody trading. All the tax implications and everything is on them. And when a creation redemption happens, when you bring the stocks in exchange for the receipts or shares, there's no money changing hands. And so when there's no money changing hands, there's no taxation.  And so, there's no tax consequence in the creation-redemption process, which is the magic of why ETFs don't kick out capital gains distributions. I love stories like that, because a lot of times, Steve Jobs always said, nothing is wasted. The font he made, the calligraphy and the early Apple he got because he just used to skip class and go to this writing class.  Things that happen in your old life can come in really valuable, or something you see overseas, you apply it to your country you're in.

Whether you sell or they send you a check because they redeemed the funds, you've got a capital gains distribution if the fund went up as you bought it. That's why closure risk is real, but it's not huge. It's not like loss of principal risk. You can never lose your principal in an ETF, but the closure risk is just annoying, and nobody wants to deal with that. Again, people hate taxes, so that's the problem.  You don't like to see ETFs liquidate, but usually they don't liquidate if there's hardly anybody in there. There's very few casualties to ETF liquidations in general. This is part of why it's hard in ETFs, because a lot of advisors, in particular, won't use you unless you've got $500 million, $1 billion.

Bank of New York already has zero fee. That already exists. Here's the thing about zero fee. If you talk to people, brand is huge. And so, unless BlackRock or Vanguard or State Street did zero fee, it won't matter that much. People are going to go with that brand and three bips. In fact, I think some people like paying a little, because it feels less like you're going to get ripped off somewhere else.  So I think three BIPs, five BIPs, people are going to want to build portfolios with ETFs under 10 basis points for the next 10-20 years. Again, tokenization is certainly one thing. Perhaps tokenization can improve some of the back office stuff, but again, that wouldn't totally affect anybody. If anything, that would just help the issuers more, maybe save a little money.  But, look, I think what's going to be tested is, they're going to put stuff in ETFs that's just not liquid. And that's, I think, where we're going to find some experimentation, where, I guess, private equity, private credit, maybe they'll try to put something like  I don't know, farmland in Nebraska. Something that an endowment would invest in, we'd call those real assets. I would be fine with that. I think it's okay to break an egg once in a while to get the omelet. So, I'm okay with  experimenting with ETFs, but it could get very interesting in terms of testing the durability of the ETF. But the other thing is, you have to look overseas. That's where a lot of growth opportunity is. They're just waking up to what fees are and how to make money long-term. To me, the ETF story is maybe fifth or sixth inning in the U.S., but it's second or third overseas. That's what I would look for. But I do think we're going to see a lot of crazy.  Because Vanilla is so hard to compete in, you will see more people launching stuff that's pretty out there. And it will get a lot of copy, because it's interesting, but just relax. Almost all the money is going to go to the VU type stuff, and that's probably for the best.

What's happened in the last 20 years is we've seen FedEx Ground develop this independent contractor network across the country, and it's grown significantly. And Amazon effectively replicated that five or six years ago. So you have these two very large, low cost, high service networks.  And effectively, here's UPS that's fully unionized, fully Teamster contracted. And they're really struggling because they're the high cost provider with incrementally more challenging service. So the way we see this, and we saw this play out in the less than truckload sector, because there was a big competitor there, yellow roadway, which was unionized and old Dominion, which is one of the highest valued stocks in my sectors.  really took a lot of share and ultimately Yellow went out of business. So I'm really worried that this uncompetitive dynamic where UPS has a contract that the others don't, we see parcel shift going towards Amazon and FedEx long term. So what's the plan? Yes, it's a dividend play, right? I mean, what else is there?  I think they're yielding six or six and a half percent right now. And I don't think they're going to cut the dividend anytime soon. But if you listen to UPS, Amazon is a 20 percent customer in their domestic U.S. network. And Amazon shrinking that by half in the next two years, it's going to really hit in the back half of this year. And UPS has come out and said, look, we need to shrink our domestic network by 10 percent. That's going to be really challenging in these very time definite pickup and delivery networks.

I mean, there's some real garbage out there. Is that stuff going to slip through the cracks because of a more entrepreneurial regulation?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 69, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1861.04, "text": " Well, let's talk about that. So Corinthian Colleges not only engaged in some serious misconduct against students and loading them up with debt for worthless degrees, they also were defrauding functionally the federal government out of public funds. So I do think that, and my experience has been that sometimes when there is a push  for letting animal spirits run wild, a cost of that is more funds, public funds, being siphoned away to bad actors, but also individuals engaged in serious, serious destruction of their own financial life.  And really, no one is there to fix it. And I don't know if the market system in the U.S. thrived from just no rules. In fact, many people would argue our securities laws, our patent laws, so much of that was critical  for really driving a lot of innovation. And our government investments, which helped incubate, you know, Siri, GPS, so many transformative technologies from NASA and DOD, if that is all gutted too, that means our private sector won't be able to run with it. So I'm really not sure that this is good for long-term growth to have a sort of no regulation, no law enforcement type approach.  Rohit, we have to go there. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau basically just had proposed to keep medical debt off their credit reports, but that ruling was just overturned by the White House by Trump. More than 15 million people have nearly $50 billion of medical debt on their credit reports. Talk to us about the impact of that. Is that good for the American household?  Well, so here's the deal. Lenders really want to know what people have borrowed. I think the difference with medical debt, and there's been a series of studies that we conducted on this, those medical bills are not really predictive of whether or not someone will repay an auto loan or a mortgage.  The circumstances are totally different. And we also find that many of the medical bills that are parked on credit reports were either already paid or were never owed in the first place. I think we've all experienced this, that loop between the insurance company and the medical provider.  So I think this is going to have a negative consequence. It's going to lower credit scores for many people. It's going to make it tougher for people to really take those risks when it comes to borrowing for their first home or advancing in their financial life. So I again, I just think this is a total SOP.  to the medical debt collectors, debt buyers, and credit reporting. Well, just to clear this up for our audience, I mean, these credit reports are the same things that households need to get a mortgage, right? To get an auto loan, a small business loan. So I've got to believe that if this stuff is included on their credit reports, you're absolutely right. It's going to make it a little bit more difficult, one would think, to take out a loan, right?  Yeah, and I just think we want the information on credit reports to truly be accurate and we want it to reflect loans that people have. I really worry that, for example, all of these buy now pay later loans  They're not necessarily\u2014I had auto lenders complain to me, how am I supposed to know what people owe on buy now, pay later? And again, we see this new CFPB just completely pardoning and letting these buy now, pay later companies do whatever the hell they want."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 70, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 2085.058, "text": "You had an extinguished career at Wharton, and then before that at Harvard.

I'm Max Chafkin. And this week, Max, I would argue that the theme of the week is should I stay or should I go?  Yeah, you got President Trump pondering whether Jerome Powell should stay or go. We also have people potentially going just because it's travel season. Yes, exactly. And maybe not going because the economy is feeling a little iffy right now. And also our underrated story. Should I see or should I go? Astral travel edition. That will make sense later.  So Max, we got inflation numbers out this week. These are the numbers everyone's been watching, especially since tariffs have been in place for some months now. Are prices going up? Are they not going up? And the inflation report wasn't super extreme, but we are starting to see prices tick up for some of the more kind of tariff sensitive items, things like furniture and toys, which are very, very much, you know, from overseas.  Yeah, I don't want to delight in the struggles or potential struggles of the US economy, but I do feel like, Stacey, we got to say this is vindication for you, Stacey Vanek-Smith, and for anyone else who's been saying, which is pretty much every economist, that the tariffs were going to lead to this. And we've talked before on this show about how, why isn't it happening, is it because  inventories were pulled forward? Is it because of taco? And, you know, lo and behold, it does appear like it's starting. Although, like a lot of the stuff that had the biggest price increases are not affected by tariffs, like beef, like most of the beef that we eat is domestic. Like those prices are up like 10 percent. Barbecue season. That's the worst time for beef to go up. I know. This is exactly. Also, car rental prices ticked up. And Max, you were talking about this like yesterday.  Yeah, I'm planning a trip in the Midwest with a heavy road trip component, going to see some family on my wife's side, my mom, and renting a car. And oh man, it's like twice as expensive for this like basically week-long rental as I've ever paid and kind of staggering. One of many things I'd say in the economy that's kind of working against people taking trips and spending as much money on travel as they used to.  Yeah, I mean, because there are a lot of versions of this, right? I mean, even if you do have to take the vacation, or you're going to see family or something, you might scale back. Or you might splurge at this moment, thinking things are going to get more expensive. So I thought I would go and see what other people were doing, if they're splurging, if they're cutting back, how they're kind of feeling about the economy right now. So I went down to Union Square here in New York. It's a crossroads of sorts. We've got a lot of tourists, but a lot of locals, a lot of trains come and go from there.  and I asked people what their travel plans are. Do you have any plans this summer? Yes, I will be heading to North Carolina for my mom's birthday. The economy's kind of in a weird place right now. Is that factoring into your plans at all? Money does factor in. All the travel I've done recently has been a little bit more local, like a beach day with friends that's like a two-hour drive away and not like a plane ride away.  I travel a little bit for work. I work on film sets. But no, in general, I have no plans to get on a plane for quite some time. And it is because of money. Do you guys have travel plans this summer? I don't like to travel during the summer because it's too expensive, too hot, and there are children everywhere. October is the best time to travel. Do you have any plans to travel this October?  I think I'm going to either go to Croatia or Costa Rica. A lot of it is if I can get days off. Part of it is do I find a good deal? Also, where is the dollar strong? Where's the dollar strong right now? Japan still seems like a pretty good deal. Do you like track this?  Oh, I, yeah. New York is full of some really interesting people.

We've had Trump kind of questioning if Powell should go. Yeah, it's like an episode of The Apprentice. It's like he's going to fire him one minute, then he's going to keep him the next minute and and on and on.  I mean, just to paint a small picture on Wednesday, we're recording this on Thursday. So yesterday here at Bloomberg at about 11 in the morning, there was this headline that read Trump likely to fire Powell soon, White House official says. And an hour later, an hour later, there was a headline that said Trump now says firing Powell unlikely, whipsawing markets."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 401.538, "text": " He's a terrible, he's a terrible fed chair.

And, you know, we should say clearly, Max, you know, Trump appointed Powell to his first term in 2017. Powell was nominated to a second term during the Biden presidency. So Biden was in the mix, too. But also, Trump does not technically have the power to fire Powell, right?  Yeah, a lot going on here. And I think the way that this would happen if Powell were to get fired would be around there's this investigation going on into a renovation and alleged overspending by the Fed in renovating its headquarters. Feels really like a pretextual thing, like they're trying to gin something up. But that is how it would happen. And Trump has indicated, you know, later in the day, he said, I wouldn't fire him unless there were some kind of fraud. That seems like a reference to this investigation.  Right. But but the sort of the immediate issue, I think, that Trump is really upset about is interest rates. He wants Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Yeah. And, you know, when this original headline happened where where the White House official told us, told Bloomberg that they were going to fire Powell quickly, like I heard like a gasp in the newsroom. I mean, people people reacted to that just because it's it's so  It is such a break from precedent. And also, I think everyone knows, because all of us kind of are living with the financial markets, that would affect the markets, that the markets were going to take a dive when that happened.  Oh, yeah. I mean, I think, you know, the independence of the Federal Reserve, the central bank and the ability for that entity to make decisions that are kind of independent of politics or popularity, at least traditionally, that has been looked at as quite sacrosanct and quite crucially important. And now I do feel like that is kind of being thrown into question.  But we wanted to bring an expert on to talk about this issue, why it's important, why it's being questioned right now. And so we've got economist Martha Gimbel here. She is the executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale. Hey, Martha. Thank you for having me. So there's all this back and forth, all this drama about, you know, Trump wanting to potentially fire Jerome Powell. Will you talk to us a little bit just about why? Like, what's going on here on the surface?  So I think one thing to keep in mind is that President Trump likes lower interest rates. In fairness to him, lower interest rates are really fun. You get to borrow money more cheaply. That flows through to mortgages and consumer credit. And businesses. Businesses expand. They hire. That's good. Yeah. Everybody wants that. The fact that it's fun when interest rates are low is exactly why we have an independent central bank.  Because if it were just up to politicians, generally what you see is they try to keep interest rates low because people like that. And then inflation can get out of control.  And so historically, policymakers have kind of tied to their own hands and pre-committed to say, hey, we won't be touching the interest rate regime because we basically know that we are not trustworthy. We know that we will do something that in the short run makes voters happy, but in the long run can create economic instability and more inflation.  There seem like two questions here. One is about the independence of the Fed, which is like a big structural question. But then there's also like, should Jerome Powell lower interest rates right now? And it seems like there's room for disagreement there. Stacy and I, Martha, you were not here, but last week Stacy and I did an episode about consumer sentiment, talking about how there are these warning signs. Is the story that Trump's telling about the economy and like the desire for lower interest rates, apart from the kind of like,  badness of like the president publicly feuding with the chair of the Federal Reserve. Like, is there anything to the argument that like he is being too slow to react, maybe like too concerned about inflation, not concerned enough about the economy? So I do want to distinguish between the question of like, should the Fed be cutting more versus what President Trump has been talking about, which is like interest rates at one percent? That would be a really, really substantial cut. And no economist is talking about cutting interest rates that much at this particular point in time.  What are interest rates right now? About 4%. There's all of these things that the Fed is kind of trying to keep an eye on. It's trying to see if the labor market is starting to deteriorate. It's trying to see what is happening with the impact of tariffs on prices. And it's a really uncertain time. And I think it is legitimately unclear  Should the Fed cut rates by 25 basis points this year? Should it hold? Should it do 50? I mean, you could get an economist on here to defend each of those options. You could not get someone on here, I don't think, to defend cutting interest rates by 3 percentage points.  Can I ask, people have argued that the Fed should be more responsive to the concerns of normal people. And I do wonder, Martha, is there a- We're accountable too. Yeah. We've just lived through this period where there's been a massive growth in wealth inequality, where there are aspects of the economy that are  not working for a lot of people. It's why Trump keeps getting elected president. And even if you leave aside the mechanism by which this is happening, is there anything to the argument that it would be better if the Fed had less independence than it does today?  No. I think there's a couple of things to address there. One is, you know, the Federal Reserve has really blunt instruments. And they've talked about this before, right? The Fed is not there to address inequality. That's for a couple of reasons, right? One is they work best.  When they have really clear mandates, they're there to address unemployment, they're there to address inflation. You start inserting more things into that, it really complicates the picture for them. And it means that people will trust less, right, that they're going to address inflation or unemployment.  The second thing is it's a really blunt instrument, interest rates. And so you saw people talking about this with the housing market where, oh, if the Fed raises interest rates, it'll impact the housing market. It's like, yeah, but they need to address inflation, and that's the tool they have. You need Congress. You need fiscal policy.  to address a lot of these other issues. And I think part of the reason why you've seen this focus on the Fed is because Congress is so dysfunctional. And so people have gone like, oh, we can have the Fed do things. But then that undermines the very existence and point of the Fed, which is to be isolated and insulated from a lot of these conversations so that they can do their job.  One argument that I read that I did find kind of compelling was this idea that like, you know, inflation got really, I mean, not quite out of control, but it was almost in the double digits at one point. And I heard, you know, somebody say, like, well, President Biden lost his job. Jerome Powell didn't.  And I do think there is an interesting idea. I mean, the tradeoff of independence is that you're not necessarily held accountable for your actions. And maybe there's just not enough of a consequence if a body is independent. I mean, there are definitely advantages, but it does seem like there are real disadvantages, like you could make an argument for maybe a less independent bed.  Yeah. I mean, I think one thing that is hard is that consumers don't understand the way the Fed works. And so the thing that people often want in these situations is they want the means that will not achieve the end that they want. So as an example,  If you polled voters, one of the number one things that they thought should be done to address inflation was to lower interest rates. Totally understand why people think that, right? Like things are too expensive. Yeah. If you're trying to get a home loan, I mean, that's super expensive. Right. And like inflation makes things more expensive. If I pay lower interest, that's less expensive. So that will fight inflation. Right. Like you can cut. You see how people get there.  But of course, if you lower interest rates, you get exactly the opposite effect. And so I think this is one of the things that is really hard about the Fed, and I understand why it is frustrating, is it does feel like this kind of group of technocratic bureaucrats just kind of looking at their charts and doing their thing. The problem is that we now have decades of experience that tells us that a group of unelected bureaucrats looking at charts and doing their thing is actually the thing that gets you the best economic outcome.  And that is very frustrating. And I'm very happy that I'm the person that doesn't have to sell that concept to voters. But, you know, it's pretty clear from the economic literature that that is, in fact, what you want. You know, there's a chance, right, like we wake up tomorrow or even before this podcast comes out and Trump has tried to fire Jerome Powell.  What would happen? Like, what would be what would our world look like? So, first of all, you know, one, it would take time to get a new person confirmed, and that's even assuming there isn't legal action. First, it would almost certainly be counterproductive. Right. Because it's not the case that the Federal Reserve just, you know, is a  hand that sets the interest rates in every part of the market. It lends money to banks, for instance. But the mortgage companies figure out what makes sense for them to set interest rates at. And in a situation where you fire the Fed chair,  It is almost only the case that people are going to raise interest rates because they are going to feel more uncertain about the U.S. economy and the direction of interest rate policy in the United States. And so, in fact, what you would probably end up with is higher interest rates. Really? Yeah. It would actually almost certainly be counterproductive because people would just be so worried about lending money because they're like, what is happening in this country? This doesn't seem like a great time, so I will lend the money. But yikes, you're going to have to pay a lot to borrow.  Yeah, we want some extra money because your risk just went up, basically. Interesting. And so, you know, people who have been listening to this conversation who are thinking like, OK, I get that inflation might go up, but I really want to take out a mortgage. So, like, I'm willing to risk it. Like, let's fire a pal and see what happens. It would be highly unlikely that mortgage rates would go down in this instance.  The other thing to keep in mind is that we talk about the Federal Reserve Chair a lot. The Federal Reserve Chair does not have unilateral authority to raise or lower interest rates. They are the face of the Fed, but interest rates are set by a committee, and there's a wide range of views on that committee. It is not the case that if even someone was appointed tomorrow who was much more dovish on interest rates than Chair Powell is,  that you would see a huge change in interest rate policy. And in fact, you might see the committee going in the other direction because they might feel that in order to maintain their credibility on interest rates and to keep inflation expectations down, that they have to be even slower to cut. So there's a bunch of ways in which this could very, very well be counterproductive. As an economist looking at this,  like the prospect or basically the independence of the Fed being challenged and talked about in this way. How do you feel about this conversation and this issue coming up in this way? Is it like scary? Is it interesting? Is it how do you feel? I mean, this is the thing that stresses me out the most about the direction of the U.S. economy.  I think people should keep in mind when we talk about the stagflation of the 1970s and how hard that was. One of the things that people think played a really big difference there was that Arthur Burns, who was the head of the Fed, was not really independent. It was susceptible to a lot of pressure from President Nixon and that that made the situation worse. He kept cutting interest rates and inflation got pretty out of control into the double digits. Yeah. He was taking calls from Nixon who was saying, you know, don't do this. You need to  you know, keep money cheap, basically. And so I really do worry that we could end up in a situation like that again. I think you could end up with a real slowdown in economic growth. And again, at the end of this, I don't think that your mortgage or your credit card bill would be cheaper. Martha Gimbel is an economist and the executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale.  All right, Stacey, as we heard at the top of the show, it's the middle of the summer. It is travel season. And there's some amazing news in addition to all those plans we heard about earlier. Amazing news. Yeah. You don't have to take your shoes off when you go through the TSA line anymore. Donald Trump- Does that count as amazing news? Has achieved something that- It's a very low bar for amazing.  You don't have to take your shoes off. I am a TSA pre-check member. I never have to take off my shoes. All right. Well, for those of us who are not TSA pre-check members, the hoi polloi, you would think this would be great. And I've often heard people from other countries kind of complaining about our security measures, kind of like sort of snorting at them.  And you'd think as we move away from COVID that, you know, the tourist industry might be booming, but it is not, unfortunately. In the U.S.? Yeah, in the U.S. So we got the latest data from the U.S. National Tourism and Travel Office, which tracks this, reported that in June, the overseas international travel was actually down 3 percent from a year ago.  And which, OK, it doesn't sound that bad. But when you look at the big picture, we are still a long way from where we were during COVID. And given this, also given the way that the sort of political landscape is affecting travel, you know, of course, people in other countries are maybe not as inclined to go to the U.S. as they were before. I thought it'd be great if we brought in our friend Amanda Mull, Bloomberg Businessweek columnist. She is here. She's written a lot about travel and the decisions consumers make. Amanda, how you doing?  I'm doing great. So Amanda, the data that Max just laid out, I feel like you could look at it in a couple ways. One way is like, you know, wow, there have been a lot of rule changes for traveling from other countries. A lot of people might be kind of mad at us right now. And only 3 percent maybe seems not as big of a change as I might have expected. Or this could mean something else. What do you actually see in these visitor numbers?  This is one of those things where it's a lies, damn lies, and statistics type of thing, because what matters is the context you put those numbers in. So a 3% decline from last year doesn't feel apocalyptic for sure. But when you compare that to the pre-pandemic benchmark, and when you look at travel, you sort of have to look at how things were going in 2019, because the pandemic reordered travel plans for so many people in such a durable way.  We're still only about at 80% of the international tourist arrivals that we were at in 2019. So overall, this is a market that has already shrunk, and for it to continue to decline is bad. It means a lot of bad things for US tourism jobs. It means bad things for New York City, where we all are. And when you start breaking those numbers down further, you see some worrying indicators. The current projections are that  tourist arrivals for the U.S. are going to be down overall in 2025, up to 9 percent. So when you stack that on top of the existing decline post-pandemic, it's an industry that's taken a huge hit. You know, it's interesting because you think about people coming to the U.S. In a lot of ways, it says more about the economies of other countries than about our economy.  Although I guess the cost of the dollar or whatever does affect it. On the other hand, when you start digging into these numbers, you see some signs that the Trump factor may be playing a role. Canada, so in the June numbers that I just gave you, we don't have the information for land crossings or for Canadian and Mexican travel. But when you go back and look at the data we do have, which is as recently as April, it's down like 20%. So way, way more down.  Yeah, and Amanda's talking about these kind of like small communities. So you have the hotels, you have airlines, you have these big industries that are kind of heard across the board. But then there are a lot of towns in Maine and also upstate New York where you get a lot of Canadian tourism, also Florida for some reason. I guess Canadians love to go to Florida.  The other thing is it's probably worth mentioning and you see this in some of the analysis of this data is that it's kind of too early to know for sure where the international tourism is going because people plan vacations like way in advance. I have a trip to Italy planned for next year that I don't know honestly if I would have booked  if I were booking it now, partly because the dollar's gotten weaker and some other stuff. And so this may be a case where just like the tariff data that we talked about at the top of the show, where like we didn't see it at first, you could see it down the road as people are planning vacations of the future.  Yes, especially with tourist arrivals, you get this sort of lagging indicator thing that makes the numbers really frustrating for people to look at and understand. Even smart people who understand how this works and understand that sometimes effects take a while to show up in data have a really hard time looking at numbers three months or six months after an event that was supposed to change everything and thinking, it still looks normal. Was this wrong?  And because of the lag between when you plan and book a vacation for pleasure travel and when you actually go, I think that we will be seeing fallout from this for quite a while. Okay, I have a question for the both of you. So we're talking about the sort of post-COVID recovery. I want to get into that. But I was curious to ask you, how long do you think it took for travel to recover after 9-11?  Amanda, what do you think? I used to know this number. This number came up in some reporting I did for a story a couple years ago. And I think it was pretty short from my memory. I think it was like a couple of years, maybe less. Stacey?  I know our economy took like 10 years to recover. So I'm going to guess, even though Amanda knows all these things off the top of her head, I'm going to guess a little bit longer, like maybe seven years. OK. So it was kind of in the middle. July 2005 is when we hit the numbers we'd hit in August 2001.  So basically four years, which is kind of interesting because that's less time than it's taken us to recover from covid. And it sort of made me wonder, because on one hand, you think like 9-11 and especially for people who were adults at that point. Right. Just such a defining.  moment in history and culture and everything. And it was one where, like, air travel in particular was implicated, international travel. There were all these stories written about, oh, the world will never be the same. And yet, you know, we kind of returned to sort of the pre-9-11 travel norms pretty quickly. And it's taken us longer now. Like, we are further out from COVID than we were from 9-11, which seems interesting and different. And I'm not sure I would have necessarily intuited that.  Yeah, I think behaviorally, the sort of durable nature of COVID habit changes, people really took a break from flying for like a year or more. I think that that is like a big enough interruption to people's habits that like you're going to end up with more durable changes, even at the margins. Some people who just like don't want to fly anymore because they got out of the habit. And then you also have changes in business travel and business travel has never gotten quite back up to the rates it was before.  It was very lucrative, too, because they didn't really look at prices as much as the rest of us. They don't look at prices and they fly all the time. Yeah. And not all of this is about fear or about, hey, we don't live in a globalized world. It's about people get on Zoom calls for some percentage of meetings that they would have flown for. There is an underappreciated factor, which is related to this, that Amanda has written a lot about, which is that flying sucks now.  It's so bad. Is it worse than it was? Like, is it worse than it was before the pandemic? It depends who you are and how much you're paying to fly. If you are a person who, post-pandemic, has decided to treat yourself and get a fancy credit card that gives you reward smiles and puts you in line for upgrades and maybe incentivizes you to buy more expensive plane tickets to accrue those rewards faster,  then flying for you might be better now. You might spend more time in the airport lounges. A bunch of them have opened up since the pandemic. You might be sitting in nicer seats. For most people, I think it is worse. I think that travel has gotten a little bit more like riding the bus for a lot of people. For most people, for everybody in the back of the plane.  I think that temperatures run a little bit hotter as far as people's behavior. I think that we, there was like this real spate of like post-pandemic like sort of anti-sociality that I think has maintained its momentum in some cases in airplanes.  One thing that I keep thinking of just like sort of more holistically about international travel going down is I was on an earnings call once for the Empire State Building, like people that own the Empire State Building, and they were saying that travel was way down since the pandemic. And their solution, they're like, oh, but we've made up for the revenue by raising ticket prices. So it's like 80, 100 bucks now to get a ticket. Same dynamic, I think, basically. So I'm wondering if we see less travel, is that going to push prices up? Is that going to be contributing to inflation?  I think so, but it depends on what kind of travel destination or what kind of travel expense you're looking at. If nobody is buying airline tickets for pleasure travel, if nobody is renting cars to go on a fun road trip, then those will probably get less expensive to incentivize more people to start taking those up. That's what we saw during parts of the pandemic, which is, you know, come take the flight, go on the vacation, we'll get you there cheap. What it costs when you get there is none of our business.  But these sort of attraction tickets that are sort of limited that like once you're there, you don't want to skip it because it costs 20 more dollars than you thought it might. Those types of things, I think, are sort of ripe for inflation, ripe for price increases to make up for volume decreases. This is why the shoe thing is such a big deal, because a man is talking about how, you know, airline travel has become bad and everything. But maybe.  You do get kind of harassed. Maybe the shoe thing will save it. You think that is a move in the right direction. Yeah. I mean, I'm happy to keep my shoes on."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "Unidentified SPEAKER", "start": 1770.898, "text": "Same."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1774.353, "text": " So Max, we are now to the part of our show where we talk about a story that is underrated in the news, something that is very significant but isn't being talked about enough, and you brought today's story.

So, all right, Wall Street Journal reported on July 15th about a new trend in online commerce. I'm going to read you the headline.  Etsy witches charge for jobs. Sunshine and Knicks wins. Business is booming. So this is a story about how witchcraft and other sort of magical spells are super hot on Etsy. And I can tell you I went on Etsy and there are just like it seems like thousands of magical spells for sale. What does this mean? Like what do you do? How do you buy a spell?  You pay a witch, an online witch or warlock, I suppose, or other spiritual figure, like 20 bucks, 10 bucks, as little as a couple of bucks, depending on the spell. I guess it depends on what you want exactly. And I think that from there, they collect the money. But of course, they might- And they cast a spell on your behalf? They cast a spell on your behalf, yes.  Now what's funny here is, this is like technically banned by Etsy. They ban metaphysical services. What an incredible category name, first of all. Metaphysical services. Why do they ban metaphysical services? I have no idea, but I did notice that like all of these witches have disclaimers, essentially saying like- Also, do you want to mess with the witches and say that they can't sell their spells? Because that does not seem like a good idea. I mean, if the witches have cursed Etsy, that would explain some things about their-  Maybe we should short Etsy. They've messed with the witches. Amanda, do you know why people are doing this? It can't be totally fake. Like, you look at the reviews. These sellers have thousands of reviews. Obviously, there are ways to juice your numbers and everything. Are you a believer? Yeah. But it looks like there are people who are going for it. And there are some hilarious anecdotes in this Wall Street Journal story. The guy who  paid to have the Knicks win. They won one game, but then they lost the next game, and he said that it was probably some Pacers fans doing some counter spells, you know? Right, absolutely. You can't account for counter spells when you're paying the Etsy witch is the thing. They may have contracted with a better Etsy witch.  Well, initially, I was thinking, like, Stacey, you and I, because there are some spells that are relevant to everybody's business."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1914.485, "text": "Yes, what?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1915.066, "text": "There are lots of spells.

I feel like if Etsy's gonna crack down on anything, that's where they should start. But then there are also these kind of general ones, like here's a good one, 270 bucks, kind of pricey, but call to all 72 demons of the Gotia for a custom spell. So 72 demons, all, and according to the description, they're all gonna work at once together. Do you want demons? That feels dangerous. No. I've seen too many horror movies, don't mess with the demons. Yeah, didn't you ever watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer?  Yeah, well, I had the same feeling, because, like, you know, my kids are, you know, there are a lot of fairy tales and myths. Harry Potter. And there is a recurring theme, which is that don't mess with magical spells. You mess with a magical spell, like, it's going to blow back in a way you cannot appreciate. We cannot predict the nature of witchcraft. And as a result, I'm staying away.  I am about to reveal myself as too online, but this is a very long-standing digital market. This goes back, at least in the sort of current iteration, to Tumblr, as so many weird things online do. Tumblr witches that you could ask for a spell or you could like PayPal them or Venmo them for a spell have been going for a while, and I suspect a lot of these witch entrepreneurs have just moved their services over to Etsy to  You know, it gives you a checkout layer, some seller protections. I do also feel like there's this moment happening, like kind of like a mystical moment. I just feel like astrology, witchcraft, like this stuff is kind of coming to the fore.

We like other markets like Europe, but we don't want to abandon the United States of America. And I think it's fascinating to see how quick the recovery has actually been since April lows. S&P was down close to 20% at some point this year, and we're now making all-time highs again.  And I think the reason is because the markets and participants got more comfortable with AI story again. At the beginning of the year, there were loads of questions around AI, the deep seek, and all the money that has been invested into AI, if that leads to any side of returns. Now, when you look into the earning season that just happened in the first quarter, we actually got the confirmation that AI trade is still ongoing.  Companies continue to spend money despite the tariff uncertainty. And we're just one or two weeks before the earnings season again. And we just think that the tech companies and AI companies will continue to do well. And remember, U.S. market is predominantly tech driven. So the outlook on tech is very important."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 144.295, "text": " OK, so when you look at valuations, maybe I'm too valuation orientated, but when I look at the US, for example, we still have pretty much the most expensive valuations ever seen, apart from 2000, etc.  And you look at any valuation method, it doesn't matter what you look at, it's still close to historic highs. And every time you've seen valuations at this kind of level, you see returns in the following decade pretty weak.

We're in the camp that valuation can be between 20-21 times next 12 months price to earnings. And the reason for that is when you look into where tech is right now, in terms of the weighting, in terms of the net income, it's so much better and so much more important than it has been in the last 10-15 years.  The S&P market is predominantly driven by tech. And if you look underneath the sector, you basically have margins that are improving and you have the AI story. Now, I want to emphasize on AI story because AI doesn't just equal tech. The penetration of AI doubled over the last year or so. And what AI actually is, it means that some companies can become more efficient.  by efficient, meaning that their margin can actually be higher longer term. All of that actually deserves a higher valuation. So if you look into the CapEx intensity, those tech businesses are just less CapEx intense. Their margins continue to grow, they continue to invest into AI, and this is the reason why we're just comfortable with the multiple of where it is right now.  Again, fascinating to see. Valuation is back to 22 times as we speak, despite the worries around tariffs, despite the worries about where earnings will be this year. And I think the fundamental reason for that is tech."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 265.762, "text": " Another one of the conversations that we have over and over and over is at what point do profit margins in the U.S. revert to some kind of mean? Because again, you have historically high profit margins, and you might say, well, because of AI, because of this, because of that. But nonetheless, historically, these things do tend to revert to a bit of a mean. And when you see things at this level, what happens is maybe there's a different type of competition, or maybe there's a new series of regulations, et cetera, et cetera. Something usually comes in  to reduce margins when they hit this kind of peak, but you don't think that's going to happen this time. You see them continuing to expand."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 300.758, "text": "Well, I think it depends how quickly businesses adopt AI. Right now you have less than 10% of companies adopting AI. I think it's quite a low number compared to what benefits AI can actually bring to the business.  Now, if companies do embrace the AI adoption, that should lead to better margins overall. Now, if you're talking about more cyclical downturn, of course it can happen. Cyclical downturn can happen at any point in time, right? It may happen with tariffs, for example. We still don't know what tariffs will bring this year, right? We're still in the wait-to-see mode. For example, for this year, we are in the wider than expected range. We think that S&P earnings can be between plus two to plus nine.  because tariff uncertainty is still here.

Now, we're in the camp that we think that dollar will continue to depreciate. For example, we have a target of 120 by mid-2026 on Eurodollar. So that means that people need to start thinking, okay, how do I actually diversify my U.S. dollar portfolio?

And when, you know,  U.S. market continues to perform really well, but there are question marks around FX. And when other markets are also performing well, back to European domestic story that is happening right now, which wasn't the case, you know, even five years ago, when there is an interesting story here in Europe, then, you know, investors just start thinking about how much they actually want to have in the U.S. if there are alternative markets to that. This is one of the reasons.  The second one is talking, you know, in our outlook, one of the big themes was actually portfolio resilience. So traditionally, people have 60-40 in their portfolio, maybe adding different asset classes, different sources of risk and return to your portfolio makes sense. Infrastructure, gold, hedge funds. So there is a lot to talk about that rather than just having, you know, all exposure in the in the U.S. equity market."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 638.007, "text": " OK, well, let's go back to when I interrupted you five minutes ago, for which I apologize.

Is that right?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 651.17, "text": " That's correct. And it's interesting what is happening in Europe, because historically, and I would mean five, ten years, the way everyone looked into Europe was around, well, there is a very good stimulus and strong stimulus in China. Let's buy European equities because they're exposed to that market. Or the U.S. economy is growing and very strong. Europe has exposure to that market.  That is changing. What is happening in Europe right now is you're basically seeing a very strong fiscal stimulus coming from the German market. And just to put some numbers into that, 500 billion over the next 12 years, that is pretty substantial on the economy that is roughly 4 trillion. You compare that to the COVID package back in the US in 2021, similar size, but in a much larger economy. So the impact was smaller and it was quite unprecedented.  Not a lot of people were expecting, you know, something from the German economy, who is in general quite fiscally constrained. So that was surprise number one. And secondly, obviously, the security spending that is coming out of European countries, that is also quite unprecedented. So when you put two things together, you're seeing the growth in the European market that can potentially slightly narrow the gap with the US earnings growth.  Now, we don't think it completely closes. We just think that the gap narrows."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 24, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 737.312, "text": "OK.

When you look into the discount, Europe in general trades at around 20 to 30% discount to the US. Right now we're at 30%. And the reason is because one of the reasons is because we just don't simply have enough tech.  We have a lot of financials, we have a lot of industrials, whereas U.S. market is all about tech. So naturally, your sector composition is quite different, meaning that your valuation is different as well. Now, in terms of the growth, the growth is also quite different.  But the growth is just the matter of the sector composition that you have. Our tech sector is much smaller than in the US, and therefore our growth is smaller as well. But when we look into 2026 and 2027, so the next two years, we actually think that the growth can be between mid to high single digit.  Now, this year is a bit more uncertain because of the tariffs, but next year, a combination of German fiscal stimulus, security spending in Europe can actually lead to a bit better than average growth in Europe."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 26, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 813.556, "text": "OK, and when you look at Europe, which sectors are interesting?  there's a huge amount of money is going to be going into defense and one of the things that we've talked about again quite a lot here both in the US and across Europe is this changing nature of what defense means and we know when we talk in the UK about spending 5% of our  of our GDP on defense. No one knows where that money is going to come from, obviously, but let's say we somehow find that money. We know it's not actually going to go into, you know, tanks and guns. A lot of it is going to go into energy security and infrastructure, etc. So that's a changing dynamic. Is that a sector that you find interesting in Europe?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 27, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 854.632, "text": " We're like industrial sector, so industrial sector is exposed to a lot of different themes and structurally it is interesting. One of the big themes that industrials is actually exposed to is AI. So AI is a big topic and it's not just tech companies that are exposed to AI, it's also the industrial companies. The second thing is you have the fiscal spending in Germany.  So naturally, the companies that are the most exposed to that will actually be industrials. And we think that the impact is likely to come, I would say, from next year rather than this year. Again, this year is more tariff specific. And then, yes, defense spending is also increasing in Europe.  But overall, I would say when you look into the European story, the most interesting angle is actually the domestic companies. Because in the last decade or so, I would say the focus has been on the multinational companies that have exposure to the U.S., have exposure to Asia, but less exposure to Europe. And now it's changing. People want to have domestically oriented companies, either in the industrial sector, financial sector, construction, utilities.  Because again, the story is evolving here in the region, rather than everyone else. And on top of that, you basically have, if you're looking into the domestic oriented companies, you have more exposure domestically, but also less FX risk, which is quite important. Because you know, when euro dollar continues to rise, that is not great for some of the exporters. And secondly, you have less tariff risk."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 28, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 954.615, "text": "What about the consumer orientated companies or even the luxury good companies?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 29, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 959.746, "text": " I think the expectations for those companies are quite weak as we speak. I think they need to deliver better than expected results in the coming couple of quarters and especially show that the U.S. market continues to be strong.  And then there is a bit of a relief in the Chinese markets, which hasn't been the case for the last couple of years. I think the valuation is attractive for those markets, but there is a very kind of a big divergence between the losers and the winners in the space.

And frankly, this is one of the reasons why when we talk to investors, we highlight the power of, you know, diversifying beyond your 60-40 portfolio.  adding other asset classes that can do well if inflation picks up, for example, alternatives, for example, infrastructure, hedge funds, gold.

I always find Neil fascinating to listen to. He has a really great track record forecasting things in a way that is occasionally out of consensus. So when he's talking about inflation in 2021,  or Fed hikes in 2022, or why we weren't going to see a recession in that same year, it's always fascinating to see somebody whose thought process is detailed and interesting and out of consensus, but also right. I thought this conversation was fascinating, and I think you will also. With no further ado, my conversation with Head of Economic Research at RENMAC, Neil Dutta.

If you have a period of inflation, the model is going to assume that you need a recession in order to get it back to target. So I think at some level, one of the driving  One of the reasons driving the recession views on the street back in 2022 was because the Fed was basically telling you that's what they thought they needed to get inflation down. Now, by the end of 2022, I think it was becoming increasingly clear to me that we weren't going to have a recession. And again, I kind of put on my business economics hat, right? So if you go back to that period, we had the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That sent energy prices through the roof. By the end of the year,  gas prices had basically round tripped and the labor markets were strong. So we were going into 2023 with upward momentum and real incomes. Okay, so that's good. That should support consumer spending. Next, despite massive Fed hikes, like the Fed was going 75 bps a meeting, by the end of the year, what was going on with home building stocks?  they were actually turning around, right? Homebuilder sentiment was getting better, right? Builders were in a much better balance sheet position.

So housing was doing well despite hikes. You had governments spending a lot of money, like state and local governments were flush with cash, right? They got all this COVID money. So you had government spending.  And then everyone was primed for recession, right? I mean, it's like this expectations element of it. One of the ways I think recession happens is through surprise. If people think things are going to be OK and then they're not, then that prompts a clearing out of inventories and investment and so forth. But if the opposite's true, then that'll happen, right? So if everyone is primed for recession and it doesn't happen, then there's going to be a period where you have to kind of gear up  invest in inventories and hiring and so forth. And so based on those four factors, to me, it was like by the end of 2022, it's like, yeah, we're not going to have a recession. Real incomes are growing too rapidly in order for that to happen. And the housing market's doing well. If you can get that right, if housing is working in the US and labor markets and real incomes are growing, you're not getting a recession.  And so to me, it was a really easy market call because a lot of the weakness in the market was just predicated on recession risk.

Not all slowdowns end in recession, but we know that all recessions start with a slowdown. And it's pretty clear that the labor markets are slowing down. You have a very narrow kind of breadth of industries adding jobs. A lot of it is in kind of acyclical industries like education and health. So sort of the cyclical areas of the labor market are slowing down. You're seeing weakness in like white collar professional services.  Recruiting intensity is low. So the labor markets, I think, are, to me, that's been my big theme for this year, is that it's far more concerning than the consensus seems to appreciate. And I think also for the Fed. I mean, they keep talking about how the labor market is solid.  And to me, that's basically a very surface level analysis. They're looking at, okay, the unemployment rate is 4.1%, and therefore the labor markets are solid. But I think you can make a very strong case that the unemployment rate of 4.1% is really overstating the degree of health in the job market. When the unemployment rate is 4.1%, you typically don't see  like the hiring rate as low as it is. You don't see the quits rate as low as it is.

Since then, you've seen some stability in inflation. And now that the stock market's back to all-time highs, essentially, you've seen some recovery in consumer sentiment, not surprisingly.  But what I've been focusing on, there's this big debate about how useful survey measures of economic data are, like consumer sentiment, ISM, versus hard economic data, like manufacturing production, jobs growth. So to me, I think the bigger question for people in my field is how much do you want to weigh  survey measures of economic data in your process. And to me, there is still useful information in these surveys, right? So when you look at the conference board data, for example, it's another consumer confidence number. If you look at the labor differential, so what are consumers telling you about how plentiful jobs are? Are jobs hard to get or are they plentiful? That number still does a reasonably good job telling you or informing you about  like tightness in the job market. And if consumers are telling you that things are a little bit more slack, you should probably believe them. So to me, it's about looking at which pieces of survey data are important and which ones aren't. Even in regional manufacturing data, they ask the purchasing managers about their CapEx intentions.

Essentially, you have nominal GDP slowing and the Fed funds rate is not doing anything. It's basically flat at 4.5%. So to me, that represents a  a passive tightening of monetary policy, and that'll continue to build pressure on the economy, particularly on the labor market. So, you know, kind of go down the list, right? I do think that their left tail risk of the distribution has gone up. You know, number one, I mean, labor markets are cooling and income growth is slowing. That's probably going to weigh on consumer spending.  That was true even before tariffs came into force. If you look at housing, residential investment is probably slowing because home prices are now declining, particularly in the places where the builders are making the homes, right, which is like the South, Florida, Texas, Arizona. That's weighing on construction activity. If you look at  business investment, it's probably welcome that they just pass this tax law. That gives some certainty around the tax outlook. But at the same time, you know, some of that effect is going to be blunted by what's going on with trade. So you haven't really seen much in terms of, yeah, outside of AI, business investment has been quite sluggish.  And then you have state and local governments cutting back.

And we've been through four economic shocks in that period. The reason this one, the fourth one, is different to the first three is that it's primarily induced by policy, by decisions taken around tariffs. And so I think what that means for this type of multilateral engagement  is that people recognise here that at a time when there's lots of volatility, uncertainty and unpredictability, the best defence against that, the best antidote to that is more engagement, more resilient economies, more robust supply chains, more reliable markets for our exports.

That's a big part of the Australian agenda as well. But we're trying to de-risk these relationships without decoupling. And I think that's a major theme. It's a heartening theme because the alternative would be to pretend that at a time when these trade tensions are escalating and these conflicts in important parts of the world, to pretend that we can just retreat into our own corners.

That already represents  tens of billions of dollars in extra investment. It's a much higher trajectory than when we came to office three years ago. And so we are increasing our defence spending.

No major advanced economy has been able to, over the last three years, maintain that growth and have those inflation and employment outcomes.  And so why we're proud of that is we've made very substantial progress on inflation, now sustained progress on inflation. It's given our central bank the confidence to cut rates twice already this year. But we've done that without paying for it with much higher unemployment. Unemployment is now 4.3%, historically low, the lowest average unemployment over the last three years for any other  government in the last 50 years. We've created 1.1 million jobs and so our labour market's been a source of strength.

The old guard on Wall Street and the crypto punks are all delighted with the administration's plans for the financial sector so far, especially the big push on deregulation. That's no mean feat. There's little else these folks could agree on. But when the financial sector gets everything it's asked for, that's not always good news for the rest of us. In loosening the guardrails on the banks, or at least saying that's what it wants to do, and giving the presidential seal of approval to all kinds of crypto,  Is the administration laying the groundwork for the next big financial crisis?

Thank you."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 110.45, "text": "Thanks for having us."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 114.697, "text": " So Kitanga, we tend to come to the reporters first because they're the ones who are trying to kind of keep track of everything that's going on. When the administration came in, what would you say were their big priorities in thinking about the state of financial regulation in the US and the system that they were inheriting?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 131.521, "text": " On day one, Trump's regulators really wanted to focus on streamlining all regulatory and supervisory efforts to make sure that small banks, community banks, could compete and that bigger banks weren't necessarily complying with rules that were, as they say, goal-plated or much more onerous than the framers had anticipated.  Part of that focus was really to address things that didn't really address a bank's balance sheet. Things like climate rules, restricting access and partnerships with fintechs and non-banks, a heavier hand on anything tied to crypto. Trump's regulators came in thinking, how can we level the playing field for banks to compete, whether those were smaller banks and bigger banks, and let's pause anything that the Biden administration proposed.  and then revisit some of the bigger ticket items that addressed issues that actually affected their ability to lend, like capital, liquidity, and all the rest."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 186.793, "text": "Okay, so that's really useful. We've tended to think that the administration has acted extremely quickly on an enormous range of fronts in its first few months. If you think about those goals that you just set out, how are they doing? Have they made some big moves in those directions?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 200.692, "text": " On the one hand, initially, privately, you'd hear folks on Wall Street and even some in Washington would agree there are things the administration's doing that's not quite the main priority that included a flurry of executive orders that seem to get in the way of regulators getting to work. But to some degree, the personnel moves that we've seen at the agencies have really made a big difference in terms of their ability to get the deregulation agenda started. And chiefly,  at the Fed, the departure of Michael Barr, who as the vice chair of supervision under Biden was supposed to be in office until next year, his departure in a bid to sort of avoid a fight with Trump opened the way for Michelle Bowman, who's now the Fed's top bank cop, to come in and really take a look at, okay, what are the main issues that banks have said they want to see paused and what are things that we could begin to do around capital and  the major agenda item so far out of the Fed, and indeed all of the regulators, has been a major capital rule, this enhanced supplement to leverage ratio, which is the beginning of easing capital rules for banks. There are others that we expect, but already having a proposal with a 30-day comment period on that item, in addition to pausing other rules that sort of got in the way, has been in some ways ahead of track for the administration, again, because of Barr's departure."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 280.78, "text": " It's good you've taken us to the FED because I want to get onto that a bit later. I think we tend to focus a lot on what's going to happen to the chairmanship of the FED and thinking about Jay Powell and whether he's going to get fired and how much power that might get the president. But as you've reminded us, there's lots of people behind slightly less high profile things that the FED is deeply involved in, which the administration can have a lot of influence over, partly because of that personnel change you just  mentioned Michelle Bowman. So we'll get on to that in a bit. But Christine, after many years of very distinguished reporting in different areas, often in finance in Bloomberg, you're now on the editorial board. And so you're associated with the editorials. And I was quite struck by one on financial deregulation that was published soon after  President Trump was re-elected saying, this campaign's disdain for the administrative state and the public's growing exasperation with red tape suggests the country is in for a period of bureaucratic humility. Here's hoping the financial system doesn't become vulnerable as a result. Well, I think you got the bureaucratic humility right, but do you think overall that we're heading in a direction where the financial system will be less safe?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 352.617, "text": " Well, it's hard to say. I mean, but as Katanga was pointing out, personnel is really policy here. I mean, besides Michelle Bowman, who's been a very staunch opponent of many of the regulatory efforts under Biden, the Trump administration has named to all of the key regulatory posts people who are, you know, advocates for the industry in one way or another. I think even Michelle Bowman has named one of the top lobbyists for the banks as a key deputy.  So now there are people in position to rewrite or pause, in many cases, rules or enforcement actions that the industry didn't like. That's not always a bad thing. Some of the things that were happening under the Biden administration were just, you know, probably overaggressive. Gary Gensler had an incredible record at the SEC of writing and proposing rules far exceeding his predecessors.  And many of the rules he was proposing were not required by statute. So he was really going above and beyond. And that is all being dialed back pretty quickly. The people who are in place are just right now just trying to end anything that was happening under their predecessors. And as I said, some of that makes sense. For instance, these really onerous requirements on mergers between banks probably don't make that much sense. Bank mergers are in and of themselves not a bad thing. They can actually make the system safer sometimes.  That said, I mean, they basically gutted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which had done some pretty useful work in protecting consumers. And, you know, it remains to be seen how lowering capital requirements, as they're proposing, will affect the resilience of banks if things go wrong. And then they're dialing back some of the oversight that had been proposed over the sort of so-called shadow banking system, which poses its own set of potential dangers. I thought it was interesting just to make one point that the SEC  One of the commissioners who's still on the commission, who's a Republican, is Hester Pierce. She's so pro the cryptocurrency industry that she's known as Crypto Mom. But she actually put out a fascinating statement last week, pushing back at the effort to tokenize all the financial instruments. If you tokenize things, it doesn't magically change the underlying thing. You can't just avoid securities laws by tokenizing something.  So even people who are industry advocates are starting to see they need to push back a little bit against some of the excessive optimism of the people there."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 504.003, "text": " So just to touch into the weeds a little bit, one of the rules that has certainly been a little bit unpopular among some of the big banks is this supplemental ratio, which is supposed to be about maintaining the strength of the balance sheet of the bank and making sure that they can't be too highly leveraged. But there's a change in effective loosening in that, which the administration is very keen to achieve. Roughly, what is that aimed at doing, Katanga?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 532.808, "text": " Roughly, the regulators hope that by making changes to the ratio, to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, that trading in the $29 trillion Treasuries market, particularly in a moment of crisis, would be easier for the likes of JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. And by lowering that requirement for those banks, it would allow them and their subsidiaries to sort of have the same requirement"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 561.901, "text": " So Christine, I'm remembering in the first Trump administration, some of the constraints that were put on banks after the global financial crisis were pared back. And then it was suggested later that those changes had helped put us on a path to the bank failures we had a couple of years ago. I guess, you know, Silicon Valley Bank, Signature, First Republic. Do you have the same kind of worries about this effort to change the supplemental leverage ratio, or do you think it actually makes a bit of sense?"}, {"keywords": ["Apple"], "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 589.576, "text": " Well, I mean, it's certainly true that the size of the treasury market has grown dramatically since those rules were first proposed back in, I think, 2014. And so when they were proposed, there was supposed to be this limit on how many, you know, assets banks could have compared to their level of capital, even if those assets were super safe things like treasuries or central bank reserves.  So they wanted to make sure that there was a minimum sort of backstop, no matter what the riskiness of their assets was. But as this treasury market has grown, now the banks are constrained when things really develop from being able to just buy unlimited treasuries. And as a result, you've seen a lot of hedge funds and proprietary trading firms step in and do a lot more activity in the treasury market.  The problem is that if you lower that backstop, that sort of minimum capital requirement for banks, you're just reducing the safety that bank depositors and other investors have that if something goes wrong in the assets on the bank's balance sheet, that they'll have enough capital to deal with it.  So things just go wrong. They always do. And so as a result, it would make more sense, in my view, to have capital requirements where they are. It doesn't seem necessary to lower them. There are other ways you could solve the problems in the treasury market."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 666.936, "text": "It is funny. When you look at a bank balance sheet, there is this kind of basic fact that if it was any other business, you would say it was hugely bankrupt.  It's like they're the only institutions that are able to have a relatively small amount of equity and then they're lending a huge amount on the back of that, which you'd never be able to do if you were just a sort of normal company."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 685.623, "text": "Right. And that's by design. And that's one of the arguments that a lot of the private credit and non-bank companies are saying is that we have a different model where we have more permanent capital.  so there's no risk that depositors suddenly flee and you have a problem with, you know, trying to repay your lenders. But banks, you know, are always going to be leveraged, but making sure that they're not over leveraged is sort of the core part of the post-financial crisis regulation. And so any effort to sort of water that down seems concerning."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 715.953, "text": " Now Katanga, I think, I mean, Scott Besant, the Treasury Secretary, does seem to be one of the key movers in this financial deregulation or certainly to this push to change banking regulation. And of course, the Treasury Secretary has always had quite a lot of power in these areas. But I guess the way that the administration has concentrated power and gained a lot more influence over the independent agencies, you know, Supreme Court has kind of  given them the power to hire and fire many of these officials at independent agencies who we previously would have thought of as a bit more arm's length from the administration. Am I right in thinking that he has become a particularly important figure in this, and along with Michelle Bowman, is really giving the administration a much sort of clearer, unified policymaking than we might have had in previous eras?"}, {"keywords": ["Bessent"], "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 766.477, "text": " You're right, Stephanie. Bessant has really taken the helm of the financial regulators and said, let's coordinate our efforts by meeting with the heads of the three main bank regulators, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, and the Treasury's own Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Together, those three agencies are now trying to coordinate their efforts in streamlining rules, discussing the  sort of priorities around changes to capital."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 794.848, "text": "Call me suspicious, but I can't help noticing that Scott Besant, the Treasury Secretary, who's now going to be also presiding over a massive increase in the number of US treasuries. I mean, the debt is going to go up by several trillion dollars, at least according to almost everyone's forecast.  Is it a coincidence that he also wants to make it much easier for banks to hold treasuries, not worried too much about how many they own? Isn't that going to be on balance sort of positive for the market at a time when the cost of borrowing for government's been going up?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 823.191, "text": "Many people would agree that yes, on its face, it's interesting that Besson is playing that role and seemingly following some strategy that many others either haven't seen or haven't agreed on.  but what the impact will be will be rather interesting, and I imagine in a lot of ways people close to him privately must be discussing, hey, have you considered what the outcome will be by addressing things in this way on both sides."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 848.219, "text": " That's a very careful answer, which I would expect. I would expect no less. But lots of people would be amazed that we haven't talked about crypto yet. Christine, for people on the outside, that seems like the biggest sort of mood shift and change of direction for this administration when it comes to finance. I mean, that feels like the whole world of cryptocurrencies is being kind of welcomed into the American financial system in a way that was just not the case under the previous administration."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 876.62, "text": " That's absolutely true. And just to return to your previous point about the treasury market, one of the first things that the banking committee got to was the Genius Act, which is a way of creating a regulatory framework for what are known as stable coins. This is a part of the crypto market that basically just is a digital version of the dollar, let's say.  And part of the regulatory regime will require them to own safe assets, like in particularly treasuries. And there's an argument that this will increase demand for treasuries and help the dollar and whatnot. And so you're building sort of a whole financial structure that's even more leveraged on treasury market, so stable coins and banks, as you've talked about, at a time when the treasury market maybe is becoming a little less  reliable, as you just saw a downgrade from the third of the three big rating agencies, that maybe should be a cause for some concern. But otherwise, crypto in general, sort of the irony is it's being boosted by regulation because they were the least regulated thing that existed and they could do whatever they wanted and it turned out that was not good for the crypto industry because they went too far and they stole too much money and  people lost their life savings and got scammed and got defrauded and there were a lot of problems. And so now they're writing rules to make people feel comfortable about the crypto industry. And it's interesting that these are rules that were essentially very similar to what Sam Bankman-Fried was proposing back when he was on the Hill, you know, asking for regulation by the Commodity and Futures  Right, before his company blew up. Yeah, before he went to jail. So, you know, and Trump himself was a big skeptic of crypto back in the day, kind of in the same vein as Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett. But now he's in the business, so he's a proponent. So, yeah, everything seems to be designed on Capitol Hill to do whatever they can to help the crypto industry. And, you know, there's, I think, a genuinely large degree of risk in that.  you know, the volatility of these assets, they're just not, they don't have the tradition of risk management that the sort of, you know, more established banking and financial system have. So there's a lot more volatility and there's no fundamental value in a lot of these sort of meme coins or different tokens. I mean, stable coins are different, obviously.  But even stablecoins, it's going to be a lot of tech companies starting these. One way of thinking of it is you sort of had banks that were becoming more technologically focused, and now you're having tech companies that are becoming more bank-focused. And which do you feel safer putting your money in? It's a real question. The risk is that we're having a bubble, which is very possible. We had one in 2022.  that popped, and then if it all turns around, then you have a big, you know, and the more the traditional financial system is connected to it, the more risk you have for the broader economy and people who aren't connected to crypto."}, {"keywords": ["Apple"], "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1062.97, "text": " Katanga, weren't there some limits that were put on the banks to prevent them having too much exposure to crypto and the administration has been talking about pairing those back, is that right?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1075.407, "text": " So Trump's regulators have indeed sort of reversed those guardrails that were put in place following the 2022 issues in the industry. But since then, they've tried to underscore the importance of banks that are holding crypto custody, as recently as this month, saying banks really should bear in mind that the onus is on those institutions for any tie-ups they have with crypto firms to make sure that they disclose adequately and spell out for their customers what the risks are, which is commonplace, right? That's an expectation."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 24, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1104.078, "text": " We saw that really work very well in 2008, just to be careful, just make sure you know the risks on your balance sheet. If you were one of the big banks, there has to be something a little bit alarming about this zeal to have this whole new form of finance that really, although it's somewhat regulated now,  makes a virtue of not being very transparent, of being difficult to track and somewhat outside the traditional system. You have the Peter Thiels of this world and others, they actively want to, you would say disintermediate, you know, bring the finance outside of traditional banks. It is a threat to the sort of traditional financial system ultimately and its administration seems to be all in favor."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 25, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1148.527, "text": " Well, I mean, in two ways. So I would say one thing that's been a rallying cry among Republicans this year has been this claim that the big banks were debanking, meaning denying banking services to crypto related companies just on the basis of sort of reputation or not liking them and that this was a wrong thing and that it had to be stopped.  And so, you know, there was put in place a change so that, you know, regulators couldn't consider reputation risk when they're assessing banks. Banks have a lot of reasons why they legitimately had to have concerns about banking with these crypto companies. One of them is just how onerous it is to do the anti-money laundering checks.  This is a system that's designed to get around the regulated financial system. It has been used by criminal and illicit funds. So now they're almost being pushed that you have to bank crypto. If you're not, you're somehow debanking. You're doing this illegal and sort of almost like a First Amendment kind of thing.  On the other front, there is this real concern that some of the rules that have traditionally applied to the financial sector, like the U.S. has always had this concept of a separation of commerce and banking. In other words, we don't want Walmart to also be a bank because then somehow they're going to, you know, prioritize their suppliers and their customers over their competitors.  stable coins are going to be allowed to be issued by a lot of tech companies, or at least the private tech companies. And so, you know, this is sort of these traditional rules are just being scrapped in the interest of helping the sort of crypto industry. And so, yeah, I think for the big banks and for little banks, it's sort of a concerning development."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 26, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1253.877, "text": "Katanga, is there a concern in Washington that the financial system is going to be a bit hard to control as a result of this?

There's concern about all together that spells potential trouble, but they'd say it's too soon to say whether a crisis is imminent or not.

We're going to begin this morning with the increasing pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The president posted on social media last night that he's directed his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to produce what he calls pertinent testimony tied to the Epstein case. Earlier on Thursday, the White House said it would not appoint a special counsel to review the case.  you  In a new development here, the Wall Street Journal has published a story. It says that more than two decades ago, President Trump wrote a letter to Jeffrey Epstein that reportedly included an outline of a naked woman and a Donald signature. This was part of a bunch of letters for a birthday. The president has denied writing the letter, calling it fake and threatening to sue the paper. The journal story says that Mr. Trump was asked to contribute to this collection of letters that Epstein's then confidant Ghislaine Maxwell was planning to give to Epstein for that birthday.  NBC News has not independently verified that or seen the letter. Meanwhile, we're also learning more about the president's medical diagnosis. He has a condition that causes blood to pool in his legs. The White House addressed the condition yesterday during its press briefing.  This concern was thoroughly evaluated by the White House Medical Unit. The President underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency. Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.  We'll have much more ahead this hour on President Trump's medical diagnosis, as well as that latest victory in Congress. But let's begin with NBC News White House correspondent Vaughn Hilliard. We're going to start with the latest in the Epstein controversy. Vaughn, good morning. So first, let's start with this Wall Street Journal article. It was published last night. This is this letter, they say, President Trump allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. In a phone interview with the journal, the president denied writing that letter. We know he's also threatening legal action in response, something we've seen him do before, of course, to press. What more can you tell us?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 216.082, "text": " Right. This is a president that has a deep history of denials. He says that this letter was not written by him, and the caricature of the woman's body that is described in this Wall Street Journal story was not drawn by him. The Wall Street Journal moved forward with the publication of this, despite, as they say, on Tuesday night, they talked directly with the president, who threatened to sue them if they moved forward with publishing their reporting here.  The Wall Street Journal is outlining not criminal activity by the president, to be clear, but suggesting that, as part of the files that the Department of Justice has, as it pertains to its longstanding investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, that there are files that had not been publicly made available at this point in time that pertain to the now president.  At the same time, the Department of Justice has made it clear that they had released previously all information that was relevant, would they say, to any criminal investigations. That is longstanding practice to not release evidence that does not directly implicate anybody in a direct indictment. And so, there is a question here moving forward.  as to what other references there may be in files related to the president who had a lengthy relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. But again, it's a question of what may amount to just simply evidence of a relationship, but that is not any\u2014that would not contribute to any allegation of criminal wrongdoing by the president."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 313.383, "text": " Von, the president said, though, he's not planning to appoint a special counsel to review the Epstein case.

The legal obstacles are not wanting to taint anybody who, again, the Department of Justice did not seek to bring criminal charges against, that there may be individuals that provided witness testimony that was unable to be corroborated that DOJ prosecutors ultimately decided not bring charges against because they didn't have a body of evidence that they found that would amount to\u2014worthy of criminal charges. And, of course,  The DOJ and the FBI have outlined that there were more than 1,000 victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and there are sensitive details that have been redacted about Jeffrey Epstein's dealings and relationships, not wanting to reveal the identities of those victims or difficult details from the evidence that was gathered.  These are not just grand jury testimony, which Pam Bondi, the attorney general, indicated last night at the request of the president. She will seek to unseal and release. But this is a question also of other records that may be on hand here. And, of course, this is all part of now many years in the making, an effort by those particularly on the right, allies of the president, to have more records of Jeffrey Epstein involved.  but not under the scope that the president, President Trump, would be implicated in any of this.

But at the same time, this is acknowledged by the White House after the questions about these images here came out, Savannah."}, {"keywords": ["Tariffs"], "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 512.272, "text": " All right, Vaughn Hilliard, thank you so much for joining us on this, covering a lot for us this morning. Let's bring in NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel on this. Dr. Patel, good morning. So this is being called a common condition, especially for someone of the president's age. A lot of people, though, might not have heard of this chronic venous insufficiency. First, just explain what it is, if you don't mind. Vaughn did a good job, showed those pictures, kind of like what it can present as. But what exactly is going on in the body?  The van and he did indeed. It is a chronic common condition. About one in 20 Americans actually have this diagnosis especially after the age of 50. And what it really involves are the veins. The veins are the big pipes in your body that bring blood back to your heart. And because of gravity the way we sit the way we stand they have these valves that are pretty tough that go one way always to bring the blood back to your heart over time.  and associated especially with obesity, high blood pressure and some other common metabolic conditions, those valves can become very weak and blood can unfortunately go the reverse direction and pool. That's why you see that swelling around the legs and ankles. Again, very common and a chronic progressive condition. And what's the treatment for this? How does it impact someone's life?  Right. So the treatment depends on the stages. Let's just assume just based on what the president's physician reported in the pictures that we have that this is probably in the early to moderate stages. This is right at the time where you would do very conservative therapy things like compression stockings. Normally I would tell patients to try to elevate their legs and then to try to ambulate not to sit for prolonged periods of time.  Try telling that to an active president. So in addition to this he might be evaluated. There are medical interventions everything from over from prescription pharmaceutical drugs all the way to more intensive therapies that can be done laser therapy surgeries. But it doesn't seem like the president's condition is advanced enough to merit that. But treatment options abound.  I want to ask you also about those bruises on the president's hand that have been seen, and then also those questions that Vaughn had just mentioned there about makeup, that it looked like was covering them. Again, the president's 79 years old. I think people have seen those types of markings on the back of somebody who's a little bit older's hand. But is this related? Does that seem serious?  No, the two are unlikely related. And by the way, anybody over the age of about 60 who's ever had an IV in their hand isn't exactly what their hands look like. And it can last, by the way, bruising can last for weeks. And so hard to know kind of what exactly caused it. Certainly taking a low dose of aspirin, as they expressed the president is doing, can certainly make that worse. But it is something that overall isn't shocking, but not related to the venous insufficiency.  And doctor, does any of these things, the venous insufficiency, what we were just discussing with the hands, does any of it make you kind of like concerned the bigger picture of the president's health overall, or does this seem kind of unsurprising to you given his age? So the bigger picture is overall not concerning. The fact that he has chronic venous insufficiency does not automatically correlate to something life-threatening like sudden cardiovascular disease. However, given his age, given the fact that we know between weight, age, lifestyle,  that none of this is shocking and I would just say that these are all things that if this were any patient of mine with the exact same conditions would merit kind of lifestyle changes. Again, how do you do that as the President of the United States? I do think that it would be nice to see more complete records with the numbers with some of these kind of underlying metabolic assumptions that the President's physician just put in kind of a shorter statement. I think that would reassure everybody and also give us a little bit more of a picture into  what is likely a normal aging process for a 79-year-old. But again, these are things that should be monitored. They can lead to more serious conditions, and we'll just be watching over time.  Dr. Patel, really good insight. Thank you so much. Well, in a victory for the president on Capitol Hill, the House passed legislation requested by Mr. Trump to rescind funding for foreign aid and also public broadcasting. So House Republicans approved this bill. It actually caused back a total of $9 billion. It includes about $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. That is what funds NPR and PBS.  The other $8 billion there comes from cuts to foreign aid, and the bill now heads to President Trump's desk. We have NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Julie Serkin. Here's the twist, though. She's in studio with us. Julie, good morning. Great to have you here in New York with us. So first, just walk us through how this bill passed and talk about the impact of what is being cut here.  Yeah, Savannah, so good to be in studio with you. There was a very late night on Capitol Hill. I was not there. I was traveling here. But our colleagues covered this vote. And we keep getting used to these late nights on the Hill because President Trump is putting so much pressure on Republicans to get his agenda done. So what this package does is exactly what you laid out. Congress appropriates funds. They have the power of the purse. In this very unusual case, the president and the executive branch asked them to essentially claw that money back, to undo the money they already appropriated.  So now you have these $9 billion in cuts for foreign aid programs with the WHO, the USAID, the UN. PEPFAR, though, was saved from this program. About $400 million, Republicans told the president they're not going to agree to cut. And that was, of course, signed into law by President Bush in 2003 and had tremendous success. But there are still real concerns about the cuts Congress did make in this package. Two Republicans voted against it in both the Senate and the House, Savannah.  And this is not the last package that the president's going to request Congress to cut. And remind everyone what PEPFAR is and why we think that survived. So PEPFAR is the program that protected millions from contracting HIV and AIDS. It protected the kids and the children of people who had it.  And this was such a successful program, it is actually billed as the most successful global health program ever. And we already saw some controversy surrounding it with the Republicans in Congress delaying approving the funds for it because of some abortion concerns, especially in Africa. And so now you have this situation where some Republicans push back successfully to save it. But again, this is not the end of the road for these rescissions. The administration is going to keep asking Congress to do more to try and cut into some of the deficits they say we have.  such  I actually had to look up on my screen when I saw Cory Booker speaking and Chuck Grassley, the top Republican, talking over him. Democrats really tried to slow walk the nomination of Emil Bovey. He's somebody who's been close to the president. He was his defender in court during some of his prosecutions, especially in New York. And so he is somebody the Democrats said is not qualified for this job. He's somebody who whistleblowers allege.  told the president and the administration to ignore court orders, and Democrats had big concerns. Republicans pushed ahead with the votes anyway. Booker was talking over Grassley while the votes were happening. Democrats walked out of the room. There were some questions whether the votes were approved in committee, since Democrats weren't in there. But the full Senate is going to vote on his nomination, and Republicans are in control, so it's probably going to pass. One other thing I want to ask you about, especially because I think there could be some headlines coming out of this, NBC News is learning that Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan is expected to be  Deposed today. This is part though of a much broader lawsuit It alleges that he failed to protect wrestlers from a sexual predator when he was a coach at Ohio State University Jordan though is not the target of this lawsuit But it is the first time that he's gonna be answering questions under oath about it. What can you tell us about this? What are we hearing from Jordan? And what exactly is his piece of this puzzle?  So way before he got into politics, I know you probably know him from being that gangbuster kind of defender for the president on the Hill. He's very aggressive when he chairs hearings. He's a chairman of powerful committees, including the Judiciary Committee in the House currently. And so in this situation, Jordan is not a defendant in this case, but he is going to take the stand. He used to be a wrestling coach decades ago, in the late 80s, early 90s, at Ohio State University. And there's a situation where wrestlers there,  non-athletes and students, by the way. Athletes and students alike are concerned about these allegations of sexual abuse that happen at the school, particularly to these wrestling students, students who were wrestling at the school. And Jordan, for his part, a spokesperson, says, as everyone knows, Chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse. And if he had, he would have dealt with it. Jordan has always said that he was not aware  that any abuse was going on. Again, he's not in trouble here in terms of being named as a defendant, but he's definitely somebody they have questions for. I assume Jordan is going to stick to that line, though. All right. Julie Serkin, thanks. Great to have you here in New York with us. Thank you.  The federal judge is considering an unusual recommendation from the Justice Department. Prosecutors want a one-day sentence for former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison. He was convicted of violating the civil rights of Breonna Taylor during the botched raid that led to her death in 2020. NBC News Justice reporter Ryan Riley has more on this. And a warning, some of the images you see may be disturbing.  The Justice Department essentially wants no prison time for a conviction that could carry up to life in prison, instead asking for just one day for the only person convicted after firing shots into the home of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor. Taylor, an EMT from Louisville killed by police. After a controversial 2020 no-knock warrant that's since become illegal in her home state of Kentucky, her death becoming a national outrage.  amplifying a call to action at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. Two former Louisville Police Department officers who fired the shots that hit and killed Taylor never faced charges.

In a new sentencing memo, the Justice Department cites that fact in asking for a one-day sentence, saying there is, quote, no need for a prison sentence to protect the public from the defendant, adding that the federal conviction will ensure Hankinson never serves as a law enforcement officer again and will also likely ensure that he never legally possesses a firearm again."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1143.785, "text": " That memo, submitted by the head of DOJ's Civil Rights Division, initially established by Congress to protect the rights of Black Americans during the Civil Rights era, but has seen a wave of resignations during the Trump administration."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1155.657, "text": "And it's now prioritizing alleged violation of Second Amendment gun rights, transgender policies, and anti-Semitism on college campuses, according to internal memos obtained by NBC News in April.

Our thanks to Ryan Reilly for that report. Well, sentencing in this case is expected to happen on Monday. Well, this summer, does it not just seem like we have had wave after wave of severe weather, and today's no different. Along the Gulf Coast, the threat from that tropical disturbance, we had our eye on this yesterday. What was downgraded today, but we have still been seeing heavy downpours in parts of the South and the Midwest, and it's triggering flooding in places like Kansas City, Missouri. That's what you're seeing right here on your screen. This is from yesterday, these wet conditions  could also continue into the weekend. And this comes as millions of Americans are then feeling the heat today with temperatures soaring across parts of the country. NBC News correspondent George Solis has the latest from waterlogged Louisiana.  Good morning residents here in New Orleans and surrounding region. Breathing a sigh of relief that the tropical moisture that was expected to dump inches and inches of rain was not more severe. That's not to say that some communities did not get hit with several inches of water. In fact, one or two just west of the city here in New Orleans did see some significant flooding. Maybe four, five, six inches. Residents we spoke with say  Look, we're expecting this to recede fairly quickly, but the water did linger a little bit longer than they would have liked. Now, moving into the weekend, it's still going to be soggy and hot for millions. And unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Yesterday, we also were able to speak with a survivor of that lightning strike in New Jersey who says, fortunately, he does not remember anything, but he did know that victim that passed away. It was very traumatic for him. He's hoping to be home now, recovering from first-degree burns.  Again, back here in New Orleans and surrounding region, they are still looking at the potential of some more rain this weekend. So not completely out of the woods, but again, looking around at some of the wet streets here, they're just grateful the flooding here is not more severe.  back to you. George, thank you so much. Well now let's turn to NBC meteorologist Angie Lassman for the latest on that heavy rain and the flood risks in the south and the mid Atlantic. Angie, good morning. Hi Savannah, good morning to you. We head into the weekend with more severe potential when it comes to strong storms as well as flooding threats.  So here's the lay of the land right now. Notice these scattered storms that are, yes, across parts of the South. We've got a bit in the plains, some of that working across the Ohio Valley. And these are just some locations that we're expecting to see potentially some flooded streets and maybe some stronger storms develop. Right now, 17 million people under these flood alerts stretching from the coast back towards Kentucky. We've got parts of the central Gulf Coast still under these alerts as well.  And these are going to last through the day today as we gear up for additional rainfall on those already saturated ground. So across parts of the South, the Gulf Coast specifically, that's where you'll see the potential for more of that localized flooding that you just heard George talking about. But the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Southeast are also going to get in on those downpours as well. So we'll see some localized flooding there. Tomorrow, looking ahead to your Saturday, it's the Great Lakes and parts of the Midwest that we'll see dealing with the potential for some of those showers and thunderstorms.  Today, the flash flood risk we're most concerned about is centered across the mid-Atlantic. We've got really saturated grounds from those recent rains, and we've got the potential to see some pretty good rainfall rates throughout the day per hour. So we could see up to three inches per hour. That's a potential just west of Washington, D.C. So heads up for that. This will be something you deal with through the day today.  And on top of that, the chance for some stronger storms. We've got all the impacts on the table today for 9 million people. And tomorrow, an even larger chunk of the country is going to deal with those. 41 million people stretching from New York to Iowa, including Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis, all have the chance to see some of those stronger storms. Savannah, so it'll be another weekend where you'll want to have a way to get those weather alerts because, again, lots on the table. Such a good point and an important one after what we've seen happen lately. Angie, thank you so much.  Well, we're learning new details in a shocking murder that rocked a small town in May earlier this month. Yesterday, police arrested a teenager in connection with the homicide of a 48-year-old paddleboarder whose body was found at the water's edge. NBC News correspondent Erin McLaughlin has the latest on the details on the arrest.  A shocking development in the killing of Sunshine Stewart. A 17-year-old male is now in custody in connection with her homicide. The much-loved local was found dead near a campsite in the quiet town of Union, Maine. Police also confirming the 48-year-old was killed by strangulation and blunt force trauma. The news, leaving close friend Chloe Keller stunned. That's inconceivable. I can't imagine being that age and making that choice to harm another human being.  Police say the 17-year-old was arrested without incident in Union late last night. They've yet to release his identity, pointing to his status as a minor, saying in a statement that the teen has been transported to a youth development center in South Portland.  According to police, Stewart's body was located during a search of Crawford Pond on July 3rd, last seen paddleboarding the evening before. A public safety official told local newspaper Midcoast Villager, Stewart's paddleboard was found by drone on an island called 100 Acre. Her body was next to it where the water met the shore. When a community that's been safe for time immemorial has its innocence robbed of it, it does shake the foundation of comfort and safety.  What do you want to see happen next? I think everyone, all of us who knew and loved her need to gather and be together and celebrate her. She was beloved, profoundly beloved by everyone I knew who knew her. Erin McLaughlin, NBC News.  Well, next week, Brian Koberger will be sentenced for the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students after pleading guilty. In anticipation of that, Judge Stephen Hipler has lifted a sweeping gag order in the case that just happened yesterday. The order banned police, prosecutors, and witnesses from speaking out about the case that captured national attention for two and a half years.  Well, the plea deal shields Koberger from the death penalty. NBC News legal analyst Danny Savalas joins us now with more on this. Danny, good morning. So let's start just with more on what lifting this gag order ultimately means. What does it open up in the case? What might we hear?  Here's what it opens up and here's what it doesn't open up. The gang order prevented litigants from speaking about the case and people associated with them. So now presumably if those people want to speak they can. What it didn't address is something separate but related the sealing of documents.  And there are probably hundreds of documents in the court file that are sealed. The judge is still going to go through those and determine which of them will be unsealed. And that means basically available to the public in the courthouse. Some may remain sealed due to privacy reasons. But in all likelihood many of those will be unsealed because the default rule  Courts are supposed to be public. Sealing is supposed to be the exception, not the rule. So the only thing the gag order does is prevent people from speaking. That's been lifted because there's no chance of tainting any jury, because there never will be a jury. And Danny, what might the judge decide to keep sealed? Why would he make that decision?  I would imagine something that is especially private or something that might be under the statutory grounds for sealing, which generally relate to things like privacy or something that is very harmful, it would have to be\u2014you know, I'd have to see the documents or get an idea. But so many have been sealed, and in my personal view, probably too many, even though this is such a gruesome, tragic case.  I would expect this is a second judge now looking at the ceiling. I expect there's going to be a lot of documents unsealed and probably there's going to be only a minority that may remain sealed.  Danny, I'm wondering, you imagine that prior to had this actually gone to trial, it may be good for Koberger's case that some of this stays sealed, it stays away from public attention. But then I'm also thinking that now, that this is the outcome that we're seeing here, that he's taking this plea deal for the families. Do they want more information out there? Do they want to be reliving what happened to their children? Because it's, of course, going to become national conversation if there is anything new in any of this that comes out.  What do you take away from that? Who does this sort of help? Who does this hurt? And what might we hear in the coming days? One of the things this case highlights is that it's long been the rule that families of victims and victims themselves do not control litigation. They can be heard. They have a statutory right to be heard in many states and under some federal laws, but they don't control what the judge does with things like very private or very damaging or  hurtful or tragic information that's contained in sealed court files. So while they may be heard, they ultimately cannot control. And this case is a great example because you have families of victims who have very divergent views on things like the level to which Kogelberger should have gone to trial or the level to which documents should be made public. Danny, we're just a few days away from Kogelberger's sentencing. What can we expect there?  Virtually nothing in terms of varying from the sentencing. It's pretty much etched in stone. He's going to get multiple consecutive life sentences and then an additional 10 years for the burglary. There appears to be little change. The judge could theoretically vary from that, but probably will not. This will be more important.  for the opportunity for the victims' families to be heard. And they have not only a statutory right to be heard in Idaho, but a constitutional, state constitutional right to be heard. So I expect we will be hearing from those families, and it will be a very sad day for all.  We've got surprising news to tell you about this coming out of CBS this morning. The late show with Stephen Colbert is being canceled, ending its run in May of next year. Colbert made the announcement at the beginning of last night's show. In a statement, the network says it is pulling the plug for financial reasons, but some are questioning the timing after Colbert recently criticized the $16 million settlement CBS parent company Paramount made.  with President Trump ahead of a pending merger with Skydance. Well, the late show debuted with David Letterman, and that was back in 1993. We have much more to come here on Morning News Now later this hour. A troubling trend, cancers that affect the digestive system are on the rise among younger Americans. The warning from doctors on what you can do to stay healthy. But at first, after the break, outrage in the Middle East and beyond after an Israeli strike on Gaza's only Catholic church. Stay with us.  We're back now with a deadly strike on the only Catholic church in Gaza that's prompted international outrage. The church was hit by an Israeli tank shell that resulted in the deaths of three people and injured several others, including the parish priest. Well, the attack prompted a rebuke from President Trump, who personally called Israel's prime minister to condemn the strike. NBC News international correspondent Matt Bradley has the details.  Take a look at the damage to Gaza's only Catholic church after it was struck by Israeli artillery. The building is still standing, but church officials say three people were killed. Two of them buried their funerals at the neighboring Greek Orthodox Church. As they were leaving, after finishing their prayer, they were targeted, said this man who was sheltering in the church. The strike prompting a call and criticism from President Trump. What is the president's reaction to that church coming under fire?  It was not a positive reaction. He called Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning to address the strikes on that church in Gaza. The IDF says fragments from a tank shell fired nearby hit the church mistakenly. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is saying Israel deeply regrets that its stray ammunition hit Gaza's Holy Family Church.  Every innocent life lost is a tragedy. We share the grief of the families and the faithful. Among the lately injured was the parish priest, Father Gabriele Romanelli. It was Father Romanelli who the late Pope Francis called every day in the months before he died to check up on the church and the tiny Catholic community here as it kept its faith under fire.  Our thanks to Matt Bradley for that report. Well, Pope Leo responded to the strike, calling it a military attack on the church, saying he was deeply saddened. He also renewed his call for an immediate ceasefire. New developing news this morning. Out of Russia, its defense ministry says its forces have destroyed a wave of Ukrainian drones. NBC News international correspondent Claudia LaVanga joins us live with more details on other world news in 60 seconds. Claudia, good morning.  Savannah, good morning. Well, that's right. Russia's defense ministry said at least 73 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight, including three heading for Moscow. Now, there were no reports of casualties or damage, but operations at two airports near Russia's capital and one in St. Petersburg were all temporarily suspended and reinstated later this morning. There was no immediate comment by Ukraine on the attacks.  Let's go now to Pakistan, where the monsoon killed at least 63 people in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll since the heavy rain started three weeks ago to at least 178. Pakistan's meteorological department said the country experienced 82% more rainfall compared to the same period last year.  And let's end this tour of the world in South Korea, where a new K-pop group called One Verse has released its album today. But it's not your typical K-pop band. Two of its members are North Korean defectors, two are from Arkansas and Los Angeles, and the last one is from Japan. The two defectors said they could not listen to K-pop while growing up in North Korea because it's illegal there. Well, now they're both on their way to K-pop stardom. Incredible story.  Wow, it really is an incredible story. Claudio, thank you so much. Coming up, a controversial new strategy in the fight against America's drug crisis.

Because early detection can save lives. Ann Thompson, NBC News.  Let's stay with health news now. When it comes to fighting drug abuse, one of the most difficult addictions is methamphetamine. Unlike other drugs, there's no medical treatment available that actually counteracts those intense cravings that users have. And its use is on the rise across the country. Well, today, we're taking a look at a startling, somewhat controversial approach to fighting this addiction. It centers around incentives, and it's called contingency management.  Here's kind of how it works. So when patients of a clinic, if they stay clean and their testing proves it when they come, they are rewarded with things like a debit card loaded with cash or a prize. New York Times health reporter Jan Hoffman joins me now. She covers drug addiction and health law. And she wrote this recent article. The headline here was it's upended by meth. Some communities are paying users to quit.  Jan good morning. This headline certainly caught my attention. We appreciate your time and you joining us this morning.

This was not a triumph of branding. It has actually been around for quite a while. It's just that its adoption is really gaining traction. The VA has been using it.  since at least 2011. The idea of it is that meth can give someone an extraordinary hit of dopamine. So how do you compete with that? You can't do it medically. The idea is to try to generate those feelings of well-being and happiness on your own. So what happens is someone comes in, if their urine tests negative,  they get a small reward. It's almost like a pat on the back. And they see and they get a burst of satisfaction, encouragement. And each time they come in successively, that amount rises. It starts very small and it really never gets very large. But people come in for that encouragement, for that feeling of well-being, for that feeling of healing. And frankly, the longer one is abstinent from meth,  the ability to sleep gets better, the ability to eat gets better, and your feeling of normalcy, of returning to a life that is not infused with drugs improves. And so the benefits accumulate along with the reward, whether it's a gift card to Dunkin' Donuts or another store of your choice.

The question is, are you willing to pay that cost for the outcome? And in terms of success rates, contingency management, CM, is about 50% likely to succeed a year after someone completes treatment. Typically,  one should understand that you go through the treatment and as you become more used to being in recovery, you become more amenable to other interventions like social services, talk therapy, group therapy, and your life  hopefully begins to improve.

Up next, how AI is being used to fight back against health insurance companies. This is Morning News Now.  We're back with a frustrating challenge that millions of Americans deal with every year. Denied health insurance claims. A 2023 study shows that nearly one in five adults had their insurance company deny coverage or claim I'm one of them. The majority of people did not know, though, that they could appeal. Well, now more people are turning to artificial intelligence to help them fight back. NBC News business and data correspondent Brian Chunk shows us how it works.  I basically avoided stairs if I could. That's because every step was grueling for Stephanie Nixdorf.

Well, let's stay with Money News for a check at what's making headlines on Wall Street, starting with a first-of-its-kind victory for the crypto industry. CNBC's Savannah Hinao has more on that, plus some other Money News. Hey, Savannah, good morning. Hey, Savannah, good morning. Happy Friday to you. Well, the House passing a bill to regulate stablecoins. It's the first major cryptocurrency measure approved by Congress.  the Genius Act, which was already passed by the Senate that would regulate tokens that are pegged to assets such as the dollar. Now, this will pave the way for banks to launch their own digital assets. Earlier this week, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the company was going to be involved in both J.P. Morgan branded deposit coins and stable coins.  Meanwhile, Union Pacific is reportedly in talks to buy Norfolk Southern in a deal that could create the nation's largest railroad operator. The Union Pacific has a market value of about $140 billion, while Norfolk is valued at $61 billion. Now, a combined company would handle a sizable share of freight shipped in the US with a network coast to coast. Any deal would face serious scrutiny from federal regulators and labor unions.  And Disney's live-action remake of Lilo and Stitch tops $1 billion at the global box office, the first movie to do so this year. The original animated movie, which came out in 2002, was only a modest success at the time, bringing in $273 million. But the Stitch character has become more popular since ranking in the top 10 of the best  selling Disney franchises. Sales of Stitch-themed merchandise bringing in about $2.6 billion last year, Savannah. Wow. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Huge. That is huge. Savannah, thank you. Sure. Well, coming up, a big birthday celebration for a very small price. Pretzels, pretzels, pretzels. Apple pie from Popeye's. A blast freeze at Taco Bell. Up next, we'll introduce you to a man who spent his special day cashing in on all the freebies he could find. We'll join the party next on Morning News Now.  We're ending this hour with a celebration. It's a pretty popular trend for companies to treat their customers to small giveaways when it's their birthday, right? Well, NBC News correspondent Camila Bernal is introducing us to one birthday boy who took full advantage of his special day with a freebie frenzy.  Let me show you everyone getting free food today on my birthday. Full price is for quitters. Free pretzels at Wetzel's Pretzels. Apple pie from Popeyes. A Baja Blast Freeze at Taco Bell. We got a small orange chicken this year. Because there's always a deal Clint Sovatos can help you find. Only pay $1 for the $6 taco. Especially on your birthday. I'm always looking for a deal. I'm always looking to save money. Six lemon pepper wings at Buffalo Wild Wings.  As the Wall Street Journal reported, this trend is on the rise. He's one of many on social media competing for free treats and even meals. This thing is ginormous. Free Whopper at Burger King. The preparation takes months.

Right now on Morning News Now, yet another bombshell from the White House in the case of Jeffrey Epstein. President Trump facing mounting pressure from his base, now saying he'll release some parts of the grand jury testimony from the Epstein case.  But it's being eclipsed by a stunning new report from the Wall Street Journal alleging Mr. Trump wrote a letter to Mr. Epstein more than 20 years ago, which included a drawing of a naked woman. The commander-in-chief angrily denying the report as fresh concerns come to light over his health. We are following it all.

We've got your front-row seat to the latest and greatest from the world of Hollywood and beyond. Everything you simply can't miss this weekend.  Thanks for joining us this Friday morning. We are going to begin this hour with those new questions about President Trump's past relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The president is denying a report. This is from the Wall Street Journal. It's about a letter he allegedly wrote to Epstein more than two decades ago. According to documents reviewed by the journal, the letter reportedly including an outline of a naked woman.  Now, NBC News has not independently verified or seen the letter, but the president is now threatening legal action. This all comes as Mr. Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce, quote, pertinent testimony tied to the Epstein case. The president has been facing pressure by members of his own party to make those files public. NBC's Ryan Nobles has the latest developments from Washington.  This is a dramatic shift for the president, who had dismissed the Epstein controversy and called his supporters focused on it stupid and foolish. The question this morning, will the limited release of information he's asked to be made public be enough to satisfy those who want to know everything about the Epstein saga? This morning, a surprising move from President Trump, under pressure from his base.  This has been the first fracture in MAGA.

Well, meanwhile, the White House is opening up about a recent medical diagnosis for President Trump. It said the president has chronic venous insufficiency. It's a common condition in people over 70. It impacts the veins. NBC News Senior White House Correspondent Gabe Gutierrez joins us with the latest on that. Gabe, good morning. What more are we learning here?  Hey there, Savannah. Good morning. It is a common condition, especially in older adults, that occurs when veins have trouble moving blood back to the heart. Now, the White House press secretary disclosing the diagnosis unprompted during a briefing yesterday, saying the president was evaluated in recent weeks.  After these images of President Trump started to draw attention, apparent swelling in his ankles and bruises on his hands covered with makeup, the White House delivering a health update Thursday, revealing he's been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a swelling of the legs caused by blood pooling in the veins.  nine in common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70. Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. The administration releasing this physician's letter that notes an echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness were identified, adding the president remains in excellent health.  Symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency can include pins and needles in the legs, discolored skin, or in rare cases, ulcers near the ankles. The president is 79 and is known for staying on his feet. No discomfort from the president at all, and you probably all see that on a day-to-day basis. He's working around the clock.  The White House also providing an update after photos of bruising on the president's hands emerged, seen in February during a meeting with the French president. And this week, a camera captured it as he was speaking to reporters. The White House physician says it's consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin taken as a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.

Well, all across the country, people cannot seem to catch a break from the extreme summer weather. Today, millions of Americans will be feeling the heat with temperatures soaring, and we're still seeing heavy downpours in parts of the South and the Midwest.  Chicago living up to its nickname with 60 mile per hour winds whipping through the city. Yesterday, cleanup crews sawed through branches from downed trees and surveyed the damage to homes. NBC News correspondent George Solis has been tracking all this extreme weather for us from New Orleans, where the rain there has just been relentless. George, good morning.  Good morning, Savannah. Residents in New Orleans actually breathing a little bit of a relief because the severe weather brought on by that tropical moisture was not as severe as anticipated. It's not to say, though, that some communities were not inundated with water. In fact, several west of the city saw several inches. Now, fortunately, that has started to recede. But unfortunately, the threat of severe weather not over. Millions still under flood watches and that oppressive heat.  This morning, many Americans waking up to more storms and flood warnings, and 17 million under flood watch, ready for another soggy weekend in a summer full of them.

This is something that folks are going to be keeping a close watch on because there's still flood watches in effect for the central Gulf Coast. The other part of this, again, the heat. It has actually been very humid here in New Orleans. But some good news for you there in New York, the heat wave there in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic finally starting to break.  Savannah. That is a little bit of good news, George, but so much going on around the country. Thank you so much. Well, parts of the South and the Mid-Atlantic, they're still under flood watches, as we heard. Let's get a check on your morning news now, whether Angie Lastman is tracking these downpours for us. Angie, good morning. Hi there, Savannah. Good morning to you. It wouldn't be the weekend if we didn't have some impactful weather to highlight as we roll into our Saturday and Sunday plans. Here's the deal right now. We've got some of these showers across parts of the Ohio Valley, back through the Central Plains, and then, yes, across parts of the Gulf Coast. And those are going to be there here  through the day today. So not surprising that we have these flood alerts that are up for 17 million people right now. Much of those extend into the mid-Atlantic and, of course, the Gulf Coast, because we do just have those really saturated grounds and already have had ample amounts of rain in some of those spots, with more on the way. Here's how it plays out today. It's going to be the scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Southeast, the mid-Atlantic, the Gulf Coast, and even the Midwest through the day today. We'll watch for the potential for flooding, of course, today and tomorrow.  Notice that big batch of moisture that works along that cold front tomorrow across parts of the Great Lakes. We'll see the potential to see some of those thunderstorms kind of ramp up and potentially be strong to even severe. Today, though, we're really going to watch parts of the Mid-Atlantic for that moderate risk of flash flooding. We've got the saturated soil, so any additional rain is going to be problematic. And we could see some really impressive hourly rainfall rates with this, up to three inches. So no surprise if we get the potential for some flash flooding across that area through the day today.  On top of that, a couple of spots to watch for the stronger storms. I mentioned all of those impacts are going to be on the table for the mid-Atlantic, for parts of the Midwest, Sioux Falls, Omaha, Norfolk, Raleigh, all included in that. And then tomorrow, that's centered across the Great Lakes and into the Ohio Valley. So if you live in Columbus, Detroit, Fort Wayne, Chicago, Des Moines, Milwaukee, all those locations, going to see the potential to see some of those thunderstorms ramp up and potentially become strong or severe.  On top of that, it really feels like summer out there. We've got plenty of heat alerts up and notice they're in effect for parts of South Florida as well. Now that happened early this morning, but the Carolinas back across parts of the Tennessee Valley and stretching to the South. 19 million people in total under these heat alerts, so going to need to take it slow and find those cool spots once again in those locations today. But we've got a little bit of relief a little farther to the North. Savannah temperatures only in the 80s in Boston, and then we kind of moderate out here as we get into our upcoming weekend.  All right, Andrew Lassman, thank you so much. Well, now let's get to a major development in the Brian Koberger quadruple murder case. After two and a half years and countless legal proceedings, an Idaho judge lifted a sweeping gag order on the case yesterday. This decision comes just days before Koberger's sentencing. He pleaded guilty to all counts earlier this month. NBC News correspondent Liz Kreutz has been following the story and joins us from Los Angeles with more. Hi, Liz. Good morning.  Hey, Savannah, good morning. Yeah, that gag order was put in place as a way to ensure a fair trial. It strictly limited any public comment by attorneys, law enforcement, and witnesses involved. But now this new development paves the way to potentially learn more about the murders, with Brian Koberger's sentencing scheduled for next week.

Now that Koberger's pleaded guilty, there's not going to be a jury, so there's no jury pool to taint.  The gag order was issued early on amid intense media scrutiny and public interest in the case to ensure a fair trial. Gag orders are incredibly rare in criminal trials.

Let's just take a look at David Letterman. He had his own show on Netflix. Conan O'Brien with a travel series on HBO Max. So we're all going to stay tuned to see what the next chapter will be for Colbert. But I can tell you one thing, Savannah, he always lands on his feet.  Yeah, and big people get their big stars start there, right? You intern there. I interned for Stephen Colbert at Comedy Central, one of the nicest guys. And this 200-person staff, Savannah, a lot of them came from the Colbert Report at Comedy Central because they all say Stephen Colbert is the best boss. I know, and he really shouted his team out, which was really cool in that announcement. Chloe, thank you so much. Texas bus drivers who are being hailed as heroes this morning, their selfless actions in the wake of those devastating Hill Country floods. That's next.  Let's  passed $9 billion in funding cuts as requested by the White House. Republicans voted largely along party lines to claw back billions in funding for foreign aid programs through groups like the World Health Organization and the United Nations, and significant cuts to public broadcasting here at home, PBS, and NPR. They did reject Republicans, that is, a request to cut funding for PEPFAR Savannah, credited as the most successful global health program ever, signed into law by President George W. Bush,  It has saved millions of people from contracting HIV and AIDS. But still, Democrats say Republicans broke what is supposed to be a bipartisan process, funding the government, as the president pushes ahead with plans to sign the cuts into law today.  Speaking of signing bills into law, President Trump is also expected to sign a major cryptocurrency bill just passed by the House. The Genius Act will regulate issuers of stablecoins, its digital asset, usually pegged to the U.S. dollar. Supporters say this will help legitimize the industry and make it more mainstream. Crypto has already come such a long way. It's not the small, underground, under-the-radar industry anymore. So many people use it  and their lobbying efforts really paid off. Crypto groups have been all over the Capitol and even spending big in elections. In a big bipartisan vote, the House also passed a second crypto bill overnight, but the Senate still needs to vote on it.  And let's stick with the Senate because that is where Democrats stormed out of a Judiciary Committee meeting yesterday when it was time to vote on some of President Trump's judicial nominees. Over one of them, Emil Bovee. Republicans pushed forward with a committee vote anyway, but Senator Cory Booker asked for more time to debate Bovee's nomination.  Democrats raised concerns over Bovey, who was President Trump's personal attorney, over some of his more controversial decisions at the DOJ, including a letter from a whistleblower last month who was fired from the Justice Department, alleging Bovey wanted the Trump administration to ignore court orders, especially in that deportations case. Republicans sent his nomination to the full Senate for a vote soon. And that is a look at what is making news in politics this morning. Savannah?  All right, Julie, so much going on. Thank you very much. Well, two weeks ago, as flash floods swept through Texas's Kerr County, one group of bus drivers braved the floodwater and drove into danger to get children to safety. Those drivers now, of course, being hailed as heroes. Reporter Jordan Elder from our affiliate in San Antonio has the story.  Through raging waters and broken roads, Amanda Nicholson says there was only one option. Our family was in trouble and we were able to help in the best way that we could.  full speed ahead behind the wheel of a school bus where we picked up a bunch of the mystic girls that they had drove in from camp. All we knew is that we had a bunch of young girls holding each other's hands waiting to get on our buses. Amanda has her commercial driver's license to take her Tyvee High School volleyball team to and from games on July 4th. The stakes were much higher. A lot of these girls had pajamas on.  A lot of them didn't have shoes. They had nothing but each other. And so that was a hard view in itself that this happened while they were sleeping. Millions of people across the world have seen this video.  Girls from Camp Mystic singing on their way to safety. For Amanda, the journey was more somber. She watched as children ran off her bus and into the arms of their worried parents. To see fear in everybody was extremely difficult. And it was extremely difficult to have. Some of those parents. Ask you.  When everybody got off your bus, is that it? Because they didn't see their child. And so that was really hard."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 81, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 4786.135, "text": "There are people who are calling you and the other bus drivers that went in there to help evacuate people heroes."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 82, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 4793.283, "text": "Do you see it that way?

Well, coming up, there is a new push in Silicon Valley this morning looking to give babies the genetic edge when Morning News now returns the science and the skepticism over one company's controversial embryo screening process. And spoiler alert, it is not cheap. We will explain up next.  We are back with a controversial idea. It's gaining momentum, though, in the fertility and biotech space. This is screening embryos for hundreds of genetic conditions. It is a process that has been described as breeding so-called super babies. The Silicon Valley company Orchid Health is promising the, quote, most thorough embryo screening available  through what's referred to as genetic prediction. The first-of-its-kind test can allegedly detect significantly more risks of gene mutations and abnormalities than the screenings currently used by most IVF clinics. But some medical experts are skeptical, arguing the science behind the tests is flawed.  Washington Post Silicon Valley correspondent Elizabeth Dwoskin joins us now with more of her reporting on this. Elizabeth, good morning. Such a talker, certainly controversial both from a medical perspective and then I think also just people's opinions on something like this being possible and should we do it or not. I know you spoke to Orchid Health's CEO and several medical experts, even families who have used this new type of embryo screening. So first just talk me through how this works, why it's different than the current testing available or for the many families that go through IVF, the kind of  typical testing that doctors want to see those embryos go through before they're implanted. What's different here?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 87, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 4970.474, "text": "Sure. Well, I think the core question for anyone watching this, even people who might not have access to this because it is expensive, is would you want to know if your future child was going to get cancer, potentially, or diabetes? And would you want to know their traits, potentially, such as their intelligence and height? Because that is what's happening and what's coming because of a wave of these new genetic tests.  One, the family that we interviewed, for example, and this is fairly common, people who go to these kinds of services, you might have a rare disease in your family. It could be someone who had extreme bipolar disorder. In the case of the family I spoke to, they discovered at their IVF clinic that they had a gene for hearing loss.  And they wanted to know if they were going to pass those genes on to their embryos. And that's not something that a standard test can see. IVF clinics sometimes have to get data from the parents, in this case the family they were  They were immigrants. The parents were in another country that doesn't do genetic testing. But what Orca does and some other companies that are launching or just launched they do a version and they all do a different version of it. But they do like a full genome sequence. So your genome has three billion base pairs three billion base pairs.  If you've ever taken a test like that where you get your blood drawn or your saliva, sometimes these tests like 23andMe, they'll only use a portion of the genome. What's new now is you can actually start to see the whole genome for a lot less money than you could a couple of years ago, which is why I think that these tests are going to come to more people.  And then seeing the whole genome allows you to potentially see more rare disorders. It also allows you to make predictions about diseases that could take place later in life, like Alzheimer's or breast cancer. Not even stuff the baby would be born with, but stuff your future child might be affected by as an adult."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 88, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 5082.877, "text": "And I know those several scientists you spoke to were pretty critical, right, of this genetic testing. What are they saying?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 89, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 5089.953, "text": " Some of the scientists, first of all, said it could be valuable for rare genetic disorders. But one thing to know is that there's still a lot we don't know about genes, particularly when it comes to predicting diseases that happen later in life. So, you know, I  There might be dozens, if not hundreds, or thousands of genes that go into play, that come into play, to impact whether I might get a disease, God forbid, like cancer, or bipolar disorder, or Alzheimer's, or obesity. And then there's a lot of environmental factors that also come into play. So scientists don't know everything about how the genes interact. They don't know how the environmental factors  And there's also this question of bias, because most people, it's not well known, but most people who have given up their genetic data for research in order to do these studies that allow us to make disease predictions are American and European. And so if you are African-American, you might have 50% less accuracy for tests like these."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 90, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 5151.817, "text": " I mean, by the way, I think one of the concerns here, right, is just what it costs. I think it's $2,500 just for a single embryo on top, of course, of the cost of IVF, which is so expensive, in some cases, beginning to be covered by insurance or companies for some people. But that certainly sort of gatekeeps, at least for now, the technology. And then there are ethical concerns. This concept I said of this sort of creating super babies. Tell us about those ethical concerns, what people think might not be right about this type of testing."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 91, "speaker": "Unidentified SPEAKER", "start": 5181.803, "text": " you"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 92, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 5183.221, "text": " did use the term super babies for so I believe that Savannah that the cost is going to come down because it has I mean 10 years ago genetic test was a huge consumer genetic test was over a 1000 as a $1000 right now it's under 300 in some cases. So I do believe the cost will come down. In terms of ethics, I think a lot of people I was just talking about this at dinner with some friends last night a lot of people don't want to know they feel like that's playing God that nature has done things in a certain way for a long time and  on some level, especially when you get into traits like intelligence or height, that might be playing God. You know, most people who, especially if you go to an IVF clinic and you're dealing with infertility, you're just happy to have embryos, to have a child. But I want to hold the other side, which is that we don't know a lot of the reasons for infertility today.  And possibly, I mean not possibly, it's known that a lot of that has genetic causes that are poorly understood. So for people who've had infertility, who are going the lengths to get IVF, which is expensive for many people, though it's increasingly going to be covered by insurers next year in California,  It's going to be a mandate to be covered by insurers. You know, it's not so far-fetched to think that if a genetic test can tell with certainty that you might pass on certain diseases to your baby, that new genetic tests would show even more diseases could be covered."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 93, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 5265.624, "text": "Elizabeth Dwoskin, certainly a talker.

The Netflix logo might be red, but the company's seeing green this morning after reporting its latest earnings. CNBC's Savannah Henao has that and some other money news. Hey, Savannah. Hey, Savannah. Good morning. Happy Friday to you. Yeah, certainly seeing green. Netflix reporting quarterly earnings that beat forecast, and that's thanks to the success of the final season of Squid Game.  That had 122 million views and of course also from continued gains from its ad supported tier. Now the streaming service is also raising sales guidance for the year, although all the stock is just slightly lower. As analysts say, the company is being too conservative with its outlook. Now Netflix does have several big shows coming later this year, including the second season of Wednesday and the final episodes of Stranger Things.  Peacock is raising prices next week and will start testing a new slimmed-down tier. The streaming service, which is owned by NBCUniversal and Comcast, will hike prices for the ad-supported premium plan by $3 to $10.99 a month and the premium-plus plan to $16.99 a month starting July 23rd.  Select here that will feature current seasons of NBC and Bravo shows and an assortment of older titles. That one will cost $7.99 a month. He got reported 41 million paid subscribers in the first quarter. That's up from 36 million at the end of last year.  And all right, well, it's Krispy Kreme's 80th birthday today, and the chain is giving customers a gift. When you buy any dozen donuts at regular price, you can get a second dozen original glazed for just 88 cents. And the deal is good at participating stores while supplies last. Now, if you do order online, use the code B-DAY to get the offer. The company was founded in 1937 in Winsome, Salem, North Carolina, Savannah.  88 years. I remember like maybe it was just that it was new that it came to San Diego but when it was like this, you know, big deal that it was like this novel thing. I mean they're still just like so recent. Yeah, I agree. I know. All right, Silvana, thank you so much. Coming up, if it's Friday, that can only mean one thing here on Morning News. Now when we come back, we've got your ticket to the world of Hollywood and beyond. Grab your popcorn, your coffee, everything you simply can't miss this weekend is next. Stick around.  Finally, this hour, it is Friday. Doesn't that feel good this week? It means it's time for your weekly can't miss list.

He is host and producer of USA Today's Entertain This and our friend Ralphie. Good morning. Savannah, good morning. A lot to get through this weekend. Interesting kind of things that are hitting the box office in terms of how they're rating critically. Let's start on Smurfs.  Okay, well, not rating as well, critically. Because we've been talking about these amazing movies, F1 and Jurassic World, and, like, these big, and, you know. Absolutely, yeah. But, you know, at least to the Jurassic point, this is a bit of a nostalgia play here. We've seen Superman, Jurassic, and maybe one more that we're going to talk about here shortly. Let's talk about a few positive things, though. First of all, only 89 minutes. Second of all, rated PG.  Well, it's so true in this day and age.

Maybe a good play with the kids if the weather's not great where your area is.  You're exactly right, and there's a lot of the country where it's not, so that's a good idea. OK, there's a new I Know What You Did last summer. This is kind of interesting. It's like part remake, part sequel, sort of. Correct. Yes, no, it is kind of a sequel to the 1997, oh my goodness, this came out originally in 97, original. And yes, we'll have Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. reprising their roles. They tell us it felt like a high school reunion. They really hadn't seen each other  since the late 90's, or worked together certainly since the late 90's in those movies. So a few new faces in here as well, Madeline Klein, Chase Sweet Wonders. Again, I know what you did last summer, the sequel, we'll call it a sequel. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. All right, also out in theaters, Eddington. This is a COVID era, right? But kind of like a Western people are calling it.  Yeah, and what's really weird is this was written before COVID, and then kind of during COVID, adapted to be a COVID-era Western standoff between a sheriff and a mayor, with, of course, Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal. This one, critically, if that's what we're gonna talk here, rated the best of all the movies we're talking about for Can't Miss List today. Also, it's A24, I see. I feel like they never miss.

You can watch it now on BritBox, and you can, you know, Google BritBox. You can subscribe. I believe you can subscribe through Prime Video as well.

All right, so part one premiered last month at Tribeca. Part one is premiering now tonight on HBO, and you'll be able to stream it on HBO Max as well. Then we get part two the following weekend, and this is interesting. The highs and lows of the piano man's life. Some interesting cameos in here, too, including Bruce Springsteen, who says some very interesting things about his music compared to Billy's. That's a little tease for you. I don't want to give too much away. But you realize how high Billy's career went and how low his life went at some points.  as you watch this first part. Wow, so interesting. Okay, speaking of music, we've only got 20 seconds here, but Trisha Yearwood out with her first album, her next album, 16th album, actually, in a long time, and she also did this whole one herself. Yeah, she wrote it, which is something that's kind of rare for country, at least compared to the other genres, but she wrote this whole album. Little Lady, if you need one track off of this one, I would listen to that one. Okay, there you go. Ralphie, perfect. Thank you so much. Great to see you. Happy watching. Happy weekend.

If they leave the employment and leave the labor force, you don't see a big change in  Now, it can potentially affect the break-even rate that you would need to have the market going well.

Whether they're going to work, they're not going to work, but they're still here.  I don't, where I think the immigration stuff, if immigration was a big factor, you'd be seeing shortages and you might see some in some industries. But like I pointed out, if you look at the new college graduate unemployment rate, it's 7%. It's much higher than it has. These are not jobs that are being opened up because immigrants are not coming in.  That should be just the opposite. If immigrants are leaving and these jobs are open, then the unemployment rate should go the other way. So that unemployment rate, to me, is telling me immigration is not the source of the problem.

So you put on a tariff. As long as it's a one-time tariff and that's it...  That's a one-time price effect. I mean, this is economic theory. You could not get in any serious economic model persistent inflation from that. You would have to cook up some other amplification mechanisms and that's what people talk about. Wages will start going up and everything will get out of control. You're not seeing that at all. This is just not. Those kind of amplification mechanisms where wage price spirals aren't happening.  Tariffs are a tax. And in public finance, you learn that you may levy a tax on a firm, but who bears the incidence or the burden of that tax? It can be a group of people or one person, not necessarily the firm. So this is what I've heard from a lot of firms. If there's a 10% tax, they'll force their suppliers to eat some of that cost. Workers may eat some of that cost in terms of less hiring and things like that. The firm will take it out of their profit margins.  And then lastly, some of it will get passed on. And as I mentioned last night, I've heard this for months now. The rule is 10% is roughly, rule of thumb is a third, a third, a third. Suppliers will eat a third. Firms will eat a third. Consumers are going to eat a third of that tariff. So if you eat a third of it, and it's 10%, like I've been arguing, this is like 3 tenths of a, 3 tenths on the inflation rate for a few months. And that's it.  And it'll persist if you do 12-month over 12-month. That base effect will not go away for a while, and then it'll just drop off a cliff.

If it's still just a question of delaying it, that doesn't change my argument. Whether you see the spike in July or it happens in June or August or September, when it happens is irrelevant for the economics. That's a non-starter of an argument.  Firms could also just spread it out in smaller increments over several months. The total effect still ends up being the same. They just get there in a later fashion. And it'll be smaller amounts.

We're going to begin this morning with the increasing pressure on the Trump administration to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The president posted on social media last night that he's directed his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to produce what he calls pertinent testimony tied to the Epstein case. Earlier on Thursday, the White House said it would not appoint a special counsel to review the case.  In a new development here, the Wall Street Journal has published a story. It says that more than two decades ago, President Trump wrote a letter to Jeffrey Epstein that reportedly included an outline of a naked woman and a Donald signature. This was part of a bunch of letters for a birthday. The president has denied writing the letter, calling it fake and threatening to sue the paper. The journal story says that Mr. Trump was asked to contribute to this collection of letters that Epstein's then confidant Ghislaine Maxwell was planning to give to Epstein for that birthday.  NBC News has not independently verified that or seen the letter. Meanwhile, we're also learning more about the president's medical diagnosis. He has a condition that causes blood to pool in his legs. The White House addressed the condition yesterday during its press briefing.  This concern was thoroughly evaluated by the White House Medical Unit. The President underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency. Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.  We'll have much more ahead this hour on President Trump's medical diagnosis, as well as that latest victory in Congress. But let's begin with NBC News White House correspondent Vaughn Hilliard. We're going to start with the latest in the Epstein controversy. Vaughn, good morning. So first, let's start with this Wall Street Journal article. It was published last night. This is this letter, they say, President Trump allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. In a phone interview with the journal, the president denied writing that letter. We know he's also threatening legal action in response, something we've seen him do before, of course, to press. What more can you tell us?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 125.632, "text": " Right, this is a president that has a deep history of denials. He says that this letter was not written by him, and the caricature of the woman's body that is described in this Wall Street Journal story was not drawn by him. The Wall Street Journal moved forward with the publication of this, despite, as they say, on Tuesday night, they talked directly with the president, who threatened to sue them if they moved forward with publishing their reporting here.  The Wall Street Journal is outlining not criminal activity by the president, to be clear, but suggesting that, as part of the files that the Department of Justice has, as it pertains to its longstanding investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, that there are files that had not been publicly made available at this point in time that pertain to the now president.  At the same time, the Department of Justice has made it clear that they had released previously all information that was relevant, would they say, to any criminal investigations. That is longstanding practice to not release evidence that does not directly implicate anybody in a direct indictment. And so there is a question here moving forward.  as to what other references there may be in files related to the president who had a lengthy relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. But again, it's a question of what may amount to just simply evidence of a relationship, but that is not any\u2014that would not contribute to any allegation of criminal wrongdoing by the president."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 222.899, "text": " Von, the president said, though, he's not planning to appoint a special counsel to review the Epstein case.

And, of course,  The DOJ and the FBI have outlined that there were more than 1,000 victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and there are sensitive details that have been redacted about Jeffrey Epstein's dealings and relationships, not wanting to reveal the identities of those victims or difficult details from the evidence that was gathered.  These are not just grand jury testimony, which Pam Bondi, the attorney general, indicated last night at the request of the president. She will seek to unseal and release. But this is a question also of other records that may be on hand here. And, of course, this is all part of now many years in the making, an effort by those particularly on the right, allies of the president, to have more records of Jeffrey Epstein involved, but not  under the scope that the president, President Trump, would be implicated in any of this.

The White House says that there are not any more serious symptoms for the president, that he is not taking any other steps outside of taking the aspirin for this cause here. But at the same time, this is acknowledged by the White House after the questions about these images here came out, Savannah."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 421.822, "text": " All right, Vaughn Hilliard, thank you so much for joining us on this, covering a lot for us this morning. Let's bring in NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel on this. Dr. Patel, good morning. So this is being called a common condition, especially for someone of the president's age. A lot of people, though, might not have heard of this chronic venous insufficiency. First, just explain what it is, if you don't mind. Vaughn did a good job, showed those pictures, kind of like what it can present as. But what exactly is going on in the body?  The vanity did indeed. It is a chronic common condition. About one in 20 Americans actually have this diagnosis especially after the age of 50. And what it really involves are the veins. The veins are the big pipes in your body that bring blood back to your heart. And because of gravity the way we sit the way we stand they have these valves that are pretty tough that go one way always to bring the blood back to your heart over time.  and associated especially with obesity, high blood pressure, and some other common metabolic conditions, those valves can become very weak and blood can unfortunately go the reverse direction and pool. That's why you see that swelling around the legs and ankles. Again, very common and a chronic progressive condition. And what's the treatment for this? How does it impact someone's life?  Right. So the treatment depends on the stages. Let's just assume just based on what the president's physician reported in the pictures that we have that this is probably in the early to moderate stages. This is right at the time where you would do very conservative therapy things like compression stockings. Normally I would tell patients to try to elevate their legs and then to try to ambulate not to sit for prolonged periods of time.  Try telling that to an active president. So in addition to this he might be evaluated. There are medical interventions everything from over from prescription pharmaceutical drugs all the way to more intensive therapies that can be done laser therapy surgeries. But it doesn't seem like the president's condition is advanced enough to merit that. But treatment options abound.  I want to ask you also about those bruises on the president's hand that have been seen, and then also those questions that Vaughn had just mentioned there about makeup, that it looked like was covering them. Again, the president's 79 years old. I think people have seen those types of markings on the back of somebody who's a little bit older's hand. But is this related? Does that seem serious?  No, the two are unlikely related. And by the way, anybody over the age of about 60 who's ever had an IV in their hand isn't exactly what their hands look like. And it can last, by the way, bruising can last for weeks. And so hard to know kind of what exactly caused it. Certainly taking a low dose of aspirin, as they expressed the president is doing, can certainly make that worse. But it is something that overall isn't shocking, but not related to the venous insufficiency.  And doctor, does any of these things, the venous insufficiency, what we were just discussing with the hands, does any of it make you kind of like concerned the bigger picture of the president's health overall, or does this seem kind of unsurprising to you given his age? So the bigger picture is overall not concerning. The fact that he has chronic venous insufficiency does not automatically correlate to something life-threatening like sudden cardiovascular disease. However, given his age, given the fact that we know between weight, age, lifestyle,  that none of this is shocking and I would just say that these are all things that if this were any patient of mine with the exact same conditions would merit kind of lifestyle changes. Again, how do you do that as the president of the United States? I do think that it would be nice to see more complete records with the numbers with some of these kind of underlying metabolic assumptions that the president's physician just put in kind of a shorter statement. I think that would reassure everybody and also give us a little bit more of a picture into  what is likely a normal aging process for a 79-year-old. But again, these are things that should be monitored. They can lead to more serious conditions, and we'll just be watching over time.  Dr. Patel, really good insight. Thank you so much. Well, in a victory for the president on Capitol Hill, the House passed legislation requested by Mr. Trump to rescind funding for foreign aid and also public broadcasting. So House Republicans approved this bill. It actually caused back a total of $9 billion. It includes about $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. That is what funds NPR and PBS.  The other $8 billion there comes from cuts to foreign aid, and the bill now heads to President Trump's desk. We have NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Julie Serkin. Here's the twist, though. She's in studio with us. Julie, good morning. Great to have you here in New York with us. So first, just walk us through how this bill passed and talk about the impact of what is being cut here.  Yeah, Savannah, so good to be in studio with you. There was a very late night on Capitol Hill. I was not there, I was traveling here, but our colleagues covered this vote. And we keep getting used to these late nights on the Hill because President Trump is putting so much pressure on Republicans to get his agenda done. So what this package does is exactly what you laid out. Congress appropriates funds, they have the power of the purse. In this very unusual case, the president and the executive branch asked them to essentially claw that money back, to undo the money they already appropriated.  So now you have these $9 billion in cuts for foreign aid programs with the WHO, the USAID, the UN. PEPFAR, though, was saved from this program. About $400 million, Republicans told the president they're not going to agree to cut. And that was, of course, signed into law by President Bush in 2003 and had tremendous success. But there are still real concerns about the cuts Congress did make in this package. Two Republicans voted against it in both the Senate and the House.  Savannah. And this is not the last package that the president is going to request Congress to cut. And remind everyone what PEPFAR is and why we think that survived. So PEPFAR is the program that protected millions from contracting HIV and AIDS. It protected the kids and the children of people who had it.  And this was such a successful program, it is actually billed as the most successful global health program ever. And we already saw some controversy surrounding it with the Republicans in Congress delaying approving the funds for it because of some abortion concerns, especially in Africa. And so now you have this situation where some Republicans push back successfully to save it. But again, this is not the end of the road for these rescissions. The administration is going to keep asking Congress to do more to try and cut into some of the deficits they say we have.  such  I actually had to look up on my screen when I saw Cory Booker speaking and Chuck Grassley, the top Republican, talking over him. Democrats really tried to slow walk the nomination of Emil Bovee. He's somebody who's been close to the president. He was his defender in court during some of his prosecutions, especially in New York. And so he is somebody the Democrats said is not qualified for this job. He's somebody who whistleblowers allege.  told the president and the administration to ignore court orders, and Democrats had big concerns. Republicans pushed ahead with the votes anyway. Booker was talking over Grassley while the votes were happening. Democrats walked out of the room. There were some questions whether the votes were approved in committee, since Democrats weren't in there. But the full Senate is going to vote on his nomination, and Republicans are in control, so it's probably going to pass. One other thing I want to ask you about, especially because I think there could be some headlines coming out of this, NBC News is learning that Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan is expected to be  deposed today. This is part, though, of a much broader lawsuit. It alleges that he failed to protect wrestlers from a sexual predator when he was a coach at Ohio State University. Jordan, though, is not the target of this lawsuit, but it is the first time that he's going to be answering questions under oath about it. What can you tell us about this? What are we hearing from Jordan? And what exactly is his piece of this puzzle?  So way before he got into politics, I know you probably know him from being that gangbuster kind of defender for the president on the Hill. He's very aggressive when he chairs hearings. He's a chairman of powerful committees, including the Judiciary Committee in the House currently. And so in this situation, Jordan is not a defendant in this case, but he is going to take the stand. He used to be a wrestling coach decades ago, in the late 80s, early 90s, at Ohio State University. And there's a situation where wrestlers there, both non-athletes and students, by the way,  Athletes and students alike are concerned about these allegations of sexual abuse that happen at the school, particularly to these wrestling students, students who were wrestling at the school. And Jordan, for his part, a spokesperson, says, as everyone knows, Chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it. Jordan has always said that he was not aware that any abuse was going on. Again, he's not in trouble here in terms of being named as a defendant, but he's definitely somebody they have  questions for. I assume Jordan is going to stick to that line, though. Yeah. All right. Julie Cirkin, thanks. Great to have you here in New York with us. Thank you. Well, a federal judge is considering an unusual recommendation from the Justice Department.

It was very traumatic for him. He's hoping to be home now, recovering from first degree burns. Again, back here in New Orleans and surrounding region, they are still looking at the potential of some more rain this weekend. So not completely out of the woods, but again, looking around at some of the wet streets here, they're just grateful the flooding here was not more severe."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1204.096, "text": " back to you. George, thank you so much. Well now let's turn to NBC meteorologist Angie Lassman for the latest on that heavy rain and the flood risks in the South and the Midland. Okay, Angie, good morning. Hi, Savannah, good morning to you. We head into the weekend with more severe potential when it comes to strong storms as well as flooding threats.  So here's the lay of the land right now. Notice these scattered storms that are, yes, across parts of the South. We've got a bit in the plains, some of that working across the Ohio Valley. And these are just some locations that we're expecting to see potentially some flooded streets and maybe some stronger storms develop. Right now, 17 million people under these flood alerts stretching from the coast back towards Kentucky. We've got parts of the central Gulf Coast still under these alerts as well.  And these are going to last through the day today as we gear up for additional rainfall on those already saturated grounds. So across parts of the South, the Gulf Coast specifically, that's where you'll see the potential for more of that localized flooding that you just heard George talking about. But the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the South, these are also going to get in on those downpours as well. So we'll see some localized flooding there tomorrow. Looking ahead to your Saturday, it's the Great Lakes and parts of the Midwest that we'll see dealing with the potential for some of those showers and thunderstorms.  Today, the flash flood risk we're most concerned about is centered across the mid-Atlantic. We've got really saturated grounds from those recent rains, and we've got the potential to see some pretty good rainfall rates throughout the day per hour. So we could see up to three inches per hour. That's a potential just west of Washington, D.C. So heads up for that. This will be something you deal with through the day today.  And on top of that, the chance for some stronger storms. We've got all the impacts on the table today for 9 million people. And tomorrow, an even larger chunk of the country is going to deal with those. 41 million people stretching from New York to Iowa, including Detroit, Chicago, Indianapolis, all have the chance to see some of those stronger storms. Savannah, so it'll be another weekend where you'll want to have a way to get those weather alerts because, again, lots on the table. Such a good point and an important one after what we've seen happen lately. Angie, thank you so much.  Well, we're learning new details in a shocking murder that rocked a small town in May earlier this month. Yesterday, police arrested a teenager in connection with the homicide of a 48-year-old paddleboarder whose body was found at the water's edge. NBC News correspondent Erin McLaughlin has the latest on the details on the arrest.  A shocking development in the killing of Sunshine Stewart. A 17-year-old male is now in custody in connection with her homicide. The much-loved local was found dead near a campsite in the quiet town of Union, Maine. Police also confirming the 48-year-old was killed by strangulation and blunt force trauma. The news leaving close friend Chloe Keller stunned. That's inconceivable. I can't imagine being that age and making that choice to harm another human being.  Police say the 17-year-old was arrested without incident in Union late last night. They've yet to release his identity, pointing to his status as a minor, saying in a statement that the teen has been transported to a youth development center in South Portland.  According to police, Stewart's body was located during a search of Crawford Pond on July 3rd, last seen paddleboarding the evening before. A public safety official told local newspaper Midcoast Villager, Stewart's paddleboard was found by drone on an island called 100 Acre. Her body was next to it where the water met the shore. When a community that's been safe for time immemorial has its innocence robbed of it, it does shake the foundation of comfort and safety.  What do you want to see happen next? I think everyone, all of us who knew and loved her need to gather and be together and celebrate her. She was beloved, profoundly beloved by everyone I knew who knew her. Erin McLaughlin, NBC News.  Well, next week, Brian Koberger will be sentenced for the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students after pleading guilty. In anticipation of that, Judge Stephen Hipler has lifted a sweeping gag order in the case that just happened yesterday. The order banned police, prosecutors, and witnesses from speaking out about the case that captured national attention for two and a half years. Well, the plea deal shields Koberger from the death penalty.  NBC News legal analyst Danny Savalas joins us now with more on this. Danny, good morning. So let's start just with more on what lifting this gag order ultimately means. What does it open up in the case? What might we hear?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1465.0, "text": " Here's what it opens up and here's what it doesn't open up. The gang order prevented litigants from speaking about the case and people associated with them. So now presumably if those people want to speak they can. What it didn't address is something separate but related the sealing of documents.  And there are probably hundreds of documents in the court file that are sealed. The judge is still going to go through those and determine which of them will be unsealed. And that means basically available to the public in the courthouse. Some may remain sealed due to privacy reasons. But in all likelihood many of those will be unsealed because the default rule  Courts are supposed to be public. Sealing is supposed to be the exception, not the rule. So the only thing the gag order does is prevent people from speaking. That's been lifted because there's no chance of tainting any jury because there never will be a jury."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1518.125, "text": "And Danny, what might the judge decide to keep sealed?

It would have to be I'd have to see the documents or get an idea. But so many have been sealed. And in my personal view, probably too many, even though this is such a gruesome, tragic case.  I would expect this is a second judge now looking at the ceiling.

But then I'm also thinking that now that this is the outcome that we're seeing here, that he's taking this plea deal for the families. Do they want more information out there? Do they want to be reliving what happened to their children? Because it's of course going to become national conversation if there is anything new in any of this that comes out.  What do you take away from that? Who does this sort of help? Who does this hurt? And what might we hear in the coming days?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1593.783, "text": "One of the things this case highlights is that it's long been the rule that families of victims and victims themselves do not control litigation. They can be heard. They have a statutory right to be heard in many states and under some federal laws, but they don't control what the judge does with things like  private or very damaging or hurtful or tragic information that's contained in sealed court files. So while they may be heard, they ultimately cannot control. And this case is a great example because you have families of victims who have very divergent views on things like the level to which Kogelberger should have gone to trial or the level to which documents should be made public."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1635.785, "text": "Danny, we're just a few days away from Kogelberger's sentencing.

It's also an area that has seen an uptick of migrants are coming to extreme temperatures. Now this area of the border.  Criminal smugglers are known and cartel associates for using bolt cutters, grinders, and torches to breach the barrier of border wall. This area on the Mexican side is controlled by the La Le\u00f1a cartel who are known for using blow torches to cut through the steel mesh of border wall creating between two to three foot openings to send migrants right through. Smugglers often  actually arrive and pick up trucks with welding equipment, cut that mesh, and put it back in place and come back once they round up migrants from safe houses on the Mexican side in Juarez. This problem became so widespread for U.S. Border Patrol agents that it did prompt U.S. Customs and Border Protection to launch the 2021 Fence Cutter Initiative, which does prioritize the prosecution of individuals on the Mexican side and the U.S. side breaching that area of the border. Now, this new six miles of border wall will have  to get surveillance technology on the wall to then reduce that manpower on the ground.

I did want to take you out to the nation's capital as we've been following this news that did break a little bit earlier this morning. The House gave final approval to President Trump's request to claw back roughly $9 billion for public broadcasting and foreign aid. That all happened early this morning. We are hearing from President Trump. I did want to pull up this post here.  He posted this to Truth Social just a short time ago. He says House approves $9 billion cuts package, including atrocious NPR and public broadcasting, where billions of dollars a year were wasted. Republicans have tried doing this for 40 years and failed, but no more. This is big.  We're also hearing right now from House Speaker Mike Johnson. Here's what he had to say. President Trump and House Republicans promised fiscal responsibility and government efficiency. Today, we're once again delivering on that promise. The package eliminates $9 billion in unnecessary and wasteful spending at the State Department, USAID, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The American people will no longer be forced to fund politically biased media.  and more than $8 billion in outrageous expenses overseas. While Republicans continue to deliver real accountability, restore fiscal discipline, and protect taxpayer dollars, Democrats continue to defend waste, fraud, and abuse. This isn't the end, it's the beginning. We look forward to passing additional rescissions bills throughout the 119th Congress.  And once again, you are taking a live look there in Washington, D.C. And if you are just joining us, here's a little bit more information. The vote marked the first time in decades that a president has successfully submitted such a rescissions request to Congress. And the White House suggested it won't be the last, as we just heard there from Speaker Johnson.  Some Republicans were uncomfortable with the cuts, yet supported them anyways. The House passed the bill by a vote of 216 to 213, and now goes to President Trump for his signature. Opponents voiced concerns not only about the programs targeted, but about Congress ceding its spending powers to the executive branch as investments approved on a bipartisan basis were being subsequently canceled on party line votes.  They said previous rescission efforts had at least some bipartisan buy-in and described the Republican package as unprecedented. No Democrats supported the measure when it passed the Senate 51 to 48 in an early vote on Thursday. Final passage in the House was delayed for several hours as Republicans wrestled with their response to Democrats' push for a vote on the release of Jeffrey Epstein files.  The package cancels about $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and nearly $8 billion for a variety of foreign aid programs, many designed to help countries where drought, disease, and political unrest endure. The cancellation of $1.1 billion for the CPB represents the full amount it is due to receive during the next two budget years. The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.  The corporation distributes more than two thirds of the money to more than 1500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to the National Public Radio and Public Broadcasting Service to support national programming. Democrats were unsuccessful in restoring the funding in the Senate. Lawmakers with large rural constituencies voiced a particular concern about what the cuts to public broadcasting could mean for some local public stations in their state."}], "keywords": ["Trump"], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Aaron McLaughlin": null, "Adrian Broadus": null, "Al Roker": null, "Alan Greenspan": null, "Albert Bourla": null, "Alexander Bolton": null, "Alice Barr": null, "Amanda Mull": null, "Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Andy_Harris": null, "Angie Lassman": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Anne-Marie Hordern": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Ben Bernanke": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill Ferries": null, "Bill Pulte": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brian_Moynihan": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caleb Silver": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Camila Bernal": null, "Camila Brunel": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Dan Whitehead": null, "David Gurra": null, "David Weston": null, "Department for Education Spokesperson": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": "President Trump celebrates the House's approval of the spending cuts package, particularly the reduction in funding for NPR and public broadcasting, which he believes is politically biased and wasteful.

We're feeling really good about the business. We had a plan to re-accelerate growth and we delivered on that plan. And engagement, which we view as our best proxy for member happiness, because when people watch more they stick around longer, so that's retention.  Ted Sarandos spoke on the Netflix earnings call. Netflix shares have nearly doubled over the past year. Its market value tops $500 billion, making Netflix worth more than Disney, Comcast and Warner Brothers Discovery combined.  Nathan, Apple is losing more top talent. Meta Platforms has hired away a pair of key artificial intelligence researchers from the iPhone maker. Sources say the move comes shortly after the social networking giant poached their former boss from Apple. And Karen, President Trump's expected to announce policy guidelines for artificial intelligence calling for easing regulation and expanding energy sources for data centers.  The Trump administration's AI action plan will be largely focused on messaging limited to executive branch actions. It will reflect the administration's efforts to promote the adoption of U.S. artificial intelligence globally.  Nathan, the total market cap of crypto assets has surged past four trillion dollars for the first time. It follows a sweeping push on Capitol Hill to regulate the sector and Bloomberg's Michael Barr reports. The House passed the first federal legislation to regulate stable coins backed by President Donald Trump and Republicans. The Senate passed it earlier. Supporters say the legislation imposes federal or state oversight on dollar linked tokens and could unlock faster and cheaper forms of payment.  It could also bring legitimacy to a $265 billion market. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters, warn that the new stablecoin regulatory regime won't do enough to protect consumers. They say it could lead to pressure for government bailouts if issuers of the digital tokens fail.  Michael Barr, Bloomberg Radio. All right, Michael, thank you. More changes are coming to Paramount Global's CBS network. You'll notice them if you stay up for it. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is going to air its last episode in May of next year. CBS says it is purely a financial decision. It comes days after Colbert condemned Paramount's settlement of President Trump's lawsuit over a 60-minute story. In his first show back from vacation, Colbert called it, quote, a big fat bribe.  Paramount is in the process of being acquired by Skydance Media.

John Stashever, Bloomberg Sports. Karen, Ethan.  Coast to coast on Bloomberg Radio, nationwide on Sirius XM, and around the world on Bloomberg.com and the Bloomberg Business App. This is Bloomberg Daybreak. Good morning, I'm Nathan Hager, bringing you a conversation now with the president of the San Francisco Fed, Mary Daly. She sat down with Bloomberg's Michael McKee at the Rocky Mountain Economic Summit in Victor, Idaho. They talked about the possibility of rate cuts, recent pressure on Chairman Powell, and the impact of tariffs on the economy. Let's listen in.  For me, what is really important is looking at the incoming information, how close we are. I think one of the polls said, you know, we're really close. We have an economy that's working. We have a solid growth. We have a solid labor market. You know, the consumers are spending, but they're, you know, making their way in their families. Ultimately, what is still bothersome is  not we haven't achieved price stability. And, you know, I define price stability this way. I do think it's sort of an ethos part. It's when people don't have to worry about inflation. When I go out and ask people across the 12th District, across the country, what's your top worry, and they stop saying inflation, well, then that's going to be a victory because they suffered for too long. And remember, inflation's like the  the largest tax people pay. It's an unpredictable tax, you're on a treadmill, you earn well, you invest in your business, and inflation erodes your well-being. So I think ultimately that's what we have to think about, and that's really enough to think about, frankly, and that's where my focus is. So other things are not distracting us from our core missions, and our core missions, as we all know, have come from Congress."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 754.242, "text": " Essentially, you're saying we are going to remain focused on inflation. We're not going to consider cutting rates until we are sure inflation's coming."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 761.652, "text": "I did not say that."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 764.596, "text": "Okay. I'm putting words in her mouth to make it easier for the headline writers."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 768.482, "text": "I know that, and so that's why I said I did not say that, so that they understand the next part of that. No, seriously, I think right now when I look at the economy and policy, I see them as both in a good place.  But when I look out, we really have interest rates for a significant number of years now in restrictive territory. And what we have is an underlying economy that is responding to those higher interest rates. You have growth slowing. The frothy labor market that was pervasive after the pandemic has now moved to a more sustainable place. People are getting jobs, but firms are finding it easier to find workers and, importantly, keep workers.  so that they're not constantly on that, you know, revolving door of train a worker, the worker leaves. So I think those are all good positions. Then we have inflation coming down, and if we extract or move away from just the goods price inflations, which do show, those numbers have been showing and certainly showed in this week's print, the effect of tariffs, some of those being passed through. But if you look at the other  areas of inflation, you just don't see that inflation is pushing back up. You see it gradually going down. And housing services inflation, which has long been elevated, has been coming down over this year. Services inflation without housing has been coming down slowly, but coming down. So I see these as the result of the policy that we have in place, but at some point,  If you hold the economy too tight, the reins, we're in horse country, if you hold the bridle too tight, you actually end up stopping. And if you stop, then you take the problem people did have, which was inflation, and turn it into a problem that they don't have, which is the labor market."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 868.448, "text": "Could you explain to this audience, and of course the guy at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue if he's listening, how you put all that together and decide when do interest rates come down?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 878.763, "text": " Well, there's always been three scenarios that were possible. So the first scenario was that we'd get the tariff effect and it would spill over into all other sectors. So if the price of a tariffed good goes up, then your person cutting your hair, since we were talking about barbers earlier, raises his or her prices. And suddenly you've got spillover. That would make it more persistent. We haven't seen any evidence that that's occurring.  And I think that the house price inflation, the house services inflation and the services inflation coming down reassures you that we're not getting that persistent component. So then there's two other scenarios. One is that you get the tariff effect, but it's relatively contained and becomes a one-off. And the second is you just don't see much of the effect because what happens is that as the tariffs settle into whatever level they're going to be,  you know, firms who are importing from other countries say, you take half, I'll take half to the country. Then down the supply chain or the production chain, you're splitting it all the way. And so by the time it hits consumers, it's a more muted impact than what is the announced tariffs. You know, one of the pieces of evidence we have for that is that the effective tariff rate as of  Last week was calculated around 16%, but tariff revenue is only 8%. So that tells you there's some splitting. There's some leakages, some workarounds. Companies are very innovative. They're figuring out other ways to do things. And, you know, this is a global shock. And so companies across the globe are figuring it out.  This is Bloomberg Daybreak, your morning podcast on the stories making news from Wall Street to Washington and beyond.

And indeed, someone did run against you. But something that helped you survive was an open primary and ranked choice voting.  And this all ties together to what you were just talking about, about working across the aisle and sort of finding ways to compromise. So ranked choice, Alaska's like one of the leading states, really the leading state right now on ranked choice voting. And they just chose to keep it in this latest election, which was quite heated.

We have seen that very immediately in Alaska. You mentioned the 2022 election. Ranked choice was in place.  We saw after all of that, I would have won without ranked choice, but having an open primary really did make a difference, and we see that. We see that so often where you have an individual that is having to run to the right or run to the left during a primary, and then when the general comes, it's like, okay, gotta recalibrate to the middle, and you have voters kinda looking and saying, well, wait a minute,  It seemed like back in the spring, you were in a different place on this. And now, your position has changed. Which one was the real you? And so I think if there's one thing that people, I think voters want, is authenticity with their elected officials.  Show me who you really are, or as close as you can. And so I think that between an open primary system and ranked choice, what you get are individuals who probably will be more comfortable in that middle area, less pressure to be in the far extremes because  You're coming from a state and a place where you know it's just the few that participate in those primaries that are basically making the determination.  of who wins these offices. I also liked it as a candidate because it says from day one, you are running as who you are. You're not kind of trying to cater to one group or one side or another. It's just kind of straight across. I think it's also, the rank choice part of it,  is also good from a candidate's perspective, because if I want people to want them to vote for me, and we talk about this in the book, I'm going to encourage that.

But give me your number two. And that in and of itself is something that says to me, OK, I better not trash talk the Democrat too much. Because if I do, I'm not going to get her  second place votes. And so there's a little bit of a strategy, I think, that goes on with it. And I will say, you know, there have been these articles written and the debates had about, well, ranked choice voting is just designed to, it's designed by the Democrats to get all the conservatives out.

It was really when I was defeated, as you've noted, by a Tea Party opponent who,  who presented himself at a time when we were seeing the Tea Party movement really just start to gain a toehold. For the political junkies that are here, the first casualty in the Senate was my friend Bob Bennett, a great, great gentleman.  He'd been in the Senate for a long while. I thought he was pretty conservative, but he was not conservative enough for those in the Tea Party movement there in Utah. And he was defeated in his primary. And he gave me a warning. He said, Lisa, they're coming for you next. And I said, no, no, no. Bob, you don't know Alaska. We're fine. We're fine.  Ah, we were not fine.  And it was a combination, I think, of the movement taking hold, really kind of catching fire in a place like Alaska. But also, I do hold myself accountable for some of that defeat. It was 10 days before the election that my friend and mentor,  Ted Stevens, who had been in the Senate for 40 years, he went down in a plane crash in Alaska along with six others. I lost six friends in that crash. The state went into a period of literal mourning.  went dark with my campaign, as I rightly should. But it was a hard time personally, because there was so much that you needed to do, but out of respect for this extraordinary leader and all those who perished in that crash, the right thing to do was what we did. And there were consequences to that.  And that resulted in a loss. And so it's one of those where you say, I can't say the election was stolen. It was not. I lost that primary. And any good incumbent or candidate would say, OK, you lost.  You're packing. And I said it. I said it. I said I was ready to get my season ski pass at Alyeska.

They were, you know, none of your damn business party. They were Alaskans that returned me. And so I've been challenged on this. You know, you don't necessarily toe the party line.

And then you agonized over this decision for a long time, but you could have just called me and I probably could have told you how you were gonna vote.  But there was a temperament issue there, and I know you well enough to know what you think. I mean, you're a lawyer, a trained lawyer. You went to law school before entering politics. You had a whole life before you entered politics.  You also were probing, of course, quite thoughtfully and carefully what it meant to have Christine Blasey Ford come forward and talk about her allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. Your office was inundated with calls. You were crushed by throngs of people in the halls of Congress. You were meeting upon groups of women who were telling you their own stories of surviving sexual assault. You even talk about your own personal experiences in the book.

Justice Kavanaugh clearly had the legal background. There's kind of a list of things that you go through when you're considering a judicial nominee, and when you're considering a nominee to the highest court in the land, you have to take this role of advice and consent very, very carefully, right?  And so I did agonize over it because I saw, just as you have shared here, there was an issue with judicial temperament.  People need to know when you're going before a court that the judge is going to be able to be not only free from bias, but really keep their own emotion and personal views certainly below the bench, right?  That was one aspect of it. But as I share in the book, I wanted to make sure that Justice Kavanaugh also had an awareness that what the country was going through as a consequence of these hearings, watching Christine Blasey Ford give her testimony,  And then seeing this movement, I mean, it was the Me Too movement where you had women that were stepping forward with personal stories of their own that perhaps they had not shared previously because they felt they would not be heard.  or they had shared it, and it went nowhere. And so there was this kind of a confluence where it was not just about the qualifications of a nominee, but it was what had been evoked among so many women in this country, all coming to the surface at the same time.  And so I asked for a one-on-one meeting with Justice Kavanaugh and had a very direct conversation, which to this day I deeply appreciate. But I came to the conclusion that he was not aware of what  what so many were going through. And you can't say, well, you are a man who has not have lived experiences. But to have a level of awareness as to what the country was experiencing was what I was trying to evoke from him.  It is, to this day, one of the decisions that I have made that has brought about as much introspection, reflection, truly, in terms of due diligence, and trying to  to make the right decisions for the right reason, that was one of the most challenging ones in my career."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 60, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 2855.382, "text": " I want to talk about loneliness now, because in the early days of the Senate, you had a group of women who would get together.

What was going on, this was, you know, many of the federal employees that were probationary had been told, you're fired, you're out of here. And then they were kind of brought back on because of,  legal challenges. There was great uncertainty. We'd already seen a significant round of rifts, reduction in forces, and so that was a challenge. There was a pause on everything that was going on. Now keep in mind,  Alaska has more federal employees per capita than just about any state outside of Maryland and Virginia. And it's not because we asked for it. It's because we have 60% of our lands that are federal lands.  17% of our population is Alaska Native. So you have IHS and BIA. You have more national parks, more acres of Forest Service land. And so how more veterans, we've got all of our military installations. So we see a lot of federal employees, but we also see a lot of federal programs. And so when everything is in limbo,  you can't get information about whether or not the grant that you have to help you with your woman's shelter is going to come through so that you can make payroll for the next month, and you're not sure whether you can even take in any more women to the shelter, and you don't know where to go.  you go to your senator. And there was so much anxiety with everything that was happening in the state. It was palpable. I'd walk through the airport, and people were like, can you help me with, we've got a small hydro project down in Southeast, and we've been fighting for years to get it, we have the money, and now we can't get anyone to return a phone call. It was,  It was a time for us in our office where there was nobody that was not literally working casework around the clock trying to get answers. And everyone was afraid. Is this going to be the end of what I'm working on?  What's happening next? Am I going to be able to keep my job? And that's all I kept hearing. And I didn't have any answers because we were trying to get answers as well from the administration. Everybody was kind of drinking out of a fire hose. And sometimes when there is great anxiety, the most helpful thing that you can do is just listen and let people know that I am listening to you and I'm going to try to help.  But I also had to acknowledge that I get it, because I'm hearing it from everyone. I am hearing that you are afraid. And so in that room, and if you watch the video clip that was out there, I think somebody just literally took a handheld, but it was, I paused. I paused.  few seconds, maybe more. And I said, look, we're all afraid because of the uncertainty. And I didn't say because of the uncertainty. I just said, we're all afraid. That was that viral moment. And then I went and I went on further.  Because in addition to all that kind of uncertainty, what we are also seeing at the same time was we were seeing things coming out of the administration that, in my view, were absolutely unprecedented. When through an executive order, you have literally a blacklisting of law firms because of who they had represented  post-January 6th. To me, that, if that isn't retaliation, I don't know what other word to call it. And so I was speaking truth to what we had all seen, and yet it hadn't been, it hadn't been expressed, um,  Outwardly, it certainly hadn't been expressed by a Republican, and so I said what I felt needed to be said, and that was that viral moment."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 68, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 3381.494, "text": " How do you get, I'm just gonna add on a little quick addendum to this, and we'll get back to the audience questions.

The House gave final approval to President Donald Trump's request to claw back about $9 billion for public broadcasting and foreign aid early today. Here is a statement there from  House Speaker Mike Johnson. He says President Trump and House Republicans promised fiscal responsibility and government efficiency. Today, we're once again delivering on that promise. This package eliminates $9 billion in unnecessary and wasteful spending at the State Department, USAID, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The American people will no longer be forced to fund politically biased media and more than $8 billion in outrageous expenses overseas.  While Republicans continue to deliver real accountability, restore fiscal discipline, and protect taxpayer dollars, Democrats continue to defend waste, fraud, and abuse. This isn't the end, it's the beginning. We look forward to passing additional rescissions bills throughout the 119th Congress. And again, you are taking a live look right now at the United States Capitol.  The vote marked the first time in decades that a president has successfully submitted such a decision's request to Congress, and the White House suggested it won't be the last, as we just heard there from Speaker Johnson. Some Republicans were uncomfortable with the cuts, yet supported them anyway, wary of crossing President Trump or upsetting the agenda. The House passed the bill by a vote of 216 to 213. It's now going to President Trump for his signature.  to give you both sides of the aisle here. Opponents voiced concerns not only about the programs targeted, but about Congress and its spending powers to the executive branch as investments approved on a bipartisan basis were being canceled on party line votes. They said previous rescission efforts had at least some bipartisan buy-in and described the Republican package as unprecedented. No Democrats supported the measure when it passed the Senate 51 to 48 in the early morning hours  On Thursday, yesterday, final passage in the House was delayed for several hours as Republicans wrestled with the response to Democrats' push for a vote on the release of Jeffrey Epstein files. Now, this package cancels about $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and nearly $8 billion for a variety of foreign aid programs, many designed to help countries where disease and political unrest endure.  The cancellation of $1.1 billion for the CPB represents the full amount it is due to receive during the next two budget years. The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. The corporation distributes more than two thirds of the money to more than  15-hundred locally operated public television and radio stations with much of the remainder assigned to the National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service to support national programming. Democrats were unsuccessful in restoring the funding in the Senate. Lawmakers with large rural  that's what we're going to do. We're going to do what we can to make sure that our rural constituencies voice particular concern about what the cuts to public broadcasting could mean for some local public stations in their state. So once again, bringing you this news that happened very early this morning here, Congress now sending this $9 billion spending cuts package to President Trump's desk. We'll keep an eye on that.

So you've mentioned trench coats, that revival, that kind of turnaround is hinging on that kind of return to Britishness.

So that's quite positive. That's pushed up the stock higher this morning. There are obviously some negatives as well. So the CEO said that people were still not really shopping in the UK and he said that obviously tariffs and the uncertainty that comes with that were still a big headwind.

The whip is recognized. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. After much debate, we can now codify President Trump's effort to prevent the development of a Central Bank Digital Currency, or CBDC, and ensure that the United States' digital currency policy remains in the hands of the American people and not the administrative state.  I'm proud to have my legislation, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, being considered on the House floor for a vote today. This bill is straightforward. It prevents unelected Washington bureaucrats from creating a financial surveillance tool that, if not done correctly, will fundamentally alter the lives of every American.  Unlike decentralized digital assets, a CBDC is a digital form of sovereign currency that is designed, issued, and monitored by the federal government. It is government-controlled, programmable money that, if designed without the privacy protections of cash, this could give the federal government the ability to surveil and restrict Americans' transactions and monitor every aspect of our daily lives.  In other words, every dollar you spend, where you spend it, who you spend it with, would all be visible to and tracked by the watchful eyes of Washington. There would be no cash, no anonymity, no space for private financial decision-making.  This isn't an inconceivable concept. We have already seen examples of governments developing these types of tools and using them to weaponize their financial systems against their citizens. The Chinese Communist Party employs a CBDC that is being used to monitor and restrict citizen spending. The data is being used to develop a social credit system that rewards or punishes individuals based on their spending behavior.  In Canada, the former Trudeau administration demonstrated the power of federal financial surveillance and control when it froze the bank accounts of hundreds of truckers protesting the COVID vaccine mandate in 2022. Surely, this totalitarian surveillance tool would never take root in the United States.  However, that assumption would be wrong. This is not a theoretical risk. It is a very real and very dangerous precedent. Under the Biden administration, financial surveillance was a core tenet of President Biden's policy agenda. In 2022, President Biden issued an executive order placing urgency on CBDC research and development.  Moreover, the agency reports created under that executive order made it clear that the previous administration was eager to create a CBDC and was willing to trade Americans' right to financial privacy for a CCP-style surveillance tool.  Our bill, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, prevents future administrations from weaponizing this technology against the American people, while ensuring that any development of digital money reflects our American values of privacy, individual sovereignty, and free market competitiveness. If not designed to be open, permissionless, and private,  private with a capital P, resembling cash, a government-issued CBC is nothing more than a well-in surveillance tool that will be used to erode the American way of life. The federal government has no business monitoring Americans' daily financial lives. We don't need or want a state-run digital dollar with Chinese Communist Party characteristics.  We need to protect the core principles that make this country exceptional. Liberty, limited government, and the right to privacy.  We are on the verge of the next game-changing technological evolution, and we must embrace this push for a more developed digital economy. In doing so, we cannot jeopardize who we are as Americans, and this bill is designed to ensure just that. I want to thank Chairman Hill and Chairman Stile for their tireless work and advocacy on this issue, in addition to the 135 members of Congress who have joined as co-sponsors of our legislation.  I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time."}], "keywords": ["Trump"], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Aaron McLaughlin": null, "Adrian Broadus": null, "Al Roker": null, "Alan Greenspan": null, "Albert Bourla": null, "Alexander Bolton": null, "Alice Barr": null, "Amanda Mull": null, "Andrew Ball": null, "Andrew Ross Sorkin": null, "Andy Jacobs": null, "Andy_Harris": null, "Angie Lassman": null, "Ann Mileti": null, "Anna Giratelli": null, "Anne-Marie Hordern": null, "Austin Westphal": null, "Becky Quick": null, "Ben Bernanke": null, "Bill Fares": null, "Bill Ferries": null, "Bill Pulte": null, "Bill_Gage": null, "Brian Tyler Cohen": null, "Brian_Moynihan": null, "Brody Ford": null, "Brooke Rollins": null, "Caleb Silver": null, "California Attorney General Rob Bonta": null, "Camila Bernal": null, "Camila Brunel": null, "Carol Masser": null, "Caroline Hepker": null, "Caroline Hyde": null, "Charles Crane": null, "Charlie Billett": null, "Chris Cuomo": null, "Chrissy Newton": null, "Christy": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Claudia Sheinbaum": null, "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser": null, "Dan Bongino": null, "Dan Whitehead": null, "David Gurra": null, "David Weston": null, "Department for Education Spokesperson": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Dr. Marty McCary": null, "Dr. Phil": null, "Ed Ludlow": null, "Elizabeth Ricci": null, "Elizabeth Warren": null, "Elon Musk": null, "Geetha Raghunathan": null, "Geetha Ranganathan": null, "George Solis": null, "George Solis, NBC News": null, "Greg Gutfeld": null, "Hallie Jackson": null, "Hannah_Taylor": null, "House Speaker": null, "House Speaker Mike Johnson": null, "Howard": null, "Ian King": null, "Jackie DeValles": null, "James Woolcock": null, "Jay Powell": null, "Jay_Powell": null, "Jensen Wang": null, "Jo Mays": null, "Joe Kernan": null, "Joe_Taylor": null, "Joel Wertheimer": null, "John": null, "John Hazen White": null, "John Max": null, "John Stashower": null, "John_Molinar": null, "Johnny Appleyard": null, "Jordan Fabian": null, "Josh Hawley": null, "Josh Wingrove": null, "Julie Sorkin": null, "Julien_Pontus": null, "Karen Bass": null, "Karen Moskow": null, "Kash Patel": null, "Kat Dibb": null, "Kate Snow": null, "Katie Hubbard": null, "Katie Kramer": null, "Katya Dmitrieva": null, "Keir Simmons": null, "Kelly O'Donnell": null, "Ken Langone": null, "Kennedy": null, "Kevin Hassett": null, "Kevin Warsh": null, "Kristen Welker": null, "Kristi Noem": null, "Kurt Wagner": null, "Kyle Schwarber": null, "Lara Trump": null, "Larry Kudlow": null, "Laura": null, "Laura_Davison": null, "Laura_Trump": null, "Lawrence_Jones": null, "Leslie Picker": null, "Lisa Murkowski": null, "Liz Speaks": null, "Maria": null, "Mark Carney": null, "Mark Winterhoff": null, "Mark Zuckerberg": null, "Mark_Rutte": null, "Marty_McCary": null, "Mary Nicola": null, "Maxwell Alejandro Frost-McCally": null, "Mayor Thompson": null, "Megan Kinsella": null, "Megan Myung Won Lee": null, "Micah Hanks": null, "Michael Barr": null, "Michael Dykes": null, "Michael McKee": null, "Michael Rappaport": null, "Mike Johnson": null, "Mills Hayes": null, "Nancy Reagan": null, "Natalie Lung": null, "Nathan Hager": null, "Nicholas Burns": null, "Nick Pope": null, "Pam Bondi": null, "Paul J Davies": null, "Paul Morrow": null, "Paul Volcker": null, "Pete Alonso": null, "Phil Murphy": null, "Priscilla Azevedo-Rocca": null, "Priya Sridhar": null, "Rob Parker": null, "Robin Klosowitz": null, "Rohit Chopra": null, "Romain Bostic": null, "Rosie Rios": null, "Russell Vought": null, "Ryan Graves": null, "SPEAKER_00": "The speaker introduces the \u201cAnti-CBDC Surveillance State Act\u201d and argues that CBDCs could become financial surveillance tools controlled by the federal government.

The criticism over the construction has coincided with President Trump's increasing hostility towards the Fed chair as the president lobbies for lower interest rates.

The wages were made yesterday despite the market moving in the opposite direction after a hotter-than-expected inflation print. Bloomberg's James Warcock has the story.  This gamble rests on the labour market. Although this week saw UK inflation rising to 3.6%, yesterday's jobs data saw the number of employees on payroll drop and vacancies fall for the 36th consecutive month. So although options trading is anonymous, the thinking behind the \u00a31.5 million in debts is likely the Bank of England will have to address Britain's cooling labour market.

Labour MP and leader of the House of Commons Lucy Powell says that the whole situation has been uncomfortable.  There are many, many questions here about how this data leak happened, what were the consequences of it, what actions were taken as a result, and what procedures and policies have been put in place to make sure that that would never happen again. Lucy Powell and other members of the government are facing calls for a public inquiry. The Shadow Defence Secretary, James Cartlidge, apologised on behalf of the former Conservative government, which was in power when that leak was discovered.  The US Commerce Department will impose anti-dumping tariffs of 93.5% on imports of Chinese graphite, which is a key battery component. The new duties will be a blow to battery manufacturers as they add to existing rates, making the effective tariff 160%. Tesla and its key battery supplier, Japan's Panasonic, were among companies pushing to block the new tariffs. The new charges are set to make the global electric vehicle supply chain even trickier.

So, those are the markets. In a moment, we'll bring you the latest on the shifting sands around the outlook now for US interest rates.  plus why the G20 in South Africa has become a chance for a bit of diplomatic speed dating. Before that, though, another story has caught my attention today. AI agents are about to go mainstream. Now, this is the artificial intelligence software that can complete multi-step tasks for users with quite minimal supervision. OpenAI is going to roll out these new chat GPT options  that basically do more than just research. They browse, type and click on the internet for you so they can streamline your sort of personal and professional life. It does mean you have to pay for them if you use ChatGPT Pro Plus and Team. This according to Bloomberg's Rachel Metz who's been writing about this. Microsoft and rival Anthropic are also focusing on this AI agents. It's the next step in AI. Sal Altman has in the past called it the next giant breakthrough.  I was pretty dubious about getting sucked into another kind of time-consuming internet world, maybe akin to social media. But actually, I've started to see some productivity gains from AI. So, I wonder exactly what the capabilities of AI agents are really going to be. We're going to find out pretty soon. There are also some warnings though about safety and security risks that could increase with them. You do still have to give them apparently permission to make any purchases if they do get to that point for you. But it's a really interesting piece.  that Rachel's written about exactly when you'll get your hands on these AI agents. I'm going to put a note and a link to that story in our show notes for you. Now, let's think about the Federal Reserve. Christopher Wallace saying that policymakers should cut interest rates by 25 basis points this month to support the US labour market. Joining me now is our MarketsLive strategist Mark Cranfield on this story.  Good morning, Marks. The next Fed meeting is the 29th to the 30th of July in Washington. What data is Waller pointing to to support a rate cut?  He favours the labour market, saying that it is not quite as strong as it seems to be on the surface, that there's underlying issues there and that wages growth is helping to keep inflation down as well. So, he sees that as being a bigger risk than some of his colleagues do. So, he's very focused on that part of it. It's yet another signal to investors that there's quite a split within the Fed thinking at the moment. He's not the only one who thinks there should be  early interest rate cuts. Mary Daly also says the Fed shouldn't wait too long. But then, of course, we've also heard some people this week saying that patience is the best way to go and they're not ready. So, should be a pretty lively meeting behind closed doors later in the month.  Although are we getting to the point where we have to ask about where the policymakers' comments are entirely focused on the economics? Remember only yesterday, President Trump speculating about firing Jerome Powell. Powell's had to defend the Fed's spending on renovations and he's still under pressure. How do markets see that?  I think markets traders have been thinking that way for a few weeks already. I think if they weren't concerned that there was some politicking going on and that Jerome Powell was under extreme pressure from outside sources, you wouldn't have the betting markets giving any odds at all on Jerome Powell leaving before the end of his term as it is.  I think at one stage this week we had 40% odds that Jerome Powell would not finish his term, which seems quite incredible when you think that he is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. So, the fact that traders are even willing to make bets on the fact that we may have a different Fed Chairman, that really just shows how seriously they're having to take that. It's also being reflected  in the value of the U.S. dollar and the shape of the U.S. yield curve, those are also things which move in relation to that. I get the sense that traders don't want to go all out on it yet. It still feels like a slightly a remote risk, but it is no longer something which they can't pay any attention to at all. They are giving it some credence.  Okay. Mark, thank you so much for being with us this morning. Our Markets Live stash is Mark Cranfield. So, some food for thought there on the Fed. Now, let's think about South Africa. The Finance Minister, Enoch Godungwana, has told Bloomberg that the group of 20 finance ministers and central governors who are meeting near Durban in South Africa are close to a deal on a communique. Of course, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Scott Besant, has not been at that gathering.  and the US tariff war has overshadowed it. Joining us now from the G20 event in South Africa is our Europe correspondent Oliver Crook. Ollie, good morning. President Trump's trade and tariff policies have been sending shockwaves through the global economy. So just firstly, what's the mood in South Africa?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs", "EU", "Japan"], "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 839.782, "text": " Yeah, not just the trade policy because, you know, there's been the whole debate about the Fed chair potentially being removed early. And there was this press conference that was given by Donald Trump just about two nights ago, actually, just minutes before I was going to sit down with the Norwegian finance minister. And I was just had this sort of the Norwegian Kroner up and that moved by a full percentage point right in the wake of all of these sort of  conversation. So it really sort of highlights this idea that the Trump administration with its trade war but also its sort of domestic policy and politics within the United States on the Fed chair are really having really large impacts across the world. You know the old adage about the dollar is our currency your problem very much holding the case. And it does cause some concerns about global financial stability which is exactly what I've been hearing with a number of the finance ministers that I've been speaking to over the last couple of days. We should also say there's been sort of some  interesting developments here on the side of the EU. A lot of these sort of big EU countries have also had a meeting yesterday with Canada South Korea and Japan all talking about tariff policy. And this is sort of going into some of the reporting that we have been doing on the concept that maybe if the United States continues to cause massive problems on trade around the world.  that these negotiations, that there could be a more formal alignment between not just the European Union and European countries, but potentially broader, something closer to the sort of G6 and that sort of coalition. And I spoke to one European finance minister who really does not believe that whatever we get in the next two weeks, whether it's, you know, 30% tariffs on the EU or continued negotiations or a deal, that that will be the end of the conversation, that those sort of larger coalitions need to be formalized in a certain way, potentially to deal with the United States well into the future."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 934.687, "text": " This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe, your morning brief on the stories making news from London to Wall Street and beyond.

The big change there, of course, would be Donald Trump coming into the White House in January. And we've got these exclusive photos that hammer home how dangerous some of these assaults are.  Two days ago, ICE pulled over a Honduran national in Oklahoma City. The guy refused to get out of the car. ICE tried to remove him from the car. The suspect took off with an ICE officer stuck in his car. These injuries in the photos are from an ICE officer being dragged across the road.

She says, we will prosecute those who dox ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law. These criminals are taking the side of vicious cartels and human traffickers. We won't allow it in America. And then as for the actual physical violence, here is the acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.  This individual was lawfully ordered deported from the country approximately four years ago. He was given the opportunity to leave. He had an ankle monitor on him. He wasn't being held in detention. He went ahead and cut that ankle monitor off, and he fled. He dragged our officer.  a couple hundred feet, causing multiple injuries. Luckily, he's going to be OK. But this is just one of the millions, hundreds of cases across the country of these individuals that have been ordered deported or have committed crimes in the United States, yet ICE is demonized because we're effectuating the law.  President Trump has given full authorization, full authority to these ICE officers and CBP officers to do whatever they need to do to protect themselves in situations like the one that we just talked about. But still, these violent assaults are being carried out against ICE officers. Back to you.  Yeah, and the crazy thing is, Peter, there's a push with 40 different AGs to get the masks off the ICE officers. A totally different perception of what ICE needs to do. And there is a bill kicking around in the Senate proposed by two Democrats, Cory Booker and Alex Padilla, that would unmask ICE agents. But I asked President Trump about that last week.

And what Trump is looking at this in talking to the farmers and his agricultural secretary is, as well as the meatpacking industry and hospitality, is let's try to work something out. Number one, there's got to be some type of fine. Number two, you can't get citizenship.  No amnesty. Yeah, it's called regularization or something. It's got to be summed up, but fine. And then you've got to have a voucher from your boss or a sponsor. So I think there might be something there. But in saying this, a third of maybe Donald Trump supporters go, absolutely no way. I don't want to hear anything. It's just a form of amnesty. Maybe Laura Ingraham feels that way. Charlie Kirk feels that way. I feel differently.

Today, Matt Finn leads our coverage live in Los Angeles with more on this now. Matt, good morning.  Good morning. Here in California, a bill aimed at preventing law enforcement from concealing their faces passed a key committee this week, one step closer to potentially becoming law. At the same time, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons says ICE agents are getting their names and personal information posted online along with death threats.

At the same time, some Democrats and anti-ICE activists want to make it easier to identify agents by prohibiting them from wearing masks. Only the bad guys wear masks. Why are they masked?  Who are these people? Fox News spoke to this ICE special agent who was shocked to find a photo of himself and his wife along with the small town where they live posted on a doxing website targeting agents. My wife is home a lot with my three kids and she doesn't have the ability to protect herself like I do. The doxing is costing their family emotionally and financially. We spent  close to $1,000 in additional cameras for various points of our home.

And Hugh, good to have you back here for some analysis. We heard from a few Democrats in the report there from Matt Finn. Here's more on the call to dox these ICE agents, make their information public. Watch here.  What we're seeing is ICE agents showing up in unmarked cars, masked, and then conducting warrantless arrests. This is not the 1930s. And every single one of them, no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes, will, of course, be identified. These ICE agents.  running around our communities like masked bank robbers. No other law enforcement agency in America runs around our communities masked. It's time that we unmask ICE. So that last point is really what they're pushing.

Congressman Swalwell is never going to win the spelling bee anywhere. And for people who can remember his three-month presidential campaign, they'll remember why it lasted three months. He had a lot of idiotic propositions. This is about the dumbest one. It is very now well documented that ICE agents have come under physical assault. There was a shooting at the Prairieland Detention Facility. It shot a Texas police officer, but it was an ICE facility.  There was shooting at the Camarillo and Carpinteria raids on the cannabis farms that were employing aliens who were not in the country legally and child labor. There have been documented weapons assaults. That doesn't even go to the bricks and to the rocks and to the punches and to the dragging that you just mentioned. It's all illegal under 18 U.S.C. 111. There are other statutes that make it an even greater felony if you actually shoot at, attempt to murder a federal agent. And California can pass any law that they want.  zero impact on federal law enforcement officials, including ICE agents. I don't think there's anybody watching who doesn't understand that, in the age of the Internet, anyone who is doxxed is, especially law enforcement, put at extraordinary risk by the fringe elements of our society. I go back to that attack in Texas. Twelve people assaulted a detention facility with firearms.  The FBI's most wanted list got the number one guy suspected of being involved in that yesterday. But I'm with Senator Kennedy. Every single person who assaults a federal officer or, indeed, a police officer of any sort ought to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Now, take a look at this exclusive video obtained by Fox. ICE arrested this week, Guatemala National,  David Cabrera, convicted of felony rape back in 2015, previously deported multiple times after multiple reentries, booked into Arlington County's detention center for a felony probation violation this year. Then, when an ICE detainer was denied, Arlington released him back to the streets, forcing ICE agents to track him down. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons tells me this puts his agents at greater risk.  This is the whole reason why sanctuary jurisdictions and communities just do not keep America safe. It lets criminals back on the street to re-offend again.

And then it has to be fed up the chain that there's just recurring at every level within first the military and then the task force that was trying to  help with the scheme and then they passed it up to the MOD itself. The MOD then had to pass it to number 10. You can just see the level of oh shit, oh shit, oh shit that would have happened in this and we have to do something about this. We have to stop this becoming a slaughter and a real concern of how do we make this safe? How do we, you know, we can't put Pandora back in the box but how do we make sure that we try and make this as safe as we can? I kind of get all of that.  But Harriet's completely right. And to explain why the Intelligence and Security Committee is different from other committees, yes, it's because people are security cleared and they're appointed, but their job is often secret anyway. So to make sure that MI5 and MI6 aren't off doing things around the world that we don't approve on and we don't believe in as a country, they investigate them, they hold them to account. They're almost like the board of directors. They're the governance of the stuff that the public's not allowed to see.  and they're the parliamentary oversight. So in terms of, they will know how good MI6's cyber defences are and whether there's been an attack or somebody's breached it and got in. We won't ever know that, even as members of parliament, even as members of the Privy Council, Harriet and I, won't know that because that's not our job to know it.

It announced that the conditions that initially led to the designation of that country, the ongoing conflict between Taliban and other insurgent groups,  and the extraordinary humanitarian conditions were essentially no longer so severe that it merited that designation. I guess to take a step back and talk a little bit about TPS, TPS is a status that the Secretary of Homeland Security can designate a particular country for based on certain conditions in those countries, particularly if the country is experiencing ongoing armed conflict, if there's a natural disaster, or if there's another extraordinary condition in the country.  If the secretary makes that conclusion, then he or she will designate the country for TPS, which allows individuals from those countries to live and work in this country for a particular set period of time. Secretary Mayorkas concluded that Afghanistan merited that determination back in 2022 and extended in 2023 based on those conflicts and the conditions in Afghanistan. And Secretary Norm at least purported to say that those conditions no longer existed.  Now, of course, our challenge, one of our arguments is in fact that that purported rationale for the decision is not the one that's actually motivating the actions here. Our argument is that this is a preordained decision as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reduce the number of nonwhite immigrants in this country. And that's the basis on which we have asked the fourth circuit to pause the DPS termination while the appeal plays out."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 177.1, "text": " Are you also arguing in this that what the Homeland Security Secretary determined, that there are improvements in security and economic situations and that Afghan nationals can return, are you arguing that that's factually incorrect?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 193.323, "text": "We're not making that specific argument in part because of some jurisdictional bars on what the courts are allowed to consider.  I think what we are is pointing to that the conditions in the country are not good, and this further supports the argument that the purported rationales that things have improved are not the actual ones. So it's that mismatch between what's actually going on in Afghanistan and the actions here that support our argument that even if things might have improved a little bit, that's not really the reason that she's doing that. And I will just note to this effect, you know, as part of the litigation here,  The administration had to produce an administrative record, which is all the things that were in front of the secretary when she made her decision. And in November of 2024, the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service, which is one of the entities that typically consults on these, concluded that, and I'm going to quote here,  Quote, Afghanistan's civilian population faces dire challenges, including a collapsing economy and health care system, ubiquitous food insecurity exacerbated by drought and widespread insecurity due to decades of armed conflict and insurgency that is entering a new danger phase. It also stated that the Taliban authorities violently target citizens and foster continued armed conflict and interethnic strife.  and that it imposed restrictions on education, employment, and other areas on women that foreclosed their ability to make meaningful participate in their country. So again, we're not necessarily challenging the underlying factual conclusion of what's going on here, but we're saying that these kinds of statements from the federal government itself demonstrate that there's really something else going on here."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 296.069, "text": " So, Maryland Federal Judge Theodore, so Federal Judge Schwong allowed your challenge to TPS to go forward, but he declined to halt the administration's policy and, you know, preserve TPS protections.

He concluded, as you said, that our challenge can go ahead, notwithstanding a couple of jurisdictional arguments that the defendants had raised. And he also concluded by pointing to things like the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service report that I just quoted, that we had plausibly alleged that the action taken with respect to Afghanistan is part of a broader policy to reduce the number of non-white immigrants in this country.  and to effectively terminate almost all TPS designations. But then he said we had not yet introduced enough evidence to sort of get over that likelihood of the success on the merits hump. And so there's some delta there in his mind that we hadn't yet demonstrated that we could get there. And he said, look, I'm going to allow this claim to go forward. You all can go into discovery and try and identify additional evidence that will support your claim here. But at this point, I'm not  going to enter relief. So we respectfully disagree with that part of Judge Chuang's ruling. We think that the allegations that we made here and the evidence before the court was sufficient to, at a minimum, temporarily pause the termination of Afghanistan's TPS designation while we get that discovery, while things play out. And that's sort of the similar request that we've made of the Fourth Circuit, is just to postpone this agency action while the appeal plays out.  And one thing I'll just note here, you know, Judge Chuang noted that other courts have entered preliminary relief of some sort in response to similar claims and similar amounts of evidence in the past in the first Trump administration and said, well, we hadn't produced enough evidence here. I think it's important to note that in those cases, the time between when the end of the TPS designation was announced and when it took effect was in most cases more than a year. So those parties had  you know, much more time to produce the kind of evidence that Judge Chuang is asking for. When we're asking for just this sort of temporary relief while things are playing out to their merits, we think that, first of all, the evidence that we have produced and the things that we've pointed to, like the thing from USCIS that I pointed you to, like some other statements from President Trump and Secretary Nome,  demonstrate that this is part of a preordained effort and demonstrate that we will likely succeed on the merits when we get there, especially as we get into discovery and produce more evidence in support of our argument."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 470.942, "text": "So the Fourth Circuit gave you an administrative stay for a week.

In the interim, the court has asked us to brief our request, formally called a postponement of agency action pending appeal.

And that followed another order in May that allowed the administration to end TPS protections for 350,000 Venezuelans. So is the Supreme Court likely to end TPS protections for Afghans as well?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 562.268, "text": "So I don't want to make too many predictions about exactly what the Supreme Court is going to do here. I will say that we're very confident in our case. And I'd just like to parse out those prior grants of, I think, stays of lower court's orders.  With respect to the Cuban, Haitians, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans, that was actually with respect to a parole program that had been adopted by the Biden administration. So it didn't involve temporary protected status. And I think, you know, sort of trying to extrapolate what the court said there and apply it here, I think is a very difficult thing. Similarly, with respect to the Venezuelan program, that was with respect to the temporary protected status.  But in that case, the arguments that were being made were different from the ones that are being made here. There, for example, the plaintiffs argued that Secretary Mayorkas, who had extended the TPS designation for Venezuela for about 18 months at the end of the Biden administration, and then Secretary Nome had revoked that extension. The plaintiffs there argued that Secretary Nome doesn't have that sort of authority.  We, by contrast here, are arguing that the reasons that were given were pretextual, that this was a preordained effort. Also, you know, I think there are extremely strong equities here, as Judge Chuang recognized in his decision. I mean, with Afghans in particular, we're talking about individuals who served our country. One of the members of CASA, who's our client here,  is a person named B.S. who faced death threats due to her work as an interpreter for international United States agencies. And she's fearful that if she's returned, she's going to be targeted by the Taliban if she goes back to Afghanistan. So, again, I think it's always a little bit of a hazardous proposition of guessing what the Supreme Court might do if we get there. But we think that we've got a very strong case and that what the court did with respect to Venezuela and with respect to the parole program doesn't shed all that much light on what it might do here."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 673.951, "text": " So can some of the Afghans that you're representing apply for special immigrant visas or asylum?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 683.401, "text": "Some may be able to, you know, but I think it's important to emphasize here that TPS is, you know, the bird in the hand.

Plus, the UK announcing plans to lower the voting age to 16, the dramatic shift in elections overseas, and could the US follow suit? Top story starts right now.  And good evening. We begin tonight with that surprise announcement from the White House. President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after noticing swelling in his legs. The condition is very common, especially in older Americans, causing blood to pool in the legs as a result of damage to the veins. Patients can experience swelling and pain, as well as discolored skin and other symptoms. But experts say the condition is not life-threatening.  These recent images of the president at a soccer match appearing to show swollen lower legs, a telltale sign of that condition. Despite these new developments, the president's physician insisting Trump is in excellent health and the White House confirming tonight he is not in any kind of discomfort.  The White House physician also addressing concerns about pictures like these, the president's hand-bearing bruises, as in this one in February, and some of those images, what appears to be makeup on the back of his hand. Trump's doctor saying it's caused by shaking so many hands, as well as the aspirin Trump takes regularly. Our Garrett Haake has been following this announcement from the White House. He leads us off tonight. Tonight, with recent photos showing what appear to be swelling in President Trump's ankles and bruises on his hands, this announcement from the White House.  In the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician with all of you today.  Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt reading a letter from the president's doctor revealing he's been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common swelling of the legs caused by blood pooling in the veins. In recent weeks, President Trump noted mild swelling in his lower legs. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition.  particularly in individuals over the age of 70. Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.  That physician letter, which the White House released, noting, an echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart failure, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified. Adding, the president remains in excellent health. The White House says the president, who's 79, is not experiencing pain or discomfort. Chronic venous insufficiency is actually quite common. It occurs in about 40% to 50% of adults older than the age of 70.  We spoke to vascular surgeon Dr. Lee Kirksey at the Cleveland Clinic. What are the symptoms typically? Those patients with mild symptoms may simply have occasional leg swelling. In the most severe instances, patients may experience discoloration or even skin ulceration.  As for the bruising on his hand, seen here during a meeting with French President Macron in February and appearing to be covered by makeup earlier this week, the White House physician saying it's consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, taken as a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen. Trump has repeatedly joked about the amount of handshaking his role requires, including after this lengthy receiving line during his recent trip to the Middle East."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 271.673, "text": "I shook more hands than any human being  is capable of doing."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 277.123, "text": "That was a long deal, and they were big people.

No compression socks, which is something some doctors recommend for this."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 297.581, "text": "The White House is bottom lining this as something they're sharing based on transparency, not any particular medical concern.  Tom. All right, Garrett, leading us off tonight from the White House. Thank you. To break down what the president's diagnosis means for his health, I want to bring in NBC News medical contributor Dr. Natalie Azar. So, Dr. Azar, thanks for being here. Let's start with the diagnosis. How common is this? How worried should the country be?  It's extraordinarily common, just like the vascular surgeon mentioned. I think about one in 20 adults, especially over the age of 50, can experience this. It's not a life-threatening condition. The only time that it can become a little bit more serious is if there is this prolonged edema and swelling in the legs. You can actually get a superficial infection there if you scratch or something like that. And people can also develop ulcers, which can be quite uncomfortable and take a long time to heal. But again, not a life-threatening condition.  So our NBC's medical unit tells us blood clots are a common cause of this condition, but the president's doctor is saying he doesn't have blood clots. So you can still get it even though you don't have blood clots? You sure can. So a deep vein thrombosis or a blood clot in the leg is the most common cause for venous insufficiency. But otherwise, sometimes people are born with what we call insufficient valves. This whole process is because, Tom, the blood is pooling in the leg and the valves that are supposed to keep blood going up to the heart are a little bit weak. That can happen also from distension or a little expansion of the vein size.  Let's move on to the hands now. You see the bruising it looks like appears to look like makeup is covering some of the bruises They're saying it's from taking aspirin and shaking hands. Yeah, is that normal? Is that? Of all the things that concern me in the world This is this probably the last thing in the world that would that would concern me as we get older our skin becomes more fragile our capillaries become more fragile they burst more easily and  So we know that skin as we get older is more likely to become bruised even just a little bump or something like that Plus the aspirin on top of it all and we know he has a very vigorous handshake So not something that I'd be concerned about as long as blood counts are normal But that's something that could happen just from shaking a lot of hands and taking yeah, technically I to me honestly I think it's more that he probably did bump a little bit too and and and the skin is so fragile there that that can happen  Okay, Dr. Azar, we thank you for explaining this. And again, no life-threatening emergency here, it sounds like. Dr. Azar, great to have you. Okay, we want to turn to the weather now and the life-threatening floods for parts of the Gulf Coast as tropical rains move in. It comes after days of relentless and deadly summer storms. NBC's George Solis is in New Orleans bracing for a deluge. Heavy rain and gusting winds slamming southwest Florida. In Missouri, dramatic flash flooding. This roadway completely washed out.  Kansas City seeing a month's worth of rain in just 24 hours. In New Jersey, officials say a deadly lightning strike at this archery club injured more than a dozen people, including a seven-year-old.  But Thomas, the club's treasurer, surviving and is now recovering from first-degree burns on his body. How lucky do you feel to be alive? I'm pretty lucky to be alive. Thomas and other witnesses at the range say there was no rain or thunder before the bolt struck, which authorities say killed 61-year-old Robert Montgomery. He was a really good guy. When I reached out for help, he was the first one that answered.  This week, a string of summer wild weather wreaking havoc across the country. Wisconsin slammed with at least seven reported tornadoes yesterday. Now, southern Louisiana and Mississippi brace for a bout of tropical turbulent weather that may dump as much as 10 inches of rain over several days.  Okay, George Solis joins us tonight from New Orleans. George, does it look too bad there? It doesn't look like it's raining at all, actually. It looks like a nice day there. There's still a threat, though, of some floods, possibly?  Yeah, that's right, Tom. The intermittent rain here in New Orleans has stopped, but just west of us in two parishes near the river, we are hearing reports of a new flash flood warning with reports of people actually reporting some high standing water. So it's a condition that we're going to keep monitoring very closely as more people are saying that that water there is starting to rise. This is a system that is stalled over there. So the potential for that flash flooding certainly increasing by the hour. Tom.  George Solis, thank you. An update tonight on that tragic death in Maine. Police today arresting a teenager in connection with the homicide of a 48-year-old paddleboarder whose body was found earlier this month. NBC's Erin McLaughlin has the latest on the investigation.

We're back in a moment with the MAGA backlash over the Jeffrey Epstein files showing no signs of letting up tonight. Vice President Mike Pence weighed in on what the White House is saying about appointing a special prosecutor.  Roblox now rolling out new features to make sure the popular social gaming platform is safe for teens, including AI, to scan video selfies. Will it work? Plus, a major new IVF breakthrough in the UK. Doctors confirming the births of eight healthy babies conceived using DNA from three parents. What it could mean for the future of IVF worldwide.  We're back now with the growing divide between President Trump and his MAGA base over the release of the Epstein files. The White House today saying the president will not recommend a special prosecutor to review the handling of the case against Jeffrey Epstein, a request from influential far-right voices. Listen to what Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt had to say in today's White House briefing.  The president would not recommend a special prosecutor in the Epstein case. That's how he feels. The Democrats had control of this building, the White House, for four years, and they didn't do a dang thing when it came to transparency in regards to Jeffrey Epstein and his heinous crimes.  And now former Vice President Mike Pence is making his thoughts on the issue known. Pence in an interview to CBS News saying, the time has come for the release of all records related to Jeffrey Epstein. I want to bring in Mark Caputo, Axios White House reporter who has the latest. Mark, as you know, Mike Pence has no reason to support or say anything great about President Trump. Still some bad blood there. You've done a lot of reporting on President Trump and the MAGA movement.  According to your sources, I mean, what gives here, right? Is it because of what the president and Pam Bondi had said on the record? Is this what it is and it's such a huge issue for the MAGA base?  I think what gives here is eventually there's going to be some sort of independent, outside or quasi-inside-outside group or person or council who's going to look at these documents and is going to do a review. Notably, what Caroline Levitt, in that clip you just played, said, there's going to be no special prosecutor.  Well, that doesn't mean there's not going to be a special counsel or there's not going to be a special master or some sort of special review. I think that's being left open. The president, his messaging hasn't been firmly consistent on saying we're done, case closed. Instead, he's saying, well, maybe Bondi should release files if they're credible. The door has been left open. The pressure is so intense that I imagine eventually something's going to give.  Yes, something gives though, but will that be enough? Some type of independent review versus releasing the documents. I mean, they've released everything they can on the JFK thing and people are still like, it's not enough, the conspiracy is still there.  Well, number one, you can't release everything. Let's remember that some of the documentation is grand jury testimony and evidence. And in grand juries, these are deliberations and discussions that happen behind closed doors. And they're not rebuttable. What does that mean? If someone were accusing you of a crime and said that, oh, Tom robbed a grocery store and did all of these terrible things, your lawyers, your defense counsel, your people are not in there to deny it.  And if that stuff were just released to the public, well, people would think that you might be a robber. And that's just not how grand jury works, how grand juries work. And so all of that stuff can't be released. All of the files can't be released. Now, as for the JFK records, which I've done extensive reporting on,  And 62 years later, that stuff is still coming out. But I think, to your point, what you're raising is, there is a disconnect so far in the White House's messaging. On one hand, Donald Trump's administration gets credit for what it has done, which is demand that all of these JFK records finally be released after a process, but nevertheless released. And on the other hand, it's not really doing that with the Epstein files. Now, yes, they're different cases.  However, I just have reason to believe, listening to what they're saying and listening to how they're saying it, that eventually something more is going to happen. But Mark, what I was actually... Why that's going to happen, I don't know. Yeah, what I was getting at too is that if the crowd is conspiracy theory minded, regardless of how much you give them, they want to believe the conspiracy, some of them. You could give them everything. They're still going to believe that something was left out. I just, I don't know if this is a battle the White House can win.  Oh, probably not. Understand that the Epstein case is tied into these sort of religious archetypes that surfaced in the QAnon conspiracy theory about a cabal of global pedophile vampires who rape children and harvest their blood.  And so the likelihood that those folks are going to believe that all the truth is being told is pretty slim. Nevertheless, I think it's a false choice to have to decide between, OK, the people who are going to believe that sort of thing and then sort of the average rational man or rational person standard. There is still more information to be gone through and to be released. And it's in that space that the White House is going to try to operate. But again, this has released or reached the level of sort of religious belief.  If you took a time machine back to ancient Greece and you told people that Zeus didn't exist or that Helios doesn't really carry a chariot of the sun across the sky, they wouldn't believe you. But nevertheless, the truth matters and the full truth or a semblance of it hasn't come out yet. And I do think that an effort to do that is going to be coming relatively soon, just judging by what they're saying.  Yeah, no, I hear you. I hear you. How much, and do you have any reporting on this, or it might have just been coincidence, but I know you're a good reporter. The release of the health information today at sort of the top of that news briefing took a lot of people by surprise. Were you surprised by this?  To a degree, the other day when I was at the alligator Alcatraz event, I don't know, lost track of time with this White House because of the speed with which it moves, I noticed that the President's hand was covered with this odd substance.  I wondered if it was some sort of skin graft. It turns out it was makeup. And in the process of reporting that out and other people recently seeing the same thing, questions were raised. And then there were a number of reports that came out showing he had swollen ankles. And the volume of complaints and the volume of criticism and the volume of coverage and questions that reporters were asking finally essentially forced the White House to say, OK, here's the story with that. Now, it is a little rare for a White House to sort of proactively, especially the Trump White House,  say, here's the story about the president's health. But from what I'm told, they decided to sort of nip this in the ankle, so to speak, pardon the pun, and just come out and say, here's what we know so far. Mark Caputo, always great to have you on. Always great to talk to you. We thank you for coming on tonight.  We want to move on out of the gaming update designed to protect teens online. Roblox launching a slew of safety features on their platform, including an AI powered age verification system. The announcement coming three months after a 27-year-old kidnapped a 10-year-old that he met on the platform, according to police. NBC's Priya Sridhar with this one.  Tonight, the online gaming giant Roblox announcing new measures designed to keep kids and teenagers on its platform safe, driven by AI.  The massively popular platform draws approximately 100 million daily users who play games created by themselves and others. According to the company, more than half of those players are children under the age of 16. A group that CEO Dave Bozuki tells NBC News the company is focusing on keeping safe.  We have zero tolerance on roadblocks for any content that is not age appropriate. Our vision really is to go way beyond government or legislation and also go beyond an area that most social platforms aren't delving into. And that's this vulnerable teenage of 13 through 17.  Roblox rolling out a new age estimation technology which requires users to either take a selfie video which is analyzed by AI to estimate their age or to go through ID verification."}, {"keywords": ["Apple", "Trade"], "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1285.813, "text": "Roblox's new trusted connections with age estimation allows teens to unlock more open and engaging communication."}, {"keywords": ["Apple", "Trade"], "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1293.584, "text": " If a player is verified as older than 13, they will be allowed to utilize a trusted connections feature to communicate with other verified teens. Roblox has come under fire this year for child safety concerns, including in April when a 27-year-old California man was accused of kidnapping and unlawful sexual conduct with a 10-year-old girl he met on Roblox.  He spoke exclusively to NBC affiliate KGET in Bakersfield from behind bars. I should have been more careful.  It should have been more questioning when it came to having that person involved. The company says the new trusted connection chats will always be monitored for critical harm, like grooming. And parents will have the ability to see who their kids have listed as trusted connections and how much time they're spending on the platform. Child internet safety experts like Farida Shaheed says these measures are important to keeping the chats on the platforms where they can be monitored.  If communication is not allowed on Roblox and they don't have age verification and monitoring systems, they will be moving to less secure and safe platforms. Priya Sridhar joins us tonight. Priya, how do those features compare to those offered on different gaming platforms?  Yeah Tom. So another really popular online video game Minecraft has very similar safety measures in place. They actually require all of their users below the age of 16 to have an account that's linked to a Microsoft account that belongs to an adult. So that basically allows parents or guardians to see what their kids are doing in that online game a little bit more clearly. It also allows the parents to  basically force their kids to play in single-player mode instead of multiplayer mode, and it gives them the option to make their kids play in a mode where they're exposed to a little bit less violence, Tom. Okay, Priya, we thank you for that one. Top Story Returns will be rock.  The Trump administration taking new steps to potentially reopen the notorious prison Alcatraz, but doing so may be easier said than done. We'll take you inside its storied past. In our series, The Cost of Denial, how a North Carolina couple, denied over and over by their insurance company, finally turned to AI to write their appeal letter and got their cancer medications approved. But first, top stories, top moment, and a heartwarming surprise for one mom out for a breakfast with her eight-year-old daughter, Lani. The routine outing turned into a moment that Mom Jenny,  will never forget. Take a look.  Jenny tells Top Story that the gesture by her daughter meant so much to her and that she did pick up the tip for her daughter. Stay with us. We are back in such a great moment.  Back now with Top Stories News Feed. President Trump's Justice Department seeking no prison time for a former Louisville, Kentucky police officer involved in the botched raid of Breonna Taylor's home in 2020. A DOJ memo sent Wednesday requests time already served for Officer Brett Hankinson, who was convicted for violating Taylor's civil rights. Hankinson is currently facing a sentence of life in prison. In the raid, he fired 10 shots that did not hit anyone in the home. Sentencing for Hankinson is set for July 21st.  A sad update to a story we brought you earlier this month. A body found in Turks and Caicos was identified as a New York man who went missing two weeks ago. Forensic analysis confirming the body found July 5th is 51-year-old Patrick Terrence. An autopsy found no signs of trauma to his body, and police do not suspect foul play. Terrence was reported missing June 25th, last seen on security footage leaving his condo at night. And the Food and Drug Administration saying today Juul Labs can continue selling e-cigarettes.  This decision ending the multi-year review that left the products in limbo.

Now to Top Story's health check and a breakthrough form of IVF. Eight healthy babies were born in the UK through a groundbreaking technique which uses the DNA from three different people to prevent the passing down of deadly diseases. Here's a very simplified look at what's involved. A fertilized egg that includes the DNA of the mother and father and a separate fertilized egg from a donor. The mom and dad's genetic material is then injected into the donor's egg.  The new method prevents babies from being born with devastating diseases. While it's still in its early experimental phases and currently banned in the U.S., experts say it marks a huge step in the field. I want to bring in Dr. Lucky Sikhan. She's a double board certified OBGYN and fertility doctor. Dr. Lucky, thanks so much for being here. I know you're going to kind of walk us through this in a very simple manner. So this sounds like an incredible breakthrough.  It really is. It's a miracle. And it's specifically used to treat a very devastating category of hereditary diseases called mitochondrial disorders. Now, without getting too technical, I want to take you back to high school biology. Remember hearing the mitochondria as the powerhouse of the cell?  The mitochondria is in all of our cells, and it generates energy. And it's really important for all of our vital organs to function. And a lot of people don't realize this, but mitochondria is outside of the nucleus of the cell that has DNA that determines our personal traits that we get from our moms and our dads, right?  And outside of that, we have the mitochondria that makes the energy and it has its own DNA. Very small number of genes are encoded by that DNA. And what's interesting is we always get our mitochondrial DNA passed down from our moms. So if a mother carries a mutation in her mitochondrial DNA,  and she may have disease manifestations, she may be asymptomatic, but she will pass this on to 100% of her children. And it can be very severe in certain forms. It can affect your heart, your brain, your kidney, your liver, all of the major organs. And so this is the first time that we are able to now prevent this illness from being passed on without having to rely on a mother saying, I'm not gonna use my own DNA, I'm gonna use a donor egg.  So I got to ask you here, and I could be way off, but I'm sure some viewers have the same question. You have three parents now. Are there any traits from that third parent that will carry over to the child? No, I think three parent is actually a misnomer because you're really using the nuclear DNA from the intended parents, the mom and the dad who just want to do this procedure to have a healthy child. Only 1% of the DNA is actually coming from the donor when it comes  It's that energy DNA you were just talking about, right?"}, {"keywords": ["Apple"], "line": 31, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 2027.718, "text": "Exactly. It's the mitochondrial DNA. But there's no traits there?"}, {"keywords": ["Apple"], "line": 32, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2029.642, "text": "It does not represent anything that will determine traits. So why has it not been approved in the U.S. yet? Well, there's a ban here, and this has been longstanding because everyone is very concerned about the ethics of any sort of technology that involves being able to modify the genetics in a way that can be passed down to future generations.  And obviously there have been concerns about could this be a slippery slope and lead to designer babies. But I think it's really important to not conflate this amazing breakthrough with the concept of designer babies because this is a very specific use case and it's been ethically vetted. When something like this comes through and it's a breakthrough and then you're a doctor, say it were to be approved in the U.S., would you have to be trained on this? How would doctors here in the U.S. even learn about this technology?  Well, it would start in the embryology lab. A lot of people don't realize that IVF doctors aren't the ones actually performing these microsurgical procedures on eggs and sperm and creating embryos. So we rely on a team of embryologists. And these are highly skilled, trained individuals that would learn from the experts overseas that are already pioneering this technique. And we would be able to bring it here as long as we had the regulatory oversight and approval.  Fascinating. Dr. Lucky, we want to thank you so much for being here and explaining that. You did a good job. I was able to follow along, so thank you for that. OK, now to our series, the cost of denial and the technique more people are using to fight back against the insurance companies that deny coverage or claims. Our Brian Chung looked into artificial intelligence producing very real results. I basically avoided stairs. Yeah. If I could. That's because every step was grueling for Stephanie Nixdorf.  In Davidson, North Carolina, her morning routine nearly impossible to get through without pain. She had to ask for help just to open a juice container. So even that was something you couldn't do six months ago. Oh yeah, no, no, no.  In 2022, Stephanie was diagnosed with stage four skin cancer. Luckily, she responded well to immunotherapy. But the flip side of that is that there are side effects. For Stephanie, that meant excruciating joint pain. Two doctors recommended the infusion medication infliximab, but her insurance denied coverage.  I remember getting on the phone and yelling at the insurance company. You yelled at the insurance? Yeah, yeah. Stephanie's husband, Jason, furious when he saw the denial letter from Primera Blue Cross, which had covered her cancer care, saying the services requested don't meet guidelines for coverage and called the use of infliximab experimental. Two appeals were also denied. Did you feel like you were being treated as human beings? Absolutely not. Just a no."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 33, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2180.037, "text": "Yeah, no name, no face kind of thing. Gmail."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 34, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2183.622, "text": " Desperate, Jason turned to artificial intelligence. You get to the point of where, OK, this is our last hope. He had come across a doctor developing an AI tool to take on insurance companies. That doctor helped him use AI to generate an appeal letter for Stephanie more than 20 pages long. Within 48 hours of sending in that version, along with copies to public officials. Right up top, your appeal was approved.  Despite the three previous denials for Stephanie, Primera Blue Cross now tells NBC News that the denial of service came from a Primera processing error involving a misapplication of policy. There was no intent to deny care. The ultimate approval letter from Primera said, I want to apologize that you have been waiting to receive treatment for nine months. Now there are AI services specifically designed for insurance denials. Introducing Claimable.  One of them, claimable, says it can generate appeal letters for coverage of 70 medications for a cost of about $40. Climbing stairs and stuff like that. Climbing stairs.  We tested it with Jason, plugging in insurance information and using dropdown menus to explain symptoms and the deny claim. So I will hit continue. In about 15 minutes, I had an expansive appeals letter, complete with scientific references and personal stories. These are things I would never have thought of. The Nixdorps credit AI with Stephanie finally getting the drugs she needed, but they're left frustrated it took so much time. If you could talk to the CEO of the insurance company,  What would you say? I would say, what if this was your wife? Yeah. And this was happening to you? Yeah. Or your daughter, or your sister. That message from a couple that says they had to use artificial intelligence to be treated like real people.  OK. Brian Chung joins us. So Brian talk to me about this AI because some people at home may be thinking I've just used chat GPT. I can. I've never written a letter with artificial intelligence. Is it easy to use. Yeah. And shout out to Gretchen Morgensen who helped out with that reporting. But Tom if you're trying to put together a letter to dispute a denied claim from an insurance company.  most people wouldn't know where to begin. So I think that the utility of this artificial intelligence tool, which kind of operates almost like a tax filing software, you just answer a bunch of questions about your condition, about why you need that certain drug, but then it'll do the research of figuring out what medical studies reinforce that you need that drug. And also describes, I can't play tennis and use human language to make that a very sympathetic letter and make it the length that would work and be successful with an insurance company.  That's kind of the formula. And again I mean I tried. I demoed it. You saw it."}, {"keywords": ["Apple"], "line": 35, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 2335.491, "text": "Yeah."}, {"keywords": ["Apple"], "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2336.172, "text": "It's so simple. But you're Brian Chong. You know you're a smart young guy. You know keyboards. You know good with the clothes. Good with the reporting. So I mean Brian. But I have to ask you if if if people can use a I to write these claim letters.  Can the insurance companies use AI to read the letters. We'll see. And this is the question. And there have been concerns that insurance companies are using AI to basically deny these claims in the first place. So that is very much part of the conversation here. Might these insurance companies just use AI to defend themselves from other people using AI to submit their  appeals. So again this is kind of a battle but I want to point out that there have been a number of states that have been trying to clamp down on insurance companies and trying to make it illegal for them to screen these request letters from clients that are trying to submit other letters. With the A.I. when you were looking at it was it just perfectly written like just the arguments were so precise. It really feels like filing your taxes. I know that that sounds really boring and really arcane but you know what you mean.  Yeah, there are all these questions, and it just breaks it down into a simple questionnaire. And then when you hit Enter, within 15 minutes, it generates a letter. Any more shout outs, or are you good? I think that's it for me. OK, Brian, thank you. Appreciate it. Some breaking news here in the entertainment world. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ending next year with CBS retiring the late night franchise. Colbert taking to social media to announce it. Here it is. I want to let you know something that I found out just last night. Next year will be our last season. The network will be ending The Late Show in May.  CBS said the decision was purely financial, quote, against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content, or other matters happening at Paramount. It's worth noting Colbert has been critical of CBS's parent company, Paramount's decision to settle a lawsuit with President Trump. The show topped the ratings for the 1130 slot. Stephen Colbert has hosted the late show for nine years now.  We're back now with Top Story's Global Watch. At least 60 people are dead and 11 are missing after a fire tore through a shopping center in eastern Iraq. Video showing the building in flames and its charred remains. Civil defense teams rescued 45 people who were trapped when the fire broke out. The cause of this incident was not immediately known.  Spanish search and rescue teams are frantically searching the Pyrenees Mountains for an American hiker missing for more than a week. The missing hiker, believed to be 27-year-old Cole Henderson, set out for a solo hike on July 9th, telling a friend he was putting his phone on airplane mode. That, according to family members and social media posts. The Spanish Civil Guard, who did not confirm the hiker's name, said their search started Monday with teams finding a parked car at a trail entrance.  Rescue teams are working to free students from a 70-seat bus after a major crash in Somerset in the United Kingdom. Police say the bus was returning to a local school after a day trip, carrying a number of adults and children when it overturned. There are multiple casualties, including one child has been killed.

And this year, he even got his first ever presidential commemorative inaugural Diet Coke bottle from the CEO of the company himself. So perhaps it comes as no surprise that yesterday, President Trump posted on Truth Social that because of him, Coca-Cola will be switching to real cane sugar in Coke in the United States. Coca-Cola has been using corn syrup for its products in the U.S. since the early 1980s.  Coke has responded with neither confirming or denying in their statement, just saying that while they appreciate Trump's enthusiasm, it would have, quote, more details on new innovative offerings coming soon. Let's bring in editor-in-chief at Investopedia, Caleb Silver, to talk more about this. Look, Caleb, I'm from Atlanta. Like, Coca-Cola to me is...  it was Atlanta's gift to the world. You know, I get it. And like at home, even all the time, we are always like, we want Mexican Coke in the glass bottles because it has real cane sugar. And most people I know are like, yeah, I like that version better. So I think a lot of people probably saw what President Trump said and thought, okay, fair.

So he would like America's  companies like Coca-Cola to stop using high fructose corn syrup. And in this case, the president weighing in on what is basically a business decision for Coca-Cola. People may prefer the taste of cane sugar, but it is more expensive to make Coca-Cola with cane sugar. They've been using high fructose corn syrup since 1985, as you mentioned. Why? Because there were subsidies for corn farmers that made that product a lot cheaper. And they've been doing this now for, you know, 40 years.

All of that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially billions of dollars for Coca-Cola. And why make a change? They have the number one soft drink in the world still. Diet Coke actually sometimes outsells Coca-Cola. So it's not just a simple change of changing the ingredient, change the entire supply chain, get new suppliers.

I mean, the liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be.  We're looking at our scanners. We have put in place in TSA a multi-layered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening. So it still is safe.

Restrictions ratcheted up in the years following 9-11. You probably remember, right? Which includes liquids, how much you can bring, along with taking off your shoes and security. Both of those went into effect in 2006. Then between 29, 2010, full body scans and pat-downs.  Those came along. A small but then welcome rollback in 2013. Pay for TSA pre to avoid some, but let's face it, really not all of the hassle. But earlier this month, Nome announced that the shoes off rule was no more. Getting rid of that. And it's very clear from the last 36 hours or so that we are likely to see big changes at the airports. She's at an airport right now in Tennessee with a new announcement.  And you heard the comments that she told me just yesterday. So what might all of this look like? John Pistol ran the TSA for four and a half years as the head of the TSA. He also oversaw the creation of TSA Pre, implemented full body scans and pat-downs at USA airports, and joins me live tonight. John, thanks for being with us. You're the guy I wanted to talk to, so I appreciate the time, because you know this.  In and out. I'll be honest, I don't know the 3-1-1 rule. I had to look it up, and I think I'm probably like most people, right? And it turns out with liquids, it's the three ounces, the one bag, it's gotta be clear one bag per person. Kristi Noem's basically suggesting that could go. Is she right here?  Yeah, so I think the context is always important here, Blake, in terms of why was the rule put in place? And it goes back to September of 06, when a group of 18 or 20 British nationals had a plot to blow up 8 or 10 airliners coming from the UK to the US and Canada.  with liquid explosives. And fortunately, the Metropolitan Police and the British Security Service, MI5, were able to disrupt that plot. But immediately after that, the new liquids  aerosols and gels, so they're called LAGs, L-A-G, liquid aerosol gels, that rule went into effect. And so the key is, what the Secretary's talking about, I think is terrific in terms of innovation and moving forward with what we call... So you agree with her on the liquids front? Time to take a look at it and say, you know what, maybe some changes here?  Yeah, I think it's a great time to look at it because a couple of factors. One, technology has improved. The technology has actually been there for quite a while, but just has been a cumbersome, slow process to take somebody's liquids out if they had more for whatever may be. And so that's been the challenge. And the 100 milliliters, 3.4 ounces, was based on what the FBI intelligence community did in terms of working with DHS and TSA to say,  What could be catastrophic to a flight if it exploded, if it was liquid explosives? And so that's why that 3-1-1 rule came into place. So you talked about the technology. The other thing the Secretary said to me was that we could get to a spot soon where you just take the bag, you roll right on through, and it takes one minute.  Is that coming? Is that where we are? Well, I'm intrigued by that to know if you refer to what we used to call the checkpoint of the future, which goes back to the analogy of the old Arnold Schwarzenegger film where he's walking through and you basically see a skeleton with a gun walking through. It's not that, but given the improvements in technology,  and the biometric identification of passengers, positively identifying the passenger with who they are in front of the TSA officer. Yeah, I think the remote screening and things, there's a number of opportunities that the Secretary and I would add the Acting Administrator McNeil on looking at how can TSA best work with the traveling public. I also applaud the work of the U.S. Travel Association for what they have done  on their commission for seamless and secure travel, because they've advocated for this for quite a while. You think we're months from that? Yeah, that's a good question. Of course, a political announcement could be made at any time. There's no politics in this town, John. Well, no, I would never suggest that, of course. But if the TSOs, they're called Transition Security Officers, the frontline workforce that most passengers encounter, if they are trained,  and the technology is employed in a systematic and consistent way. So the old adage when I got to the ESA was, if you've seen one airport, you've seen one airport. So each is unique. So how can it be rolled out in a consistent, predictable way, but doesn't provide a roadmap to terrorists who might want to try to exploit this easing of the rules, frankly?  Couple more for you here, because again, this is a story, John, that went everywhere last night and into today, and for good reason, because think about the tens of millions of Americans that fly every year, you add it all up, I think it's something like 750 million people every year that TSA, yeah, it's way up there, yeah. TSA Pre, I asked the Secretary this yesterday, Precheck, yeah, I call it TSA Pre, TSA Precheck.  you're the one that that oversaw that when that when in it was uh... you're the tsa administrator do we still need that like i hear you when i hear the secretary sort of outlining this world that we're about to live in at the airport and now wonder and do we need to use a preacher  Yeah, it's a good question. And it sounds like the secretary is looking at that. And I applaud her for that. As she mentioned, and I agree with her, that TSA PreCheck does still provide an added value to passengers who don't have to do other things like take a jacket off or keep electronics. They can keep electronics in their bags and things like that. So there is added value. And there's additional screening that takes place  with the TSA pre-check passengers, and so they are assessed as a lower risk, even though they may be a random selection for some additional screening. If you're not in the TSA pre-check population, though, there's a higher likelihood, still low, that you might be selected for random screening, which is more time-consuming and more intrusive.  let let me let me leave you with this because as i mentioned you you ran the tsa for for four-and-a-half years you also were the deputy director over at the fbi uh... safe to say you know uh... a thing or two about security in in several different forms i could ask the question and i am asked the question  Are we, you know, it's 25 years since 9-11, which was a lot of this was put in directly as a result of 9-11. And I gotta imagine, John, that there's some folks out there saying, are we not as focused on the threat as we should be? Or is it just that the tech is there, it's 2025, and this is the world we live in?  Yeah, it is, and that's why we refer to it as risk-based security, because anytime you do something that either enhances security or diminishes, depending on how you look at it, there is a risk involved. And so it's this new rule, if it goes to effect, just like leaving shoes on, that's great until the next shoe bomber, like Richard Reed from December of 2001, came along and tried to exploit a loophole. So it's great until somebody tries  just like the UK bombers where they injected hydrogen peroxide into the bottom of soda bottles or the plastic. So the fields will be intact. So they look like they're completely legit. And yet, when mixed with other chemicals that they also screened in other bottles, it would be a bomb that would bring down an airliner. So it's, that's why it's called risk based. There's no perfect solution. Yeah.  i will leave it there here in the tsa uh... for quite some time john pistol with us tonight reacting to the news and then he just secretary christina nice to see you sir thanks for being with us you can't thank you course without julie manchester national political reporter for the hill you're fascinating interview yesterday there were all sorts of policy discussions nice to see you get to see you too uh...

It's remarkable. A couple different jobs. Tell me, so this, we didn't, there had been some pictures out there and folks wondering what was what. Caroline goes to the podium today, outlines it. I'm not a doctor and don't play one on TV, tell me.  So, as a urologist, I take care of a lot of older patients. It generally tends to be that type of patient population. This is not an uncommon thing. As people get older, the veins have little valves in them, and that's what allows blood to stay in a place, and then muscles contract and actually pushes blood from the legs back up into the heart.  As time goes by, these valves become a little bit more incompetent. They're not working quite as well. So that leads to some stasis, some blood not coming back up as well. You also looked, and apparently the president had this also, had an echocardiogram to look and make sure he didn't have what they call right heart failure, where the right heart is not taking in the blood like it should. That didn't seem to be a problem. So this is a common thing. And apparently he takes aspirin, so that's the bruising on the hand. Very common stuff.  stuff like this when they went to treat him and all that. Obviously, he normally goes once a year to Walter Reed. That doesn't appear to be the case. They could do this at the White House or a Lago Bedminster, wherever. This is not anything that really needs treatment other than probably wearing some Venus stockings. Especially if he's traveling on Air Force One a lot, taking long plane flights, I would recommend that for any older individual that has  long flights ahead of them, keep themselves well hydrated. The chronic venous insufficiency also can raise your risk slightly of getting deep vein thrombosis, which is the real life-threatening issues. I thought it was kind of remarkable that, given the backdrop, and I'm gonna get to the other side of the aisle here in a second, but given the backdrop, and he's 79 years old, that the White House came out today and said, look, this is what happened, we're putting out a letter on something that you say is fairly not  It's not uncommon. Uncommon. So I guess what I'm getting at is, is this sort of the new normal, given what happened and all the questions in the last administration? Do you think this is where we're at going forward, that if something happens, not even specific to Donald Trump, but presidents going forward, that White Houses are going to say, OK, OK, OK?  Well, given the lack of transparency. Or was it just that the images were out there and they needed to address it? Probably a little bit of both. But given the lack of transparency we saw from the last administration, everybody knew that the president was having mental faculty issues. I mean, if you didn't know it, come on, you're living under a rock. But the fact that this is all out on television and the Trump administration has probably been the most transparent of any administration in history,  uh... they're just having it as a conservative republicans on the left story and i think that that's a different issue only that they have but but just as far as the president's health making sure that what he's robust this is not going to for him or deter him from his job uh... in sam's andrew bates who were uh... on cd are giving statements a lot and or in the by the administration green john pierre press secretary of very familiar  face Jeff Zients, the White House Chief of Staff. They are going to be, as we understand it, giving a deposition soon in the House Oversight Committee case as it relates to President Biden. Do you think this gets anywhere? Because we really haven't learned anything, to be frank, up until this point in time. In fact, two individuals, including the President's former doctor, have pled the fifth.  yeah i know i i don't know that will ever get to a smoking gun as it were uh... you know this was i think it goes down truly hiding his problems with mental uh... mental issues that will go down as the greatest line grace cover-up in in in political history for the united states as far as the white house and you know to that point also oblique the the wife of the president she knew this was going on how could she really stomach and and and push this out uh... part of hard to really fathom how she could hide that  do you kevin o'connor uh... basically invokes client privilege blame  uh... as a no i don't think you know if they're specific issues on the system because discuss issues unless i have people clearance but there's also a fine line there in what was trying to be asked of him uh... to be straight for i think his attorney said don't say don't answer anything i would have loved to have gotten and discuss with him aside from other issues about prostate cancer about screening about trying to actually do something good for the country let's learn from this uh... but i i don't it didn't surprise me to printable pleaded for  headed down to take care of patients uh... it's only here and well if we get out here and i think if you get out here and i think it was a great murphy republican thank you doctor thank appreciate i still much more ahead here on the hill tonight remember when the president said this about alcatraz represent something very strong very powerful in terms of law and order our country needs law and order  Can the White House now sell the idea of opening The Rock?

And almost a decade later, Congress established it as a national park, which is why Burgum, the Interior Secretary, was there. Now, half a century later, the island still has to shuttle in fresh water.  while garbage and sewage need to be shuttled out. It's powered by solar panels and diesel generators. In its prime, a max of 336 prisoners. Today, 1.6 million visitors go to Alcatraz each year. Generates about 60 million bucks annually in revenue, making it one of the most popular national parks in this country. And while there is not an official estimate on what it would take to get the facility back up and running again, some projections say it could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

That our time in our airports and security checkpoints can be filled with hospitality and serving people and to get them through in a timely manner and much more efficient as well.  Just last week we made a big announcement that I think a lot of folks were really excited about was that we put on pause the taking off of your shoes at our security checkpoints. Ending the shoes off policy will decrease our passenger wait times through our security checkpoints and it'll make sure that it is a more pleasant and efficient process for everybody.  Finally, as someone who is a mother and a grandmother, I recognize that traveling with little kiddos at times can be difficult or at least cumbersome and time-consuming. So one of the policies that we are changing and implementing as well is that we want to announce that for all families, we'll be implementing a program that is called Families on the Fly.  This means that when families come into our airports and enter our TSA security checkpoints, they will have dedicated lanes specific for families. There'll be expanded areas that will give them the benefit of recognizing that they have children with them and will help make sure that we have the ability to take care of them and their families as they go through this expedited process with their kiddos.  And we also recognize that these family lanes are ones that will be specifically implemented first around large areas where people travel with their kids quite often. We started, I believe, with a pilot project at the Orlando airport because of Disney World being so close.  We're excited to continue to offer these benefits through TSA to help individuals make sure that they are having the security when they travel through our airlines and through our airways, but that also we're making it much more of a pleasant experience for them as well.  This will include, we're also going to make sure that we're giving families a $15 discount when they enroll in TSA PreCheck as well. We're going to be reducing also some of the invasive pat-downs that individuals have seen with children. And so we'll be focusing on making sure that that  activity is as limited as it possibly can be, recognizing that when people are traveling with their children many times, that has been invasive in their privacy. TSA has been working with many national family organizations and with other families and groups to help organize these implementation of policy changes.  And we're going to continue to do that to make sure we're looking at our screening processes, keeping our standards high, but making and accommodating the processes that these families are asking for. As we prepare for one of the busiest summers and falls that we've seen in our country's history, we're also recognizing that we've got even more travelers that are hitting the airways in the future.  with not just the World Cup coming next year, which will bring us 22 million international visitors that will come into this country. We also have the Olympics coming up. We'll be celebrating America's 250th birthday as well next year. So streamlining these processes is incredibly important for us to make sure that we can accommodate the increased traffic that we've seen and continue to do even better into the future.  One of the things that I would note for all of you is that we have seen our seven busiest travel days in history just since the beginning of this calendar year. So more and more people are traveling by air and we're determined to make sure that we're keeping our technology investments, our training for our TSOs and our TSA employees to the highest level so that people can streamline their processes going forward.  We're making sure that every policy that we have is a common sense policy that serves people and keeps us safe. With that, I just want to say thank you for being here and also God bless all of our military members and the folks who live in this country and may they all be safe as they go out and they do their work and continue to defend our country.

They're relooking at a possibility of maybe a walk-on through the security line in a minute, what she was there to announce.  was known as an honor lane involving military families. You heard her there talk about reduced pat-down on children. The bottom line here is, and as we started the show talking to John Pistol, the former head of the TSA, it's been 20 years since some of these policies have been put in place, and it has been very clear over the last 36 hours that the experience at the airport is about to change, and the Department of Homeland Security is rolling it out.  The Hill, back on the other side of the break when we return.  see the difference there. And along with the tight security, we've seen a massive drop in fentanyl seizures at the border. According to government figures, there were 2,100 pounds of fentanyl seized at the border in October. 2024, in the last administration, you'll see how this all sort of plays out.

Welcome to Mad Money. Welcome to Kramer. I do make friends. I'm just trying to make you a little extra money. My job is not just to entertain, but to educate, to teach you. So call me at 1-800-743-CBC. Tweet me at Jim Kramer. You always wish you had a stock that went up 10 bucks in a day. And today we had a bunch of them.  It's a sign that there is a gigantic change afoot, possibly the beginning of something that can make you a lot of money. In a buoyant market where we get strong retail sales numbers, allowing the Dow to gain 230 points, S&P advanced 0.54%, NASDAQ climbed 0.74%, it might be worth going over the anatomy of a 10 point gain in a large cap stock because I now think that there are many of these to be had and I want you to have one. We just need to figure out what we're looking for.  First the good news, these gains are anything but isolated. We're getting a bunch of them each day. Today we saw PepsiCo sort about 10 bucks. PepsiCo? Why? Better than expected numbers, of course. A turn in the fortunes of unhealthy foods. Better executions.  and a variety of different products. PepsiCo isn't some tiny micro cap stock. It's not like some meme cyber player or uranium bottle rocket. And it is not part of the Palantir empire. They probably have something in your fridge or your pantry. Take that Palantir. We saw Eaton  and Parker Hannifin, if you're from the Midwest, these are destination places, sure. But those are a function of strong data center orders that came from lead contractors, ABB and Legrand, to European construction companies that just reported that are huge builders of these warehouses full of servers. There's no doubt that the data center buildout is the single biggest construction boom per person.  Perhaps it's World War Two. You can see it if you look at Oracle every day, by the way. I like the build out. There are many, many orders coming to them. I keep telling you these stocks are good. Parker Hanifin rose $13. Eaton jumped more than $17 or nearly 5% as investing club holders know. That Eaton move turned my earning season around.  because it's a core position in my travel trust. Although a few minutes after I learned about the ecstasy of Eaton's victory, I had the agony of Abbott's defeat. So that's something we'll discuss momentarily, because I'm a masochist and I don't want to pretend that everything I do is right, because it isn't. Now, sometimes in this game, you do just get lucky. You'll come across a surprise quarter that tells you everything you need to know about what can cause a big cap stock to rally 10 points in a session. You'll see how a star is born.  and even get a blueprint for what you need, what you should be looking for. Yesterday, we got a beautiful schematic from none other than Johnson & Johnson. Boy, talk about somebody's name brand in your house, which handed you a 10-point victory for the ages. Here's the stock of a story company, one of just two AAA balance sheet companies with a solid dividend yield and great prospects.  Everyone knows this company, everyone. I mean, lately, its stock has lagged, though, because of litigation. The lawsuit's alleging that their talc-based products contain asbestos. J&J Baby Powder used to use talc, though it's been phased out. The Playlist Bar, using what J&J calls junk science, I like that in the conference call, has recruited more than 80,000 people who claim that talc contained asbestos and gave them cancer. It's kept the lid on the stock. I think that lid is about to, I think that J&J's gonna win this, but it's gonna take a little while.  In the meantime, the lid just blew off the stock yesterday, and it rallied more than 10 points. Least expected rally that I've seen in ages. But you know what?  This company put on a clinic to show you exactly how you can orchestrate such a big gain. So why don't we, why don't we just take part in the clinic? Well, like, well, yeah, we'll attend it remotely. What does it take? Surprises, many surprises, that's what. And I'm going to go over them because it's terrific to have an earning scorecard slash schematic of what a winner looks like. If another company can do something similar, then I think 10 points of upside are just the beginning, including what's going to happen for J&J. Yes, I think that J&J's big move is just starting.  So what did J&J have going for it? First, point blank, you got the holy creduble. That's J&J beating sales and earnings estimates for the quarter and then raising their sales and earnings guidance for the future. You gotta have all four for a stock to go up. And they have to be dramatic. J&J raises full year reported sales guidance by $2 billion. The midpoint is earnings per share guidance by 25 cents. That's just a monster set of numbers for a company whose stock has been languishing.  Second, in the case of the pharmaceutical industry, you need to show some breakthroughs. J&J revealed some results of a five-year trial that showed how their multiple myeloma immunotherapy is bringing a real life-saving hope to patients suffering from this horrendous form of cancer. Third, the company has to have good news on the tariff front. In this case, J&J had previously put out some very high estimates for the cost of tariffs, and they took them down dramatically.  You know what, that made me feel terrific because there are too many companies that are going to have to raise their tariff estimates, which will crush their stocks. For J&J, they cut their tariff forecast from $400 million down to $200 million. I'm calling that better than a sharp stick in the eye. Fourth, we know that there's some sense in the White House that other countries have been abusing us by manipulating their currencies lower, making their exports artificially cheaper versus stuff that we make. Now the shoe's on the other foot with the dollar coming down. The company estimates that it will have an incremental positive  FX impact positive of $1.1 billion versus his previous guidance. That's outstanding. If you own Molden National Stocks, you may be in for a huge positive surprise. It's like, you know, that, you know, it's like one of those things where, like, if you collect foul money that's been missing, that's what this is, collecting foul money that's been missing. Certainly worth looking for.  Fifth, you have to be able to offset what's going away. In every business, there are products that become less important or are copycatted or leapfrogged. They become obsolete. The drug business is a formal exclusivity process governed by the Patent Office. When there's a loss of exclusivity, L-O-E, it creates a big hole. J&J's Telerra, a big-time autoimmune drug, just lost exclusivity. At one point, it generated more than $10 billion a year for this company. Yeah, and now it's just gone, no patent protection, eviscerated, blowing a huge hole in earnings.  But you know what, J&J is such an outstanding company, it gave you a 15.5% operational growth for its farm business, including 13 brands with double-digit growth. In other words, amazingly, Stellera won't be missed. I never thought that could happen. I thought that this would be the stench of Stellera. Six, if there was something wrong last quarter, it better be fixed. Well, J&J's medtech division is truly disappointed last quarter.  It was a major reason why the stock's doing poorly. Voila! Medtech was a bonafide all-star, something that very few thought possible. Seventh, you need big margin expansion, always. This quarter didn't have good gross margin, something that was expected. But J&J did say it was expected to see 300 basis points of operating margin expansion.  Future Margin Improvement. Margin Improvement. Oh, we love that. Eighth, I love jaw-dropping projections. There were an incredible number of these in the conference call, including the stunning claim that by 2030, J&J will be the number one in oncology, with sales of more than $50 billion. Talk about something that makes you want to take a long-term position. They also announced a bladder cancer breakthrough, which could be worth $5 billion in peak sales and would mean so much for the patients. Holy cow. Very tough cancer. J&J has something for it.  Ninth, major health care companies buy other companies for growth. That's just what they do. I've been concerned that the companies J&J bought for its cardio franchise were overpayments, indicating that management doesn't know how to make acquisitions. This is something I'm very concerned about, about Bristol-Myers, by the way, just so you know. It turned out I was wrong in my judgment about J&J. The heart products we saw were remarkable. Let's hope that's the same for Bristol-Myers and their neuro business. Finally, we want to know that the company has figured out that we want growth, high growth, and then more growth.  We don't want so-called safety. Safety is like Listerine, Neutrogena, Band-Aids and Tylenol. Products can be knocked off by anyone with Amazon just eviscerating them on price. J&J had the foresight to spin off the underperforming Kenview mixed consumer products, including those before they imploded, which we saw earlier this week. Some people second guess J&J. Not after this week.  You do these 10 things right, or even just half of them, and I'm telling you, your stock's going to explode higher. If you didn't do it, if you failed to beat and raise, or if you cut, for heaven's sake, like Abbott Labs did, a company we're going to have on tonight, well, I say look out below.  The bottom line, check your stocks. Do they have a chance to change their stripes like JNJ? Do they fit the formula? Remember, JNJ's just beginning, it's smooth. Then you know what? You may be just sitting on, say it with me, a goldmine. Joe at Massachusetts, Joe. Hi, Jim. My three-year-old son and I watch your show every night. He loves the buttons. I think the kid's got horse sense.  So what's happening?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 559.577, "text": "My stock is down 11% from the all time highs.

That is no slight to Jensen Wang because he's number one.  Never do that. All right, with earnings season in full swing, it's time to check your stocks to see if they can fit the formula I just gave you. Right that's where that check was actually pretty good, took me all day. Now on Mad Money Tonight, Abbott Labs just got slammed today after reporting earnings. Buying opportunity, cause for concern, hard egg, cheap scotch is all I'm for? I'll find out.

I was discouraged to get a mixed update from Abbott Labs, a medical technology company that we've long owned for the charitable trust, and I'd say two decades. When Abbott Labs reported this morning, the headlines results were perfectly solid. Management tightened their full year earnings guidance rather than raising it, while also ticking down their organic sales growth forecast and their operating margin outlook.  A lot of investors, including me, have been hoping they'd raise these numbers so the stock got clobbered down more than $11 or 8.5%. I thought it might be down $15. That's what I predicted. It didn't get that low. As I've chronicled many times, this is a stock where we've really had the battle over the past several quarters. We've kept our faith in the Chabot Trust during some nasty litigation last year. The stock bounced back from that. But after today's guidance, I'm beginning to wonder if the juice is worth the squeeze.  So let's go directly to the source with Robert Ford. He's the chairman and CEO of Abbott Labs. To let him make the case for the stock. Comes on in good and bad times. I like that. Mr. Ford, welcome back to Mad Money.  Well, thank you for having me, Jim. OK, so Robert, we know that there were many good things that happened, but let's just touch on what went wrong. Diagnostics, because while it was not the biggest division, it certainly had an incredible impact today.

We delivered high single digit sales growth we delivered EPS growth of 11% ahead of the street. Gross margin expansion of a hundred basis points like we had committed in a lot of pipeline activity. We even got our tariff to manageable numbers so like to your point we're really in a position to be able to kind of raise our guidance what ended up happening is what we saw in the quarter. Was that the recovery that we had planned for our diagnostic  business, specifically in China, we did not see the recovery the same way that we had projected for other places. So the United States grew 7%, Europe grew 8%, Latin America grew 16%. So we saw the recovery in our diagnostic business everywhere except China. So what we did today in our guidance was we said we're going to delay that recovery in China from Q2  to Q4, and that brought down the guidance of the revenue growth, specifically of that business. So what are you left with after this guy, Jim? You've got a $44.5 billion revenue business  growing 7.5% to 8%, double-digit EPS, a lot of margin expansion, a very rich pipeline. Ultimately, really, the fundamentals of our business are intact. I maintained our guidance for 2026 in terms of high single-digit growth and double-digit EPS. A lot of the reports that are coming out right now, they haven't changed their price targets, and they haven't changed their forecast. I think this is a little bit of an overreaction.

The executives who ducked me on a day like today are executives who I lose faith in.  The ones who come on with daily today are the ones I keep faith in and that is Robert Ford Abbott Laboratories chairman CEO Robert I really appreciate you coming on a tough day Thank you, Jim bad money back Coming up it might be summer but Kramer is turning in some homework on two names you called in about he's revealing which ones make the grade next  On Monday, I got stumped by Nicole in California who called and asked me about a company called NewTex Health. Tiny business. Never heard of it. This is mainly a health care provider. They own and operate 24 mini hospitals and hospital outpatient departments across 11 states with 10 more facilities in various stages of development. NewTex also has a much smaller population health management division, which owns and operates health care provider networks.  like physician groups and their affiliates. Basically though, this is a company that runs a network of standalone emergency room facilities. And management says they can treat over 95% of problems that a normal ER can solve with a fraction of the wait time. We're talking about 15 to 30 minutes instead of multiple hours, filling a crucial gap in our healthcare system. I like that.  The reason that I didn't recognize this one is that NewTek's health, as it stands now, was only created three years ago when the old privately held NewTek's merged with a health management company called Clinigen's Holdings in order to become public. On the day the deal was completed, NewTek's began trading on Nasdaq. Its shares skyrocketed a comical 525 percent.  to a split-adjusted price of $6,000. The bill came right back down in a matter of weeks. Then it kept going lower because 2022 was a bad time for companies to come public through the back door. In fact, as of last summer, NewTexas' market capitalization dropped as low as $22 million, and the company was almost delisted. It only managed to stay on the Nasdaq by executing not one, but two reverse splits. Two. Last year, a one-for-15 reverse split in April, and then a one-for-10 reverse split in July.  But after standing off delisting, the stock's had an incredible run. In a little over 12 months, Nutex rallied from $4 in change to just under $111 as of today. Another staggering move from this thing. Although in the past two months, the stock has come down more than 70 points from its highs. Right now, this thing has a market capitalization of $615 million, which is one big reason why it is so darn volatile.  So what explains that stunning rally from last year's lows? OK, in the second half of last year, NewTek's found a new way to grow its revenue by hiring a third party vendor to assist with bill collection. Hospitals have a huge problem with unpaid bills, and these guys are taking advantage of a relatively new arbitration process to collect. So far, it's been very, very effective.  Now, the stock really exploded higher after NewTek's reported fourth quarter results at the end of March. The numbers were insanely strong, with revenue up 270 percent. Year over year, get this, the company earned $11.12. What do you think Wall Street was expecting? How about a 21 cent loss? Again, 90 percent of their revenue growth was about effectively collecting unpaid medical bills.  Armed with this new arbitration tool, NewTex was suddenly making much, much more money than anyone imagined they could. And that's why throughout the month of April and early May, as the rest of the market was in rough shape, the stock was flying, climbing from $47 at the end of March to that high of $184 and change at the end of May. I would say that was mid-May.  Now these May highs came after NewTek's last reported on May 13th, when they once again delivered almost comically higher than expected numbers, nearly $212 million in revenue. The analysts were only looking for $134 million, $2.56 per share. What were the analysts looking for? How about $1.77? Same story here again.  Management said the new arbitration process accounted for 73% of the year-over-year revenue increase. Now, there are some other factors in play. The company opened four new micro hospitals last year, and that helps add growth for sure, but it's peanuts compared to better bill collection. So why has this not come in over the past couple of months? Well, after a modest pullback in late May, NewTek started pulling back hard in the first week of June, ultimately falling more than 27% that week.  Towards the end of that week, an analyst at Benchmark wrote a note explaining that the pullback was because of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia filing a lawsuit against two physician provider groups that are using that same arbitration process that NewTex has had so much success with. Now, look, the lawsuit doesn't involve NewTex, OK? But it's possible the arbitration gravy train might be facing some additional scrutiny.  And that's why I'm reluctant to stick my neck out for this one.  I have zero read on the loss of Georgia, but the fact that NewTek's success in this arbitration process has come so easily out of nowhere makes me worry that perhaps it could go just as easily away out of nowhere. Plus, they've already had two great quarters fueled by the process. In two more quarters, they'll be lapping the changes, and those tremendous growth numbers will indeed evaporate. At best, it's a major one-time change that instantly made NewTek's a lot more profitable. But given that the stocks already have, you know, just up gigantically, you might need a new catalyst if you want more upside.  On top of that, hey, I put some yellow flags here. In late March, NewTek's delayed the release of its fourth quarter results by a couple of days. That's kind of weird. Then in late May, NewTek's disclosed that it hired a new auditor. Not weird, just bad. Neither of these things is a deal breaker by itself, but let's say they raise eyebrows. OK, that's what you say when you're afraid to say anything more.  Second, earlier this week, NewTek's announced in an 8K file that its COO is leaving. Again, nothing terrible here. He's leaving to become the CEO of another company. God love you. But it's not something you want to see. Third and finally, the whole healthcare provider universe is about to get slammed thanks to the president's big, beautiful budget bill, because in a couple of years, there'll be major Medicaid cuts, and that means less business for hospital operators.  In the end, NewTek has an interesting story, but it sure feels like I missed it. How about that? Now, because we missed it, it's risky. Hey, next up, last night, boy, are we ever up to date. Greg in Michigan asked me about a company called Flex LNG, which has special ships that transport natural gas overseas. And I punted, why? Because I was worried that it had a 3.4% dividend yield, and that seems big. When you see such a high yield, it warrants further investigation. Because often, A, yeah, I've got everything tonight.  a red flag. That's a sign that the investors don't trust the dividend. But if you're looking at the story, you know what? Get this. I'm actually feeling pretty good about Flex LNG. Looking at the numbers, the dividend feels safe to me, even if the company's balance sheet is far from clean. Still, Flex LNG's dividend has remained constant at 75 cents per quarter since mid 2021. The company hasn't had to cut it. In fact, in 2022 and 2023, they threw in some additional special dividends.  I don't expect that again, but I'm not worried about the normal payout. They consistently generate much more free cash flow than they need to pay the dividend. This year, the projected cash flow is a bit lower than a total dividend, but the company has $400 million in cash as of the latest quarter, and it has no major debt repayments before 2028.

For years, we've all presumed that these GOP-1 weight loss wonder drugs would change the world. The promise of instant weight loss was so compelling that we expected wholesale changes in behavior. The street went nuts with it, drawing wildly absurd conclusions about what would happen, not just in the food and restaurant stocks. For example, when the fear of GOP-1s first swept the industry in September of 2023, the brokerage house Jeffries put out a piece arguing that the huge global market for these drugs by 2030 would mean great news for the airlines.  The research note titled, quote, Way to Go Airlines Implications of a Slimmer Society, end quote, actually posited that GOP-1s could mean the average flyer loses 10 pounds, which translates into a weight loss of 1,790 pounds per flight and means massive fuel savings for the airlines. So you should go buy the airline socks. Now, I said at the time that that was the peak of the research hysteria.  And it did make you wonder about the hype around the GLP-1 drugs. Today we got our first data point that makes me wonder if the GLP-1s themselves may have hit a short-term peak.  I'm talking about the dramatically better-than-expected quarter from PepsiCo. It was a tour de force on all counts, especially international. When you read through the conference call and you speak to CEO Ramon Laguardia, it's hard not to question whether something negative has happened in the world of the GOP-1 drugs, because the Frito-Lay numbers, which have been weak, a weakness presumed to be in part caused by GOP-1 use, have suddenly turned up.  Now, maybe PepsiCo has figured out how to make portion sizes that can still entice people who are taking a Zempic or Monjaro. That's a trick, because these drugs make you feel like you're full on less food. So perhaps a smaller size bag is just a winner. Or maybe PepsiCo has come up with new flavors that can literally beat the GLP-1s, because these drugs reduce your cravings for all sorts of stuff. But who knows if there really is a chemical workaround for Doritos. It's definitely possible. However, what I'm thinking, as someone who owns Eli Lilly for the Chapel Trust,  and who wishes I owned PepsiCo, is that there might be a short-term peak in the use of these drugs. The Achilles heel of these drugs is that they're too effective. At some point you lose enough weight and you might think you can stop taking them. So far it looks like that might be happening with people who've been on these things for a year. Maybe they just don't understand that the weight comes right back on when you stop taking them.  We know there are numbers that show a big drop off in GOP 1-1 use after a little more than a year. Maybe people have had it with giving themselves needles, or maybe there just aren't enough people willing to pay full price until a few months ago, compounding pharmacies could still sell cheaper generic versions because there was a serious shortage. That's now over. In the end, I think it's probably hard to keep taking this stuff once you're thin.  Whatever the case, if Eli Lilly is going to break out from this level, it needs breakthroughs in new areas, heart, brain, that it just doesn't have right now. Or there has to be some new data that shows something else positive that the GOP-1 drugs can do. And of course, it's got to start coming in pill form because people are tired of taking needles. I still like the stock of Eli Lilly.  We have a huge game this month for the Chappell Trust. We're going to hang on to it for now. But PepsiCo's breakout, a lack of Lilly's breakthroughs, and a reminder that at one point we were thinking of buying the airlines because of these GOP-1 drugs, means that I no longer feel as certain about Lilly's future. Without science, it says these drugs do a lot more than just control diabetes and make you lose some weight. I'm Jim Cramer.

And that PAC has had a lot of power in the 2024 election. They donated around $200 million to various candidates. And they just announced that they have a current war chest of $141 million that they plan to spend in the midterms in a bipartisan manner. And, really, what you saw yesterday from these bills is they do have bipartisan momentum.  That's going to be really critical for a market structure bill. That is the one, you know, the stablecoin bill's getting signed into law today, but it's market structure, that broader bill for digital assets that a lot of these crypto companies really want to see. That one's not at the finish line yet. It's got to go through the Senate. We know there are some challenges there, getting the Senate, the House to work together, making sure Democrats are on board for passage.  But there is hope that they can actually start moving forward on that bill, maybe near the end of September. Optimistically, maybe passage in October.

If the economy goes south, let's say, in the second half of the year\u2014and I'm not saying I'm expecting this at all, and I certainly hope it doesn't.  But let's face it, Trump has the perfect scapegoat in Jay Powell. He's going to lambast him. He said he didn't lower the interest rates. That's why we're in trouble. He's not going to blame anything else. And a lot of people can say, yeah, this is his second big mistake after not taking care of inflation. Too slow there, too slow now. He'll fire him.

I've got to pick the chairman when I want, how I want, how long I want. That is a threat. Don't forget, our Federal Reserve is not at all a part of our Constitution. It's a creature of the U.S. Congress.  created by the Federal Reserve Act, 1913. All its powers devolve from Congress. Congress has amended the Federal Reserve Act many times. It could do it again.

Kevin Warsh, I listened closely to his\u2014it was on Squawk Box yesterday morning. I was very impressed with his analysis.  I think he would be an excellent chairman. By the way, both of them have actually far more monetary training than does Jay Powell. So I think we're not handing this to a hack. Yeah, would interest rates go down a little bit faster?  Probably, yes. Is that a disaster? Really, no. I mean, there's many, many economists. I'm one of them. But we heard from Waller. There are several others. And probably the most famous one, the Taylor rule, which John Taylor, who almost became Fed chairman, has been the most followed and talked about rule for setting rates, says the Fed funds rate should be in the 3% range. Now, I know Trump has said 2, 1, and all that. And that's not going to happen.  But there is a case. Right now, I think, it's so politically compromised, he's going to go into the meeting, and anyone who supports lower rates is going to be considered a Trump lackey.  Listen, I want Trump to own this economy. No scapegoat. If he gets to pick someone and the economy goes south, he really doesn't have anyone to blame. Oh, he'll probably try to blame Powell for something in the past. You know, he's still blaming Biden for things in the past. But that won't have the credibility that if Powell does make a mistake here, it would be very bad for the Fed.  And if things go well, let's assume the economy booms. Do you think Powell is going to get any credit? Do you think the Fed is going to get any credit? No. It's going to be the, you know, the big, beautiful bill. It's going to be, you know, Trump's tax cuts, Trump's tariff, Trump's deregulation. No one is going to remember Chairman Powell. No one's going to say he's the one that caused it. So there's no upside.  This is a difficult situation. I mean, I'm not giving good choices here. I'm just saying, perhaps the least bad choice, you still serve at the pleasure\u2014you know, every four years, the president chooses you. He chooses every member of the board. He chooses the chair. He chooses the vice chair. So, how much independence really is there?  You want to maintain the ability not to be able to just say, OK, you're the reason this economy didn't well.
