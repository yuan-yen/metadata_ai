We're always subject to negotiate something that's fair, but we've talked to most of the countries and pretty much they've had their way for many, many decades, as you know.

But we had no other president that was willing to do this. I did it in my first term with China and others. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs. No inflation. The most successful  period of time that we've ever had financially in the country. The first term, I think this term is going to be much better, even much better than that.

We've already taken in over $100 billion worth of tariffs, and we haven't even started. And all I say to the other countries is, you know, some of them wanted to make a deal and wanted to be fair.

Yeah, long term debt for corporations. And so we need to watch whether the curve steepens. I'm not necessarily so concerned about the absolute rate, which frankly, hopefully will not bust beyond 5 percent on the 30 year. But I'm concerned about the steepness, because once the steepness gets to a serious level,  Countries around the world and lenders to the United States will start to take notice that the short-term rates are so low versus the very long-term rates. That indicates trouble on the long-term horizon. So we need to go ahead and start beating that down with good growth in this country.

I want to start with Levi Strauss. Shares higher by 11.3% today. They hit the highest level in more than a year. This after the company came out yesterday and boosted its net revenue forecast for the full year. A big question a lot of investors had was,  what has been and what will be the impact on the company from tariffs. Harmeet Singh, the company's CFO and chief growth officer, he told our Bloomberg News team that'll be about $25 to $30 million through the end of the year. We actually had him on our program a few hours ago.  And I asked him specifically about moving production, moving manufacturing to the United States, because that is exactly what the president wants to see. It doesn't matter if it's in Vietnam or China or Indonesia or where it is. The president wants to see it here in the US. He was decidedly firm in his answer that is not going to happen for Levi Strauss. He mentioned that 98% of apparel that comes to the United States and that is sold in the United States is actually manufactured outside of the US.  They're not going to change that here when it comes to Levi Strauss, though. He's still working through tariffs and even making last minute changes based on the news that he hears from the president, even up to late last night after earnings, he mentioned. Also, performance food group shares surged higher today.  Bloomberg News reported that the company has attracted takeover interest from U.S. Foods Holding Corp. It's a potential deal that would create a food distribution company with a combined sales of roughly $100 billion. This is according to people familiar with the matter. Shares higher by more than 4.8 percent today.  The company would become the number one U.S. food service distributor with 18% of the $371 billion market. This is according to Bloomberg Intelligence. We should note there is no certainty that these deliberations will lead to transactions, and representatives for U.S. Foods and Performance Food declined to comment.  And finally, this is a former micro-cap that is now a small cap after today's move of close to 40 percent, Unusual Machines. It's a drone tech company based in Florida, and drone-related firms rallied today, this after Fox News reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued orders to ramp up production and deployment of drones.  unusual machines hired today by close to 40 percent. Josh Sullivan over at Benchmark says the memo focused on three main goals, bolstering U.S. drone manufacturing, delivering thousands of low-cost drones to the military, and integrating drone operating into training.

So I appreciate that the published statistics are showing things about share of foreign-born and the like.  Those statistics, while I don't mean to impugn them at all, these are large changes that are happening right now and those statistics are probably not fully catching up with what's happening. My guess, my analysis suggests that the surge in immigration over the past few years is actually still pushing up labor supply.  And the reason I say that is because there's a big swath of immigrants that are new to this country that are eligible to apply for work permits. And we have seen a surge in those work permit applications. And while approval rates are down, like, for example, between April and May, this administration approved almost 700,000 work permits for recent immigrants.  And so I think one of the reasons that we've seen such strong employment numbers over the past few months, on average 150,000, I think that that is because labor supply is still being pushed up by the recent surge in immigration, but we can't ride that wave forever, and we're probably just about at the moment that that increase in labor supply comes to an end, and we start seeing payroll employment numbers that are closer to like  30,000 a month, 10,000 a month in a year or so we could start seeing payroll employment numbers that are negative and that will be like a healthy, sustainable, full employment labor market just with declining labor supply and so declining employment. So what does that mean for participation and the unemployment rate?  So there's going to be some near-term gyrations. A year from now, though, to your point, if we're in a negative growth on payrolls, what's the rest of the job market look like? So I think the rest of the \u2013 this is going to be the cognitive dissonance, the thing that's going to be really hard about understanding the labor market that this policy has created.  It could well be that we have a healthy labor market, an unemployment rate that starts with a four. Starts with a four? Starts with a four. It could be a nice, healthy labor market, but we have a shrinking labor supply, and that just means shrinking employment. There are other economies. Are wages through the roof in that world?  For a time, I think that there will be near-term gyrations. We're going to see stronger wage growth in some occupations, stronger wage growth in the agricultural sector, stronger wage growth for home health workers. But I think other parts of the economy,  And particularly some cities, some areas are actually going to see big reductions in consumer demand. We're already seeing this in some areas where we're seeing big raids on immigrant communities. And businesses there are complaining that they're seeing much less demand for their products.  those businesses are going to lower their prices, they're going to lay off workers, and you're going to have deflationary effects."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 26, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1108.873, "text": "I want to focus on the labor supply issue you're referring to, because we know there are people on the sidelines in this.

I don't know that it will happen nearly enough to replace the hundreds of thousands of immigrants that we're talking about no longer being in this country or not coming.  And I'll also say one of the reasons why I'm skeptical that this will be a huge effect is that the labor market has been quite strong for some time. And it has been a pretty good time to get a job. And we've seen stronger labor force participation among some groups, but those groups have actually largely been women.  who have increased their labor force participation rates. There's some excellent work coming out of the Hamilton Project at Brookings showing that labor force participation among women has been particularly strong. Even this strong labor market has not been enough to get these prime age men off the sidelines. So I'm not sure that incrementally stronger wage growth is going to have some cataclysmic effect. But yes, if you make people desperate enough, they will work."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 28, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1232.395, "text": " All right, Wendy, really great to have you.

Everybody's all excited about Superman, right? The Dog Crypto, the latest take on this iconic brand. Yeah, DC Comics, but a different wrinkle now. James Gunn, the Marvel guy, is making it. It's supposed to be a more up-to-date, inspiring, optimistic take on the old tale. Guys like me who grew up with Christopher Reeves are supposed to love this stuff. As you can see on YouTube, the White House  Well, I guess has its own version of Superman. Donald Trump in the full outfit, as you can see, taking off into the heavens. I'm gonna sort of walk you back here a little bit because James Gunn's been doing a lot of press. As I read in what is the best story on the terminal today by the great Jason Bailey, the headline, Superman immigrant backlash is comically misguided. James Gunn said a couple of things.  in some of the media interviews he's been doing. Superman, he said, is the story of America. He told the London Times, quote, an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, unquote. Populated the country. This has created this big woke backlash against the Superman movie because, well, nothing is simple anymore. Big expose on Fox News. It's set social media on fire.  from the far right rage machine in Jason's words. Hence the post on social media today from the White House. We see that again. President Trump as Superman, look at him taking off. He doesn't like dogs though, so I guess there's no crypto. Of course, Donald Trump has a history of this. He's been dressing up as a lot of different things in social media. Remember when he showed up as Rocky just a couple of years ago? Well, that was 2019.  Looks pretty good with the belt, I have to admit. But as Jason Bailey writes, the idea that Superman is a previously apolitical character who has been co-opted by the political left for cultural indoctrination is comically ignorant. You know the guys who started this? Jerry Siegel, Joe Shuster, both children of Jewish immigrants.  And before we even entered World War II, they had a two-page story of Look Magazine called How Superman Would End the War, in which he literally takes Adolf Hitler by the throat. There was later a radio show, Adventures of Superman. A 16-episode arc called Clan of the Fiery Cross, in which Superman took on the KKK.  So Jason makes the point that there's not a lot new here, and I'm really glad that he's with us. Bloomberg Opinion guest columnist, he's a film critic and historian and author of the book, Gandolfini, Jim, Tony, and the Life of a Legend. Jason, I can tell I like you already, and I appreciate your coming to talk to me here on Bloomberg. Are you surprised to see the woke backlash? This is speaking for not really Superman, but the political climate we're in here, right?  Right. I mean, you kind of put your finger on it earlier. You know, nothing is simple anymore. Nothing is what it appears, what its intentions may or may not be. Everything is up for sort of a deep read that's usually comprised of a kind of bad faith. And, you know, I knew  Earlier this year, I actually wrote a different Bloomberg editorial about this, that when Snow White, the Snow White remake tanked, and suddenly people were eagerly ascribing it to, you know, to making it an Israel and Palestine issue, I was like, oh, we really sort of crossed the Rubicon here.  So I'm unsurprised, I'm especially not surprised, you know, these debates run rampant throughout popular culture, but especially in the sort of superhero movie world.  which speaks first, you know, to their cultural ubiquity. Like these really are typically the biggest blockbusters, the movies that everyone sees and thus has an opinion on. Um, but they are also typically loaded, um, for these kinds of readings for a lot of the reasons that we're seeing with the Superman controversy.  So you're a, you're a film critic. You understand the business of Hollywood and you don't see him in your column to feel that this is going to hurt box office receipts for this movie. So are people just talking out of their hats and then going to see the movie? How does that come together?  I mean, I think it's very easy to sort of overestimate the effect that a small number of extremely loud voices can have. And the way that I put it in the column was that, you know, these takes  the likes of which we're seeing on Fox News and Daily Wire and places like that, they generate clicks. They generate the enthusiasm of that audience that goes to those outlets. But those probably aren't the audience for these things anyway. The best sort of example that I've found was recalling the hullabaloo from a lot of the same people over Barbie a couple of years back.  And the sort of the what were in that case much more explicitly stated themes of feminism and diversity and that sort of thing and You know people like Ben Shapiro or say nobody's gonna go see this movie and then it literally breaks box-office records  You know and then someone posted today someone found a clip of him the like the weekend after Barbie came out Saying well, you're gonna see a second weekend drop-off on this like no one's ever seen and like there was no second weekend drop-off It's just you know, it's  It's somewhat performative. I'm sure that in their heart of hearts, these people are genuinely angry that every single work of popular art doesn't speak specifically to them. But a lot of it is generating traffic, generating rage clicks, generating advertiser dollars.  Oh, it's exhausting. Rage click. It's exhausting. Got a life. These are the same people who are going to go see the movie. That's the best part. Jason, uh, really appreciate Jason Bailey is a film critic whose work has appeared as well in the New York times vulture playlist slate and the rolling stone. How did we find you at Bloomberg? This is great. Jason, come back and see us again. Look for him on the terminal and online as we assemble our political panel.

Somebody said that Superman wasn't an illegal immigrant. He was an unaccompanied refugee minor because he was immediately adopted, even though he was born in Kryptonian.

Um, you know, we're seeing a lot of mega backlash and it's not just against this movie from a policy perspective we're seeing it against the poor agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins and the President for considering even amnesty for migrant workers.  And so it's, you know, they take the promises the president made very seriously, and they are pushing back at any attempt, either by him or apparently filmmakers, to tell a different story or pursue a different policy.

Our Bloomberg News team was the first to report that Vietnam's leadership was caught off guard by the president's announcement of a 20% tariff.

Our colleagues there are saying that this deal, or if we're calling it that, this announcement of the president, the U.S. president, has not been amplified by Vietnamese state media particularly heavily.  So it remains a little bit unclear. Now remember this is the only deal with one of the countries that was facing a potential tariff hike this week about the nearly five dozen countries. He also has sort of a framework deal with the U.K. itself had some questions.  And of course, they've got that deal with China to essentially keep talking. So the deals just really aren't materializing. Now, Trump himself has said he's not particularly stressed about that because he simply wants to set unilateral rates anyway. So whether he'll do that or not, we will see. But there have been a lot of developments here on trade this week in the past 48 hours or so.

So they were sort of a test case. Hey, how are you going to deal with this? And what Trump announced was essentially a double tariff for transshipped goods and this 20% rate for all other goods.  you know, there's still some questions swirling about that, including whether, you know, it would include the sort of role in previous tariffs or not. And Secretary Besant was asked about that earlier this week. But it really does look like it's, let's say, more fluid than not. And so that, of course, hangs in the air as we look forward to these China talks. Secretary Besant, Ludnick, USTR Jameson Greer were expecting a new round of China talks, they said, early next month.  But it also looks like Besson and Ludnick are going to Japan where they could perhaps cross paths with the Chinese or even pick up the talks with the Japanese which themselves are having problems right now in those negotiations.

Trump has really not been you know  horse trading. There's not really been an indication of that. And you mentioned in the top about this sort of musing about setting a higher floor. That is one of the biggest questions I had this week. He told the NBC yesterday, hey, we're looking at maybe 15 percent or 20 percent. We don't know whether he meant just for these countries, about five dozen, the ones where the U.S. has a goods trade deficit  Is he talking about those, the ones that have been paused at 10%, are they going to go up 15?

And not to drone on too much, but last night we had the Canada development, that letter to Canada saying he'd raise the rate to 35%. Really important caveat here. Right now it's a three-tiered system for U.S. tariffs on Canada. 25% for a lot of products, 10% for some energy products, and 0% for USMCA-compliant goods. That's Trump's reworked NAFTA from his first term.  We are told that the 35% rate is poised to be applied only to that 25% rate. The 10 would stay where it is, and the USMCA would remain with its carve-out as of now. That's the expectation, but our source is cautioning us that this is a fluid situation, and as we know with Donald Trump, anything's possible.

The flip side is if he just keeps farming out letters,  and doesn't get deals that he likes and starts announcing unilateral deals like with Vietnam that maybe the other countries balk at, then we could just have an August 1st filled with announcements, including potentially if things go sideways with, say, the EU, which has been a very silent issue here.

And instead of that intense, deep concentration in just a handful of names, you're kind of seeing positive performance out of almost all industries in the S&P and more broadly even down cap.  And within those industries, you're starting to see companies with good fundamentals starting to act more favorably. And that's a healthy sign. And it shows that there's, you know, to the point of complacency, I think there's some real work that is being done to really look at company fundamentals and try to position where you want to be for the next, you know, event. So if you look at the market from New Year's Day to now,  It's almost like we're in the same place. So much has happened in between, but we're still flirting with all-time highs here. But that being said, I won't necessarily ask you where are the safe haven areas, but where are the areas for opportunity right now? What are you telling your clients? Yeah, it's a great question, and it's a question we get asked often, right? So I always think about it as risk versus reward.  And I would say from a market cap standpoint, I really like the kind of the smooth cap space. So not all the way down to small cap, but that mid to small area, there's still a lot of names and companies that have continued to perform well.  especially ones with strong balance sheets, experienced management teams, and companies that can kind of control their own destiny, have a lot of flexibility, even given all the changing kind of rules and things happening around them. That's a sweet spot in the kind of size space. In terms of industries,  Like health care, I see a lot of our investment teams taking interest there, but not out of the typical health care services, drug areas. Underneath, if you think about where the next layer of innovation is going to come from, how are you going to  How are we all going to get health care a little bit more efficiently and in a new probably way. That's there's a lot of companies that are exploring and interesting in that area. And then lastly from an asset class standpoint I think emerging markets and international space is really interesting here."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 894.446, "text": "Just 30 seconds help us look ahead to the bank earnings next week.

And I can keep going on. And that really explains the momentum we have. We delivered our third  consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth and growing our profitability. And that is why we believe that we are stepping into the second half. We believe we can manage through the uncertainty of tariffs. The tariff situation is fluid. We assumed an incremental 10 percent on tariffs from the rest of the world and 30 percent from China.  Our view is we are competitively in a better spot to manage through this. Sixty percent of our business is international. We have a fairly diversified supply chain and we've been agile over the years in managing through some of the uncertainties. We've got some mitigation actions, Tim.  We are working with our vendors. A large piece of our growth is driven by higher volumes.

The consumer so far has been resilient.  Our customers, our wholesale retailers, are still buying our products, especially our new product. And because we are a global company, international, for example, has been fairly strong. So, as we manage through the uncertainty, we are trying to do it thoughtfully.  You know, we don't take anything for granted. You know, our view is you've got to continue to earn the trust with our consumers every day. And, you know, especially in moments of crisis, consumers tend to gravitate to brands that are relevant and also, you know, brands they trust. And, you know, because we have been  around for 170 years, navigated different crises. That's really been the genesis of why we think we can manage through it. We talked about the impact. We talked about actions that we're taking to mitigate that. And more importantly, we are doing different scenarios. I mean, yesterday, after earnings, when we received news about certain tariffs, we went back and game planned that through another scenario. So we're working through different scenarios.

It's an ongoing negotiation.  We've had every major country in the world and a lot of the smaller ones come to us and they're fully engaged in negotiations.

I think going back to, again, President Trump's first term, I remember in the very first days  of the administration, Bob Lighthizer, Wilbur Ross, myself, were negotiating directly with the Canadians, many of whom are still in charge of their trade policy. And we were negotiating with both the Mexicans  and the canadians in the mexicans were pure joy did deal with you know they they were they were tough negotiators but they were reasonable fair negotiators the canadians were very very difficult and they've always been very difficult and i think uh... what what the canadian leadership these understand as opposed to the canadian people which we'd love is that this this is waving his big bad retaliation  at the United States of America? I mean, no, they shouldn't be doing that kind of thing. They just don't have the weight in terms of any advantage they might have at us. So I would just urge Canada to, the Canadian citizens to urge their leaders to negotiate fairly with us because, look, every country that we're negotiating with, it's just a fact, they have higher tariffs than we do. They have bigger non-tariff barriers.  We run these massive trade deficits with many of them. How does that happen if trade's fair? It doesn't. So that's all.

Section 232 basically goes on the presumption that if imports  basically putting American capacity out of business in a way which harms the United States, he has the right to offset that. So whether it's steel and aluminum, or whether it's copper where we just made a major announcement on that, or whether it's pharmaceuticals, the endgame for the 232 tariffs is  is to strengthen our defense industrial base, our manufacturing base, and in the case of pharmaceuticals, our health industrial base. Again, as a veteran of the first Trump term, I was the guy, the Defense Production Act policy coordinator  who was in charge of getting all the medicines and the PPE and getting the vaccine thing jump-started and all of that. And we learned some very harsh lessons there. Certainly, there was just incredible rhetoric from China at one point where they were going to drown us in a sea of virus and withhold  things from us if we dared say that the virus was from the Wuhan lab. I mean, that's out there. Just go look at that. But it was also true that every one of our allies, when push came to shove,  They weren't with us, so it was every nation on their own.

There have been questions about whether it adds to deficit and debt, and you have said just the opposite, that combined with tariff revenues, you will turn two to three trillion dollars in deficit spending to a two to three trillion dollar surplus.

But Powell, I mean, let's not conflate those two. Let me talk first about the big beautiful bill, economics. It's fairly straightforward. The way it works is there's this thing called the Congressional Budget Office. We talk about it a lot already.  When you do a bill like that, it's the CBO that does the official forecast."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 492.628, "text": "And you want dynamic story."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 493.489, "text": "And historically, they've just been far more wrong than right, dating back to the first term. And so all you got to know about the CBO forecast this time around is that it assumes a 1.8 rate of economic growth, which we think is way too low.  And from that 1.8, and they don't put in any dynamic effects to speak of, and when they try to do that they screwed that up to whatever, they came up with a two to three trillion dollar increase in the debt. Okay? It's like, no, wait a minute. Here's what you're not doing. Two things. One is that if you simply increase the growth rate,  by one percent we did in the first term cbo got it wrong same way in the first term you raise a couple of trillion dollars as you get get almost a zero okay you get the neutrality they didn't count the tariff revenues and that's like that's a truly normal executive branch not from congress they can't technical but they should have counted it because  it counts towards the debt. I mean, look at it, $100 billion in, I don't know, the first six months. We're going to have a situation where if you simply do the numbers right for the big, beautiful bill, it's a significant reduction in the debt. And what that'll do, if you want to segue to Jay Powell, what that'll do is it'll actually lower yields  and interest rates because we'll have to finance less. Now, with respect to Powell, I think there's a strong argument that can be made that he's at least 50 basis points above where he should be, and we should be in a place where we should be 50 basis points lower now, moving towards even lower. And let's just deconstruct what 50 basis points too high means. That's about a quarter to a half point of GDP growth reduction.  And that in turn means about 500,000 to 750,000 fewer jobs that we'll create because of J-PAL. It's a couple of hundred billion dollars in lost output and there's billions lost in tax revenues. Then when you go from there, and I was watching Lael, I'm sure you have Lael Brainard.  I saw her on a other network yesterday and she has no clue. It's like she was talking about the big beautiful bill and Powell and all this stuff, but 20 to 30 percent of our debt is financed by short-term debt. That's the way they roll that.  So, if you look at a half point more on the short-term debt, that's a couple hundred billion dollars that you build into the debt over 10 years. That's real money. Mortgage rates, average family, $400,000 30-year mortgage, that's over $1,000 a year. And then, this is the last point, a trillion dollars of revolving credit card debt, that's about $5 billion more  that consumers pay. So this idea of what's wrong with weighting? I'll tell you what's wrong with weighting, all those costs. And what's wrong with lowering them now? And if you get it wrong and inflation heats up, just put it in reverse. We used to do that. Fed policy used to be uncertain by design to keep the bond market and everybody else  with discipline.

And when you see 10-year yields going down significantly like they have been doing, that should tell Jerome Powell that the short-run rates should be coming down significantly.  And that's not happening. And let me just, on the Powell thing, let's be clear. It's like this op-ed I had in The Hill basically looked at all the Fed chairmen we've had over the last, I don't know, 40 years and ranked them. Who was good and who was bad.  And there's an argument that he was the worst. And if you look at, like, Arthur Burns, 72, helps Nixon get reelected, sets off the stagflation. G. William Miller is in the middle of that mix, sits on his hands.  He was the other lawyer in the mix besides Powell, totally unqualified. You went through Greenspan, Bernanke, fast forward to Powell. Greenspan, not understanding how the dot-com was going to bring productivity and allow you to go forward without inflation.  But Powell has made three major blunders. In the first term, he raised rates too fast. He was like too early, Powell. And that's been documented by the Fed itself. He made a mistake. In the second term, this is what \u2013 and you folks were right here on this set, and I wonder  why you might not have been asking about Jay Powell.
