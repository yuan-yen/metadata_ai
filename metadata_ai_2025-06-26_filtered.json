With President Trump as Commander-in-Chief, the world is a much safer place. After decades in which past Presidents coddled and enabled the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, President Trump finally ended the immediate threat of a nuclear Iranian regime.  Following President Trump's command, the most powerful military in the history of the world executed massive precision strikes on three of the Iranian regime's key nuclear facilities. The objective of Operation Midnight Hammer was to destroy the regime's nuclear enrichment capacity and stop the grave nuclear threat posed to the United States, Israel, and the rest of the free world. The mission, which will go down in the history books, was an overwhelming success.  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Rays and Kane covered the operation in great detail at their briefing this morning at the Pentagon, and I encourage every American to watch it. As President Trump has said repeatedly, the United States of America has the greatest, fiercest, and bravest armed forces ever to stride the face of this Earth, and we couldn't be more grateful and proud of our nation's warriors.  The Iranian regime was weeks away from being able to produce a nuclear weapon that would threaten the entire world before President Trump took this decisive action on Saturday night to obliterate their nuclear capabilities. The contrast in leadership could not be more clear. Barack Obama and Joe Biden sent pallets of cash, American taxpayer dollars, in a failed attempt to buy the Iranian regime's compliance with a weak and ineffective deal.  President Trump sent a fleet of American warplanes to destroy Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. The United States and the entire world are safer because of this President's decisiveness. Despite agenda-driven leaks by the fake news media aimed at undermining this incredible accomplishment achieved by President Trump and our brave fighter pilots, there is broad consensus emerging already that Iran's nuclear capabilities were, indeed, destroyed.  The United States, Israel, the United Nations, and even Iran all agree they can no longer build a nuclear weapon. So what did the President \u2014 why did the President immediately turn to obliterating after the Iranian nuclear threat? Securing peace. Within 48 hours of the devastating strike, President Trump and his team brokered a historic ceasefire between Israel and Iran and officially ended the 12-day war.  The Middle East is now shifting away from chaos and bloodshed and moving toward the beginning stages of a new era of peace and stability that President Trump has long called on them to achieve. This was unthinkable at this time last week, and this is what peace through strength looks like. Under President Trump, America will relentlessly advance our interests without being dragged into endless wars.  His fearless leadership guarantees America is once again respected across the world. Just look at what he was able to accomplish at the NATO Summit in the Netherlands. Many of you were there. Our allies agreed to invest 5 percent of their GDP annually in defense because President Trump demanded it. This will be the most significant reinforcement of NATO's collective defense in the history of the NATO Alliance.  And as a result, the United States of America will carry less of the burden, and our NATO allies will be stronger than ever before. As NATO Secretary General Ruda put it, for too long, one ally, the United States, and our taxpayers, I may add, carried too much of the burden of that commitment.  And that changes today. President Trump made this change possible. We will produce trillions more for our common defense to make us stronger and fairer by equalizing spending between America and our allies. This is the Trump effect. This is what the President meant when he declared that America is back.  Now back here at home, Americans are paying much cheaper prices for gasoline this summer as both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times pointed out today. Here's how the Wall Street Journal put it. Hitting the road this summer won't bring as much of a big hit to your wallet. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is about 23 cents cheaper than this time last year. Analysts say plentiful supply is expected to keep prices down in the coming months.  These are the cheapest gas prices at this point of the summer since 2021. And despite all the doom casting from liberal pundits, oil prices on Tuesday were lower than before the Israel-Iran conflict began. As President Trump continues to unleash American energy, our country will have even more efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to protect our national security and fuel our people.  Later this afternoon, here at the White House, the President will host a one-big-beautiful event in the East Room to rally Republicans to get the one-big-beautiful bill across the finish line. At that event, he will be joined by everyday Americans from across the country who will massively benefit from the common-sense policies and provisions within this bill. This is the largest tax cut for working and middle-class Americans in history, and it's going to put more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans.  Families will see an average increase in take-home pay of more than $10,000 per year. Americans earning between $30,000 and $80,000 per year will see a 15 percent tax cut. Overtime and tipped workers will save thousands of dollars annually. And our amazing seniors will receive historic financial relief by reducing the tax burden on their Social Security benefits.  Simply put, this bill is going to unlock the golden age of America. And we look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to see this bill on the President's desk for signature by Independence Day. Here in our new media seat today, we have Colin Anderson with the Washington Free Beacon, who will kick off our question and answer. Colin, go ahead."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 368.715, "text": " Thank you, Caroline. We reported yesterday on a briefing from the Israeli Defense Minister in which she said the U.S. and Israel are working together to monitor any attempts from Iran to rebuild their nuclear program, and also that if Iran was to do so, the U.S. and Israel would work together to once again destroy that nuclear program. Does that align with the President's thinking?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 386.025, "text": " Look, the president, as I said in those opening remarks, Colin, and thanks for being with us today, views the Middle East on its way to peace and prosperity. And the president used strength on Saturday night. The whole world saw that the United States is indeed the most lethal fighting force in the world with those precision strikes on Saturday evening.  But the President wants peace. He always has. And right now, we're on a diplomatic path with Iran. The President and his team, namely Special Envoy Whitkoff, continue to be in communication with the Iranians and especially our Gulf and Arab partners in the region to come to an agreement with Iran.  As for our alliance with the State of Israel and that friendship and that partnership between the United States and the State of Israel, I would argue it has never been stronger. And we see a new era in which perhaps some of these Gulf and Arab states can sign on to the Abraham Accords. That was one of the President's most signature accomplishments in his first term, and he'd like to see more of those countries sign on in this second term. And so we look forward to sustaining a long and durable  peace in the region, and the President wants to do that through a diplomatic solution. But as he proved on Saturday night, he's not willing \u2013 he's not afraid to use strength if we need to do it.

And as I said, this administration is always focused on diplomacy and peace, and we want to ensure we can get to a place where Iran agrees to a non-enrichment civil nuclear program. And there are many other requests that the United States has. Those details continue to really \u2014 they're just starting. Of course, the operation was just on Saturday night, but we are in touch.

I've heard him answer it at press conferences and at gaggles. He just spoke about it on Air Force One. The deadline is not critical. The President can simply provide these countries with a deal if they refuse to make us one by the deadline. And that means the President can pick a reciprocal tariff rate that he believes is advantageous for the United States and for the American worker. And he will continue to do that. But as for the deals, our United States Trade Ambassador, Jameson Greer,  I speak to him frequently. He's working very hard, and he has had very good and productive discussions with many of our key trading partners."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 611.192, "text": "And on the one big, beautiful bill, there's conversations on the Hill right now about the Medicaid cuts.

He wants to get rid of the waste, fraud, and abuse, and they are working to do that in the Senate right now. Jennifer. A follow-up on that, on the big, beautiful bill. Is there enough time for Congress to work through the issues it needs to work through? I'm saying, does the President need to move back his deadline a little bit?  We expect that bill to be on the president's desk for signature by July 4th. I know that there was a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian this morning. Look, this is part of the process. This is part of the inner workings of the United States Senate. But the president is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day.  Is there a date set for the Prime Minister to visit the White House yet? Is he coming in a couple weeks? There isn't a date, but the Prime Minister has expressed interest in coming to the White House to meet with the President and come to Washington. The President is obviously very open to that, but we don't have a date when we do. We'll let you all know. Kate.  The President suggested he was open to sending more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine. Is that going to happen? And were there any other assurances that he made directly to Zelensky when they met? I'll let the President speak on that. That was a private conversation between he and President Zelensky. But the meeting was a good meeting, and it was a meeting towards progress. And the President, as he said, repeatedly wants to see this war come to an end. But I'll let him speak on that specific point.  And Whitkoff yesterday suggested that there would be more countries signing on to the Abraham Accords. What's the timeline on that, and which countries specifically is the administration looking to have signed on? Well, the president is certainly hopeful that more countries in the region will sign on to the Abraham Accords again. We want to see a long,  withstanding endurable peace in the Middle East, and that's the way to do it. And when the president met with the new president of Syria, that was one of the requests that he made for Syria to sign on to the Abraham Accords. I don't have a timeline for you, but this administration wants to see that happen, and our partners in the region should know that. Rachel. Thanks so much. Just to follow back up on the meeting that the president mentioned about wanting to have this meeting with the Iranians next week, clearly there's a willingness here from the administration to want to meet with Iranian officials.  What is the holdup here in trying to schedule it? Are you experiencing any resistance from the Iranians? No, have some patience. We just had this strike on Saturday night. The president secured a ceasefire. A lot has happened in the last week. He was just in the Netherlands. Now he's back home to have a big event this afternoon on the one big beautiful bill and get our domestic priorities across the finish line. So we'll get there. And like I said, we're in constant communication.  One more, just on the goal of the meeting. The President mentioned yesterday that it may not be necessary to have an agreement with the Iranians. What is the purpose? What would be the goal of this meeting? Again, to continue moving forward towards a longstanding peace in the Middle East.

The President had some harsh words for both Israel and Iran on Tuesday as he was departed from the NATO summit after they both violated the ceasefire.

Can you share what other assessments are currently underway to get to the bottom of just how effective these strikes were?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 899.627, "text": " Yes. Well, I can assure you what the CIA director said, that when we look at the entirety of the intelligence that we have to this date, it concludes that these strikes on Iranians, the Iranian nuclear facilities, were absolutely successful. It was a total obliteration, as the president said. And not only does our own intelligence say that, but also the Iranian foreign minister has said that. We saw Israel conclude the same thing based on their own intelligence. We also had the United Nations say that as well.  I think the only other time the United Nations, Israel, Iran, and the United States has agreed on something is that the sky is blue. But they all agree that Iran's nuclear facilities were completely demolished. And I would just like to reemphasize, you mentioned this was a low-confidence preliminary intelligence assessment. And the entirety of that assessment was not leaked to the media. Only tidbits of that assessment  were  bits and pieces of an intel assessment to push a false narrative. And it's to the same reporter, I will add, Natasha Bertrand of CNN, who has done this in the past. In 2020, it was Natasha Bertrand who had 51 intelligence analysts falsely lie to her, but she still put it on paper for some reason, that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation.  We all know that's not true, right? We can all agree on that now. That was a lie from the intelligence community. Also in 2020, this same reporter, Natasha Bertrand, wrote that a top intel agency ruled out the man-made lab leak theory of the coronavirus origins. Again, the president was right about that.  Reporter wrote a lie from the intelligence community to seek a narrative she wanted to prove. And guess what? We now know that's the truth. Also, in 2024, Bertrand pushed the suckers and losers hoax. She also pushed the fine people hoax, which was taking the president's words purposely.  out of context. And then last October, and I believe this is notable, Natasha Bertrand published an article in Politico from the intelligence agency. She said that John Ratcliffe was speaking without any evidence when he said Iran was attempting to undermine President Trump's presidential campaign.  And then we, of course, found out that was absolutely true. In fact, the Biden administration declassed an Intel report which said they had high confidence that Iran had done exactly what Ratcliffe alleged. They did run an influence campaign to hurt President Trump's candidacy. In fact, we know the Iranians tried to take President Trump's life.  And so this is a reporter who has been, unfortunately, used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government to push fake and false narratives. She should be ashamed of herself. And that's not what reporting is. Journalism is trying to find the facts and the truth. And this week, we saw this same reporter being used to push a fake narrative to try to undermine the president of the United States and, more importantly, the brave fighter pilots who conducted one of the most successful operations in United States history. And I think the American people fully know  that this operation was a complete and total success. Elizabeth. Thank you, Caroline. The Miami Herald recently published a story saying the Trump administration was targeting migrant foster children. The Trump administration has denounced this as false. Could you clarify the Trump administration's position on protecting migrant children, particularly the 300,000 lost under the Biden administration?  Yes, I saw that Miami Herald article yesterday, and I was aghast at the headline. It's egregious to accuse this administration of trying to target foster children. That is not at all what is happening at the Department of Homeland Security. And I learned that the Department of Homeland Security actually tried to work in good faith with this reporter to get this story right, to explain that this administration is trying to protect foster children. We are trying to keep children out of harm's way.  Even if that means their parents are not law-abiding citizens, we want to protect children, unlike the previous administration, which allowed children to be trafficked and raped, and in some cases killed, because of the open border policies. Unfortunately, the Miami Herald just  completely degraded themselves with this report, despite having a full list of facts from the Department of Homeland Security. It's another example of fake news. And the May border numbers speak for themselves. Not a single illegal alien was allowed into this country because of this administration's border policies in the month of May. That means not a single child was allowed into this country, possibly with human smugglers or human traffickers. And we know that was happening at the rate of thousands and thousands of children every single month.  in the previous administration for four years, and you didn't see any reporting of that from the Miami Herald. But now they're trying to accuse this administration, and we tried to give them the facts, and they refused to report them. So thank you for bringing that report to light. Ayesha. Good to see you again. You too. I know you're looking for this. You're usually on the Hill. I know. I'm here today. I know you're looking for this leaker. Is it your belief, I know you said earlier you're not sure if it's on Capitol Hill or at the Pentagon, but is it your belief that it might be at  In Capitol Hill and how confident are you that you'll find this leaker? Well, I'm not personally looking for the leaker The FBI is looking for the leaker So you'll have to ask them in the Department of Justice in in terms of this investigation But you know leaking top-secret classified Intelligence is is a crime and people need to be held accountable for that crime  just ask you about how you're going to be limiting intel to Congress. What would you say to lawmakers who say they have oversight privileges, they need this information? This administration wants to ensure that classified intelligence is not ending up in irresponsible hands and that people who have the privilege  of viewing this top-secret classified information are being responsible with it. And unfortunately, clearly, someone who had their hands on this \u2014 and it was a very few people, a very few number of people in our government who saw this report \u2014 that person was irresponsible with it. And we need to get to the bottom of it, and we need to strengthen that process to protect our national security and protect the American public.  Mary Margaret, go ahead. Thank you, Caroline. Sure. You just laid out a lot of different stories about disinformation that Natasha, excuse me, that Natasha Batran had pushed during her time at Politico and at CNN. Why would any member of the Trump administration leak anything to her? Well, again, as I just said, we're investigating who that leaker was. It could have been someone in the intelligence community or it could have been someone on Capitol Hill who had access to this document. We are, the FBI is searching for that person.

Does the White House have a statement on that ruling? And would the President support a standalone bill from Congress to defund Planned Parenthood at a federal level, rather than let each state determine it? I'll let the President speak.  on that legislative priority. But as for the Supreme Court ruling, the president has always maintained that Americans should not be forced to violate their conscience and their religious liberty by having their tax dollars fund abortions. And we're glad the Supreme Court ruled on that side today, or yesterday. And then on Iran, but on a domestic matter, in January, President Trump revoked security details for several former administrations, including  Mike Pompeo, Mark Milley, and Joel Bolton. Given the heightened tensions with Iran right now, is he considering restoring those security details? That's not under consideration right now. Fran. If I could follow up on trade, and then I have a question about the bill as well. Are you saying at this point that there's no plans to extend that July 8th and July 9th deadline? I mean, especially with everything that's been going on from Iran to the tax bill on Capitol Hill, is that under consideration at all at this point?  Perhaps it could be extended, but that's a decision for the president to make. And as far as the bill itself goes, since the president has been back, what has he been doing beyond the event that he's having later today to try and get wobbly senators on board? Is he making phone calls, twisting arms? Is he having some people over to the White House? Can you tell us more about that? There have been meetings at the White House this week. I saw some senators rolling out of the Oval Office the other day. And the president remains on the phones talking to his friends in the Senate when necessary. And when they call, he picks up the phone.  And I think that's why they greatly trust and respect his leadership. And we're having that big event later this afternoon at 4 o'clock. I would encourage you all to tune in. We're going to have some great everyday Americans who are in attendance. We'll have some tipped delivery drivers. I think we're going to have a barber from the great state of Arkansas here in attendance. We're going to have some law enforcement officers, some Border Patrol agents, and Tom Homan will be speaking as well. So the point of this event is to show the American people how this bill works for them and how there are provisions in this bill that will  changed their lives. I'll let the President speak on that if he wishes. I don't share details about his private meetings without his permission. Emily, go ahead.  Federal law bars hiring somebody based on their race or sex, but do you also object to universities working harder to make sure they have a diverse group of candidates to consider, and do you expect more investigations like this from DOJ? I have not seen that investigation from the Department of Justice, but I can certainly check in. What I can tell you, it's the position  of this president, that we want to restore a merit-based society and culture in the United States of America, where people are not hired nor are they promoted based on their color of their skin or their gender. The president wants people to be hired in the workforce because of their merit and their skill, and I think most Americans agree with that. I'll take one more. Carrie, because I promised you earlier.  So the Ayatollah Khomeini came out and said that Iran will, quote, never surrender to the U.S. That being said, what remains to do with the possible responses from Iranian proxies in the region and even in the U.S. ?  We saw the Ayatollah's video, and when you have a totalitarian regime, you have to save face. I think any common-sense, open-minded person knows the truth about the precision strikes on Saturday night. They were wildly successful. And it's what led to the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, which the president is very grateful for.  And the United States of America remains prepared to defend our assets and our personnel in the region. And again, I would just emphasize the success of the strike that took place on Saturday night. And the world is a safer place because of it. Thanks, guys, for coming today. And you'll see the President at 4 o'clock.

And you can compare that to the European strategies, which have moved quite quickly into renewable power, solar, offshore wind, hydrogen. And I think the proof is in the pudding as far as how the markets have received these. You can see Exxon and Chevron are currently trading at about 30% higher on a forward earnings basis than the European group. So the market has certainly told them what they think.  The issue with the Europeans is that they've been pulled in two different directions.

Countries will not like that. So I think this is probably the number one reason why it hasn't happened so far. I continue to think it's the reason why it won't happen, but I would not be surprised, Shell, to be interested in something like  BP's onshore US shale business, which is called BPX, maybe their Gulf of Mexico portfolio, which is where there'd be huge operational overlap and potential cost synergies, offshore Brazil in the deep water, and particularly BP's LNG business, which is about half of what Shells is,  But combining those, it would be controlling roughly a quarter of the global LNG market.

So it's, it's an interesting lesson in terms of, uh, maybe how not to run a business. I mean, Walgreens was formed about a decade ago when it acquired a boots Alliance, the European businesses that it owns, and then it's subsequently sold the wholesale business in Europe. And now it's just Walgreens and boots pretty much. And then they have another little bit of, uh, healthcare services that I acquired a couple of years ago, but.  A pharmacy's been in a structural decline for the last decade. Rite Aid tried to sell to them, that deal got squashed from antitrust purposes. Rite Aid has filed for bankruptcy twice now. There's a whole lot of pressure in this industry, and that pressure's coming from the payers, the PBMs.  the insurance companies. And so it's an interesting time because I think we've probably reached the bottom where there's no more blood to be kind of squeezed from the stone from pharmacies. And we're seeing new reimbursement models come about, what they call like cost plus, like Mark Cuban's model, cost plus drugs, where the PBMs are actually forcing this on the pharmacies as a payment model.

Drug prices are just all over the place.  And so one of the reasons the PBMs come under such fire is they're the ones kind of controlling that system of pricing and making it not transparent.

Jake Silverman, he's the one we got. Semiconductor analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. He joins us here in our Bloomberg Interactive Brokerage Studio. Talk to us about Micron Technology. What did they report and what's it tell you about the semi-space?  Yeah, so they had pretty strong results last night. It was a beaten raise, very strong on earnings based on strong gross margins.  The bit growth was really what drove the strength in the quarter. And pricing was relatively weak based on mix, but generally in the right upward trajectory. And really, the way to think about memory is it's pretty ubiquitous across electronics. You can think about smartphones, PCs, servers, both traditional and AI.  You know, everything that you have that's in your pocket, on your desk, sitting somewhere in your house, it's going to have memory or storage, some combination of the two potentially as well."}, {"keywords": ["Apple", "Trade", "Tariffs", "Export", "Import"], "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1107.392, "text": " So we all know that demand for AI computing is really high right now.

Where are they in line?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 37, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1121.535, "text": "Yeah, so generally speaking, it's important to keep in mind that Micron and a lot of the memory peers really trade on a cyclical basis.  quite a few inventory buildups, and then companies do restocking. And in the past, there wasn't really as much of an AI story for Micron specifically, but with high bandwidth memory of some of their other products, you can think about high capacity solid state drives and high capacity DRAM modules. That has all been an AI story for the most part, and we've seen a lot of tailwinds in that business.  Micron continues to gain share, execute very well. It was a pretty important part of their story for this past quarter and heading into the end of this fiscal year. I said at the beginning, I didn't know a lot about Micron Technologies. No surprise, the stock's up 50% year to date. What's the story there?  Yeah, so there were definitely a lot of worries once we got into this sort of tariff-related potential headwinds in April. And that really was a major drag on the stock price, because there was potential for higher prices across all of their product lines. And that could really be a hindrance to demand for a lot of consumer-related specifically products, like PCs, smartphones, USB drives. And so as that kind of  you know, headwind kind of faded away. What's happened is Micron has gotten those tailwinds from AI and better pricing. And so there's just a couple of different factors that have actually been really helping them out. They've continued to generate solid free cash flow over the next, over the last several quarters. And the expectation is for that to continue. That's very important in an industry that's very cyclical."}, {"keywords": ["Apple", "Trade", "Tariffs", "Export", "Import"], "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1226.296, "text": " So it said on the conference call that analysts were really asking the CEO questions about HBM.

It's attached pretty much directly to the GPUs that NVIDIA sells that end up in these big server stacks. And so high bandwidth memory has been an area where Micron has been gaining share  SK hynix was the incumbent and micron has been executing very well on their roadmap. First on eight high as you'll hear in the call, right, but also 12 high as well. So eight high is for Blackwell and the 12 high is for Blackwell ultra GB 300 that's coming out. So that procurement cycle has already kicked in and they're going to see a pretty strong demand over the next coming months and quarters for, uh, for their 12 high stack products. And it's really all AI related.  Demand for HBM, it's AI. So that takes us back to the big, big picture. And I know you and your technology research colleagues at Bloomberg Intelligence, you do a ton of work on AI. You've got what I think is the definitive report on AI. So folks, if you haven't seen it, go to the Bloomberg BI Go, and that's the definitive report on Wall Street, I think, on AI.  We never talk about ADA more because it's tariffs all day, every day. Just give us the latest on the AI story. Investors you talk to, the clients you talk to, are they still as bullish on AI as they were, say, last year? Yeah, I think there's a lot of optimism still in AI. For Micron specifically, it's been, you know, we've been talking about NVIDIA kind of beating and raising for so many quarters and maybe a little bit of a slowdown last quarter or so. But Micron, the story was so early.  They still like a very small percentage of their revenue is AI related. So it's kind of interesting how there's been a little bit of a dichotomy in terms of AI not being the same tailwind for Micron that you'd see for some other companies like Nvidia. But there's still a lot of optimism in the investor community and there's quite a few people trying to understand where does Micron really benefit from AI and how much more infrastructure expansion  for AI, hyperscale CapEx, how does that benefit Micron? How much more do we need to see for Micron to really benefit heavily from that? All right, Jake, thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.

Tom beat him out in training camp and became the number two. And then, unfortunately, when Baletso got hurt, Brady got his opportunity. And he played well. We had a good team. He played well.

And you could see his leadership start to take over amongst the rookies, not as a team leader, but as the rookies. And then once he became the quarterback, then his leadership really accelerated.  He worked out with the offensive lineman. He hung out with the offensive lineman. He was just one of the guys. He wasn't some prima donna quarterback. He connected to everybody.

So we just came out yesterday with a survey of almost 64.  Yeah, yeah, 164 private equity leaders. And what they're saying, which is now consistent with what we're seeing, more optimism about deal flow. Opening up before the second half starts of this year, about 25% said more deal flow, another 25%, so a total of about 50 saying it's coming before the first half of next year. Why is that happening? Because the deals that they're looking at  have isolated tariff risk already. So for example, hot topic right now, pest control businesses. Why is that a hot topic? Because you know who doesn't care about fed cuts? Ants and termites. They are indifferent. All right. Why don't they care? Because it's more of a seasonal thing. And by the way, I don't know if you are  Experiencing lots of flies in the kitchen during this hot weather, right? So pest control firms are opportunities because very little equipment, not a lot of labor, and repeatable revenue sources you have occurring. How many times have you fired your pest control? Very few. Once they're in. And these are small businesses. So private equity is like, you know what? We're going to consolidate these mom and pops and create bigger platforms and sell them. And those businesses, because they're... You could have done that.  they're strong through various cycles, right? All of a sudden have greater value. So now what we're seeing in our shop is a tick up of deal flow, which means more realization. So stay tuned, Paul, it's coming. The headlines is private credit is trying to find a new valuation and maybe private equity too. You mentioned there's $3 trillion looking to exit out there in some way, somehow.  go through the process right now about somebody, an endowment or whoever has to clear, they have to sell private credit. How does that occur on a less heated Thursday in June? Yeah, so what they're doing now is they're coming to us and they're saying, Randy, you know, you guys have a really successful platform. There's certain strategies we really like about your business.  we have these other businesses that we want to get out of. Okay, can you help us to move our portfolio from strategies that we thought were going to work out but over the last several years has not been as resilient as we thought or the returns haven't been there. So we sit down on a consulting basis with these firms and we say we can help you get into a, let's call it a more resilient area with better returns and lower risk. What's the haircut everyone wants to know?  How much haircut are people taking? Well, it depends on the risk asset class that they are currently in, right? So if they're in a distress class and they're not getting the volume, which by the way, historically has been the case because where's the recession? Everybody's saying, hey, the great thing about private credit is, you know, you've done really well, but there hasn't been a real recession.  which is true. You know, there have been little crises, as one of my friends at Moody's says, there have been quizzes, not tests."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 42, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1157.329, "text": "Okay."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 43, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1158.15, "text": "But you know what? Some of the asset classes have failed the quizzes, right? If you fail a quiz, you're still failing. So I do think that what we're seeing now from our survey and what we're seeing in our pipeline  So, April was kind of a low month, given tariffs and everything else. May was a bit of a comeback. June, we have seen 50% higher deal flow than we saw June of last year. So, I think this $3 trillion, Tom, that you mentioned  globally of corporates waiting to exit, that ice cube is starting to melt. We're seeing it in our pipeline. We're seeing it in global M&A data. The folks at London Stock Exchange keep track of this. M&A for 2025 through the middle of June is up, you know, over 22 and 23. So I do think that it's coming back.  Where are the banks here as you and your private credit folks look at deals? Where are the banks these days? Because you guys focus on middle market and where are the banks? Yeah. So great segue. So kudos to Carmen Arroya and Ellen Schneider, your reporters who came out yesterday. I guess it was Tuesday. Headline JP Morgan traders shut out of private  credit market. Okay, what's going on there is they're going out with their list, you know, I worked there, you worked there, right? You know, remember they go out with lists, hey, we'd like to buy these loans, and here's a bunch of loans, okay? Or we want to sell those loans, here's the list. And what your reporters basically said, which is really true, is that, you know, nobody wants to sell these loans. If I have a  300, I have 300 loans, 300 companies in my senior portfolio and they're doing well. Why would I want to sell them? So while JP is obviously a giant in terms of secondary trading and loans and bonds, everything else in the private markets, it's more challenging because these things are illiquid.

Good to see all of you. With President Trump as Commander-in-Chief, the world is a much safer place. After decades in which past Presidents coddled and enabled the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, President Trump finally ended the immediate threat of a nuclear Iranian regime.  Following President Trump's command, the most powerful military in the history of the world executed massive precision strikes on three of the Iranian regime's key nuclear facilities. The objective of Operation Midnight Hammer was to destroy the regime's nuclear enrichment capacity and stop the grave nuclear threat posed to the United States, Israel, and the rest of the free world. The mission, which will go down in the history books, was an overwhelming success.  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Rays and Kane covered the operation in great detail at their briefing this morning at the Pentagon, and I encourage every American to watch it. As President Trump has said repeatedly, the United States of America has the greatest, fiercest, and bravest armed forces ever to stride the face of this Earth, and we couldn't be more grateful and proud of our nation's warriors.  The Iranian regime was weeks away from being able to produce a nuclear weapon that would threaten the entire world before President Trump took this decisive action on Saturday night to obliterate their nuclear capabilities. The contrast in leadership could not be more clear. Barack Obama and Joe Biden sent pallets of cash, American taxpayer dollars, in a failed attempt to buy the Iranian regime's compliance with a weak and ineffective deal.  President Trump sent a fleet of American warplanes to destroy Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. The United States and the entire world are safer because of this President's decisiveness. Despite agenda-driven leaks by the fake news media aimed at undermining this incredible accomplishment achieved by President Trump and our brave fighter pilots, there is broad consensus emerging already that Iran's nuclear capabilities were, indeed, destroyed.  The United States, Israel, the United Nations, and even Iran all agree they can no longer build a nuclear weapon. So why did the President immediately turn to obliterating after the Iranian nuclear threat? Securing peace. Within 48 hours of the devastating strike, President Trump and his team brokered a historic ceasefire between Israel and Iran and officially ended the 12-day war.  The Middle East is now shifting away from chaos and bloodshed and moving toward the beginning stages of a new era of peace and stability that President Trump has long called on them to achieve. This was unthinkable at this time last week, and this is what peace through strength looks like. Under President Trump, America will relentlessly advance our interests without being dragged into endless wars.  His fearless leadership guarantees America is once again respected across the world. Just look at what he was able to accomplish at the NATO summit in the Netherlands. Many of you were there. Our allies agreed to invest 5 percent of their GDP annually in defense because President Trump demanded it.  This will be the most significant reinforcement of NATO's collective defense in the history of the NATO alliance. And as a result, the United States of America will carry less of the burden, and our NATO allies will be stronger than ever before. As NATO Secretary-General Ruda put it, for too long, one ally, the United States, and our taxpayers, I may add, carried too much of the burden of that commitment.  And that changes today. President Trump made this change possible. We will produce trillions more for our common defense to make us stronger and fairer by equalizing spending between America and our allies. This is the Trump effect. This is what the President meant when he declared that America is back.  Now back here at home, Americans are paying much cheaper prices for gasoline this summer as both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times pointed out today. Here's how the Wall Street Journal put it. Hitting the road this summer won't bring as much of a big hit to your wallet. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is about 23 cents cheaper than this time last year. Analysts say plentiful supply is expected to keep prices down in the coming months.  These are the cheapest gas prices at this point of the summer since 2021. And despite all the doom casting from liberal pundits, oil prices on Tuesday were lower than before the Israel-Iran conflict began. As President Trump continues to unleash American energy, our country will have even more efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to protect our national security and fuel our people.  Later this afternoon here at the White House, the President will host a One Big Beautiful event in the East Room to rally Republicans to get the One Big Beautiful bill across the finish line. At that event, he will be joined by everyday Americans from across the country who will massively benefit from the common-sense policies and provisions within this bill. This is the largest tax cut for working and middle-class Americans in history, and it's going to put more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans.  Families will see an average increase in take-home pay of more than $10,000 per year. Americans earning between $30,000 and $80,000 per year will see a 15 percent tax cut. Overtime and tipped workers will save thousands of dollars annually. And our amazing seniors will receive historic financial relief by reducing the tax burden on their Social Security benefits.  Simply put, this bill is going to unlock the age, the golden age of America. And we look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to see this bill on the President's desk for signature by Independence Day. Here in our new media seat today, we have Colin Anderson with the Washington Free Beacon, who will kick off our question and answer.

The President  And his team, namely Special Envoy Whitkoff, continue to be in communication with the Iranians and especially our Gulf and Arab partners in the region to come to an agreement with Iran. As for our alliance with the State of Israel and that friendship and that partnership between the United States and the State of Israel, I would argue it has never been stronger. And we see a new era in which perhaps some of these Gulf and Arab states can sign on to the Abraham Accords.  That was one of the President's most signature accomplishments in his first term, and he'd like to see more of those countries sign on in this second term.

This is part of the inner workings of the United States Senate. But the President is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day.  Is there a date set for the Prime Minister to visit the White House yet? Is he coming in a couple weeks? There isn't a date, but the Prime Minister has expressed interest in coming to the White House to meet with the President and come to Washington. The President is obviously very open to that, but we don't have a date when we do. We'll let you all know. Kate.  The President suggested he was open to sending more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine. Is that going to happen? And were there any other assurances that he made directly to Zelensky when they met? I'll let the President speak on that. That was a private conversation between he and President Zelensky. But the meeting was a good meeting, and it was a meeting towards progress. And the President, as he said, repeatedly wants to see this war come to an end. But I'll let him speak on that specific.  And Whitkoff yesterday suggested that there would be more countries signing on to the Abraham Accords. Is there \u2013 what's the timeline on that, and which countries specifically is the administration looking to have signed on? Well, the President is certainly hopeful that more countries in the region will sign on to the Abraham Accords. Again, we want to see a long  withstanding endurable peace in the Middle East, and that's the way to do it. And when the President met with the new President of Syria, that was one of the requests that he made for Syria to sign on to the Abraham Accords. I don't have a timeline for you, but this administration wants to see that happen, and our partners in the region should know that. Rachel. Thanks so much. Just to follow back up on the meeting that the President mentioned about wanting to have this meeting with the Iranians next week, clearly there's a willingness here from the administration to want to meet with Iranian officials.  What is the holdup here in trying to schedule it? Are you experiencing any resistance from the Iranians? No. Have some patience. We just had this strike on Saturday night. The President secured a ceasefire. A lot has happened in the last week. He was just in the Netherlands. Now he's back home to have a big event this afternoon on the one big, beautiful bill and get our domestic priorities across the finish line. So we'll get there. And like I said, we're in constant communication. And just one more, just on the goal of the meeting.

Well, I can assure you what the CIA director said, that when we look at the entirety of the intelligence that we have to this date, it concludes that these strikes on Iranians, the Iranian nuclear facilities, were absolutely successful. It was a total obliteration, as the President said. And not only does our own intelligence say that, but also the Iranian foreign minister has said that. We saw Israel conclude the same thing based on their own intelligence. We also had the United Nations say that as well.  I think the only other time the United Nations, Israel, Iran, and the United States has agreed on something is that the sky is blue, but they all agree that Iran's nuclear facilities were completely demolished. And I would just like to reemphasize, you mentioned this was a low-confidence preliminary intelligence assessment, and the entirety of that assessment was not leaked to the media. Only tidbits of that assessment were leaked to CNN. And we have seen this playbook run before.  where you have people in the intelligence community or perhaps on Capitol Hill, we don't know, but I believe the FBI is investigating to find out who that leaker was because it's illegal, and they should be held accountable for that, leaked bits and pieces of an intel assessment to push a false narrative. And it's to the same reporter, I will add, Natasha Bertrand of CNN, who has done this in the past. In 2020, it was Natasha Bertrand  who had 51 intelligence analysts falsely lie to her, but she still put it on paper for some reason, that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation. We all know that's not true, right? We can all agree on that now. That was a lie from the intelligence community. Also in 2020, this same reporter, Natasha Bertrand, wrote that a top Intel agency ruled out the man-made lab leak theory of the coronavirus origins. Again, the president was right about that.  This reporter wrote a lie from the intelligence community to seek a narrative she wanted to prove. And guess what? We now know that's the truth. Also in 2024, Bertrand pushed the suckers and losers hoax. She also pushed the fine people hoax, which was taking the president's words purposely out of context. And then last October, and I believe this is notable, Natasha Bertrand published an article in Politico from the intelligence agency. She said that John Ratcliffe was speaking without any evidence  when he said Iran was attempting to undermine President Trump's presidential campaign. And then we, of course, found out that was absolutely true. In fact, the Biden administration declassed an intel report which said they had high confidence that Iran had done exactly what Ratcliffe alleged. They did run an influence campaign to hurt President Trump's candidacy. In fact, we know the Iranians tried to take President Trump's life.  And so this is a reporter who has been, unfortunately, used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government to push fake and false narratives. She should be ashamed of herself. And that's not what reporting is. Journalism is trying to find the facts and the truth. And this week, we saw this same reporter being used to push a fake narrative to try to undermine the President of the United States and, more importantly, the brave fighter pilots who conducted one of the most successful operations in United States history. And I think the American people fully know  that this operation was a complete and total success. Elizabeth. Thank you, Caroline. The Miami Herald recently published a story saying the Trump administration was targeting migrant foster children. The Trump administration has denounced this as false. Could you clarify the Trump administration's position on protecting migrant children, particularly the 300,000 lost under the Biden administration?  Yes, I saw that Miami Herald article yesterday, and I was aghast at the headline. It's egregious to accuse this administration of trying to target foster children. That is not at all what is happening at the Department of Homeland Security. And I learned that the Department of Homeland Security actually tried to work in good faith with this reporter to get this story right, to explain that this administration is trying to protect foster children. We are trying to keep children out of harm's way.  Even if that means their parents are not law-abiding citizens, we want to protect children, unlike the previous administration, which allowed children to be trafficked and raped, and in some cases killed, because of the open border policies. Unfortunately, the Miami Herald just completely degraded themselves with this report, despite having a full list of facts from the Department of Homeland Security. It's another example of fake news.  And the May border numbers speak for themselves. Not a single illegal alien was allowed into this country because of this administration's border policies in the month of May. That means not a single child was allowed into this country, possibly with human smugglers or human traffickers. And we know that was happening at the rate of thousands and thousands of children every single month.  in the previous administration for four years. And you didn't see any reporting of that from the Miami Herald. But now they're trying to accuse this administration. And we tried to give them the facts, and they refused to report them.

Thank you, Caroline. Earlier today, the President stated that these photos out of Fordow that were showing nuclear materials being removed, suspected of showing that, were just concrete workers. What intelligence is that based upon? Look, the President shared that statement with all of you, and I already answered the question about whether uranium was moved prior to the strike, and the answer is no.  Is there a chance that the DIA report becomes public at any point? I don't think this administration is going to get into the habit of sharing classified, top-secret information.

You've been emphatic about the President's expectations for the one big, beautiful bill to hit that July 4th deadline. You had a big meeting on Capitol Hill yesterday with the Republican Study Committee. Did you walk away from that meeting pleased with what you heard?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1586.864, "text": "Did it bolster your confidence that Congress is able to meet the expectation of the President?  Yes, I did. The camaraderie at the Republican Study Committee was great. Members expressed their feelings about the bill. But as we saw, the bill passed through the House, despite many people believing it could not. So the House is ready to receive this bill back from the Senate so they can pass it and bring it to the president's desk. So it was a great meeting. And Republicans are very unified. And we also talked about the mayoral race in New York City.  and how the victory of the Democratic primary candidate really shows how far left and unhinged the Democrat Party has become. And Republicans truly are on the right side of every issue in this country. We are on the side of no men and women's sports, on the side of low taxes, secure borders. So that was the topic of discussion. And the unity was strong and the camaraderie was high. And I know everyone looks forward to being here at the White House for the bill signing next week.  Sure. Thanks, Caroline. The Supreme Court ruled this morning that South Carolina is allowed to deem Planned Parenthood as not a qualified health care provider, and that will block it from receiving Medicaid funds. Does the White House have a statement on that ruling? And would the President support a standalone bill from Congress to defund Planned Parenthood at a federal level, rather than let each state determine it? I'll let the President speak.  on that legislative priority. But as for the Supreme Court ruling, the President has always maintained that Americans should not be forced to violate their conscience and their religious liberty by having their tax dollars fund abortions. And we're glad the Supreme Court ruled on that side today, or yesterday. And then on Iran, but on a domestic matter, in January, President Trump revoked security details for several former administrations, including Mike Pompeo, Mark Milley, and Joel Bolton.  Given the heightened tensions with Iran right now, is he considering restoring those security details? That's not under consideration right now. Fran. If I could follow up on trade, and then I have a question about the bill as well. Are you saying at this point that there's no plans to extend that July 8th and July 9th deadline? I mean, especially with everything that's been going on from Iran to the tax bill on Capitol Hill, is that under consideration at all at this point? Perhaps it could be extended, but that's a decision for the President to make.  And as far as the bill itself goes, since the President has been back, what has he been doing beyond the event that he's having later today to try and get wobbly senators on board? Is he making phone calls, twisting arms? Is he having some people over to the White House? Can you tell us more about that? There have been meetings at the White House this week. I saw some senators rolling out of the Oval Office the other day. And the President remains on the phones, talking to his friends in the Senate when necessary. And when they call, he picks up the phone. And I think that's why they greatly trust and respect his leadership.  And we're having that big event later this afternoon at 4 o'clock. I would encourage you all to tune in. We're going to have some great everyday Americans who are in attendance. We'll have some tipped delivery drivers. I think we're going to have a barber from the great state of Arkansas here in attendance. We're going to have some law enforcement officers, some Border Patrol agents, and Tom Homan will be speaking as well. So the point of this event is to show the American people how this bill works for them and how there are provisions in this bill that will change their lives.  I don't share details about his private meetings without his permission.  federal law bars hiring somebody based on their race or sex but do you also object to universities working harder to make sure they have a diverse group of candidates to consider and do you expect more investigations like this from DOJ? I have not seen that investigation from the Department of Justice but I can certainly check in. What I can tell you it's the position  of this President, that we want to restore a merit-based society and culture in the United States of America, where people are not hired nor are they promoted based on their color of their skin or their gender. The President wants people to be hired in the workforce because of their merit and their skill, and I think most Americans agree with that. I'll take one more.

But to Trump's benefit and the administration's benefit, the market has absorbed that and moved on. The issues about the Middle East and all the challenges of foreign policy, there was a lot of action the last 10 days ago and a week and a half ago, and now that has been sort of absorbed in the marketplace.  The big elephant in the room is still our deficit issue. You guys have talked about it quite a bit. It's obviously the topic of appropriate conversation. And so I think that is an important topic that still remains. But we talked earlier this year about the decline of US exceptionalism.  I think Mark Twain was right, that my death is a bit premature. And certainly the market has moved on. So I think the tariffs are a little bit off on the side. The foreign policy issues are a little bit off the side right now. The deficit issue is a real issue. We could talk a little bit about what's going on with the dollar. I personally think what's going on with the dollar  I think there was a lot of investors around the globe that invested in U.S. assets and they made money both ways, on the currency and on the underlying assets for almost 10 years. And they turned around and they found themselves really unhedged. And I think you're going to see some pretty good numbers out of the big banks this quarter because investors around the globe have been rushing to hedge their dollar exposure. But I think it's a 10-year catch-up that people just didn't  hedge their portfolios in massive scale.

Some tell me inflation is still a little bit more represented in the economy. We see inflation around 3%, 3, 3.5%. And I don't think it's obvious that the Fed should be cutting right now. I think it is a very legitimate question to be asking what's the trajectory of the Fed activity.  And so I don't think it's a slam dunk decision. I know the market, the futures would tell you three cuts in the rest of the year, three, three and a half cuts. Torsten and I are a bit skeptical on that.

The truth is that the BLS data shouldn't be degraded on any basis, yet the administration is so dramatically, and I hope my Republican colleagues will hear on this, cut back the staffing at BLS  that the BLS has had to significantly cut back on the collection of critical price and inflation data. Normally, BLS staff, when you don't have all the data collected, will estimate about 10% of the inputs into the CPI. Now, with these cutbacks, they've had to estimate close to 30% of the data.

I mean, you look at the big consulting firms,  some of your listeners might not appreciate this, but the big four accounting firms and the strategy consultants won eight and a half billion pounds in national governmental contracts over the last five years alone. So the notion that there is no money to be saved is for the birds. Now it is also true  this country is almost three trillion in national debt. But the bottom line is the British economy is not growing. I mean, talk about 0.7%. That's less than the population is growing just from immigration. If we do not get the British economy growing meaningfully on a per capita basis, this country is headed  to an extremely bad place. The way we're going to do that is by cutting spending on things that are wasteful. We have to get our welfare bill under control and difficult conversations do have to be had about it. Of course there are some people who need benefits, of course that is true, but it has never been easier to get onto benefits. So we have to get the welfare bill per capita down to where it was back in 2019. That will free up a lot of money to reduce the tax burden on working people  And we also have to, by the way, be really honest that we need wealthy international job creators, wealth creators to be here. We don't need them fleeing. We want them here in the UK. That's a big part of what our policy announcement was today.

I want to start with that real quick. I think there's so much news, so many things happening that oftentimes  Big, momentous moments get missed. What President Trump accomplished in NATO yesterday was game-changing and historic. A shift in burden-sharing to European responsibility in NATO that most would have said was impossible at the beginning of his term. But he said NATO needs to pay up. They started in the first term, and here in his second term, we've accelerated that.  32 NATO countries committed to spending 5% of their GDP on defense, on actually investing in the NATO alliance. So I hope with all the ink spilled, all of your outlets find the time to properly recognize this historic change in continental security that other presidents tried to do, other presidents talked about. President Trump accomplished it. It's a huge deal.  I see we're here this morning because in hunting for scandals all the time, in trying to find wedges and spin stories, this press corps and the press corps miss historic moments. You miss historic moments like 5% at NATO, which when you hear, I was in the closed-door briefing. I wish there could have been cameras in there. When you heard the prime ministers and presidents of other countries, to a man and to a woman, looking at President Trump and saying, this never could have happened.  Never would have happened. Seemed impossible five years ago, two years ago, eight years ago. But here we are because of your leadership. If you ask them the question,  I bet they'd say the same thing. But searching for scandals, you miss historic moments, like recruiting at the Pentagon. Historic levels in the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. Yeah, maybe there'll be a little mention here or there, but because it was under President Trump's leadership, because it was because Americans are responding to him as Commander-in-Chief, the press corps doesn't want to write about it.  Or bring us to the topic of the moment, the highly successful strikes in Iran. Let me read the bottom line here. President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history.  And it was a resounding success, resulting in a ceasefire agreement and the end of the 12-day war. There's been a lot of discussion about what happened and what didn't happen. Step back for a second. Because of decisive military action, President Trump created the conditions to end the war, decimating, choose your word, obliterating, destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities.  I want to read some of the assessments that have been provided, because whether it's fake news, CNN, MSNBC, or the New York Times, there's been fawning coverage of a preliminary assessment. I haven't had a chance to read it. Every outlet has breathlessly reported on a preliminary assessment from DIA. I'm looking at it right now. Again, it was preliminary, a day and a half after the actual strike.  When it admits itself in writing that it requires weeks to accumulate the necessary data to make such an assessment, it's preliminary, it points out that it's not been coordinated with the intelligence community at all. There's low confidence in this particular report. It says in the report there are gaps in the information. It says in the report multiple linchpin assumptions are what this assessment, a linchpin assumption, you know what that is? That means your entire premise is predicated on a linchpin. If you're wrong, everything else is wrong.  And yet, still, this report acknowledges it's likely severe damage. Again, this is preliminary. But leaked because someone had an agenda to try to muddy the waters and make it look like this historic strike wasn't successful. I'm going to get to the chairman in a moment because he's going to lay out the particulars for you based on his professional military experience. But here's what other folks are saying. The DIA, they put that report out.  says this is a preliminary low-confidence report and will continue to be refined as additional intelligence becomes available. How about the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission? The devastating U.S. strikes on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable. Have any of these quotes made their way into The New York Times or The Washington Post? MSNBC? CNN?  Any of these quotes? How about this one? This is a new one from the UN, the United Nations. No friend of the United States or certainly Israel often. Here's the head of the UN Atomic Energy Agency this morning, Rafael Grossi. U.S. and Israeli strikes caused enormous damage to Iran's nuclear sites. Don't take my word for it. How about the IDF's chief of staff?  I can say here that the assessment is that we significantly damaged the nuclear program, setting it back by years. I repeat, years. The Iranian foreign minister, the spokesman, our nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure. I'm sure that's an understatement.  John Radcliffe, the director of the CIA, putting out a statement just last night. CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's nuclear program has been severely damaged by recent targeted strikes. This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable, very different than preliminary assessment with low confidence, he's saying historically reliable and accurate source and method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed.  and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years. CIA continues to collect additional reliably sourced information to keep appropriate decision makers fully informed. How about DNI Tulsi Gabbard yesterday? She writes, and I quote, new intelligence confirms what POTUS has stated numerous times. Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed.  Institute for Science and International Security President David Albright. Overall, Israel and US attacks have effectively destroyed Iran's centrifuge enrichment program. Time and time again, I can go down the list. Those that understand, those that see, those that do proper assessments recognize that what the United States military did was historic. And again, before I pass it to the chairman,  Because you, and I mean specifically you, the press, specifically you, the press corps, because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump, because you want him not to be successful so bad,  You have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. Maybe the way the Trump administration has represented them isn't true. So let's take half-truths, spun information, leaked information, and then spin it. Spin it in every way we can to try to cause doubt and manipulate the public mind over whether or not our brave pilots  were successful. How many stories have been written about how hard it is to, I don't know, fly a plane for 36 hours?  Has MSNBC done that story? Has Fox? Have we done the story how hard that is? Have we done it two or three times so that American people understand? How about how difficult it is to shoot a drone from an F-15 or 16 or F-22 or F-35? Or what it's like to man a Patriot battery? Or how hard it is to refuel midair? Giving the American people an understanding of how complex and sophisticated this mission really was.  There are so many aspects of what our brave men and women did that, because of the hatred of this press corps, are undermined because people are trying to leak and spin that it wasn't successful. It's irresponsible. And folks in this room,  are privy to that information because of the proximity here in the Pentagon. It's an important responsibility. And time and time again, classified information is leaked or peddled for political purposes to try to make the President look bad. And what's really happening is you're undermining the success of incredible B-2 pilots and incredible F-35 pilots and incredible refuelers and incredible air defenders who accomplished their mission  set back a nuclear program in ways that other presidents would have dreamed. How about we celebrate that? How about we talk about how special America is, that only we have these capabilities? I think it's too much to ask, unfortunately, for the fake news. So we're used to that. But we also have an opportunity to stand at the podium and read the truth of what's really happening. And the reality is you want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated, choose your word.  This was a historically successful attack, and we should celebrate it as Americans. And it gives us a chance to have peace, a chance to have a deal, and an opportunity to prevent a nuclear Iran, which is something President Trump talked about for 20 years and no other presidents had the courage to actually do.  So with that, I want to hand it over to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. They've done technical analysis on this, not just on the strike, but also on our Patriot defenders and all you need. And Mr. Chairman, I'll hand it over to you."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 603.831, "text": "Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And good morning. And all of you, thank you for thank you for being here.  As a follow-up to my comments on Sunday's press conference, I wanted to give you a few updates this morning on something I'm honored to do as a chairman, and that's a chance to get to talk about some of our service members and the incredible things that they do on behalf of our nation. And I apologize ahead of time for the length and the detail.  Today, I'm going to brief you on a couple things. First, I'm going to talk about our air defenders at Al Udeid in Qatar and their actions on Monday. Then I'm going to walk you through a little bit about the academics that went into the attack against Fordow, the massive ordnance penetrator weapon, and we're going to show a video that highlights the effects that that weapon has. Of course, nobody was down inside the target, so we don't have video from the target.  First, on Monday, as the President has stated, on Monday morning, we began to receive indications and warnings that Iran intended to attack U.S. bases in the region. That morning, building on the work that CENTCOM Commander Eric Carrillo had done, and on the orders of the President, at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and around the region, we assumed a minimum force posture.  Most folks had moved off the base to extend the security perimeter out away from what we assessed might be a target zone, except for a very few Army soldiers at Al Udeid.  At that point, only two Patriot batteries remained on base, roughly 44 American soldiers responsible for defending the entire base, to include CENTCOM's forward headquarters in the Middle East, an entire air base, and all the U.S. forces there.  The oldest soldier was a 28-year-old captain. The youngest was a 21-year-old private who'd been in the military for less than two years. So let's put ourselves out there for a second. Imagine you're that young first lieutenant. You're 25 or 26 years old, and you've been assigned as the tactical director inside the command and control element.  You, at that age, are the sole person responsible to defend this base. Listening next to you is your early warning operator whose job is to notify you of imminent attack. There's five people inside a vehicle and five people outside of a vehicle around these, a total of, as I said, 44.  By the way, you've sat in the Middle East for years, deployed over and over again, extended multiple times, always being prepared but unsure of when that particular day will come that you must execute your mission and not fail at doing it. In this case, these Patriot crews were deployed from Korea and Japan as part of our U.S. forces there.  to ensure that we had the most capable missiles in the CENTCOM area of responsibility.  As the day continues, you start to hear more and more chatter in the information space about an impending attack. And as the sun starts to set in the west, you get orders from your higher headquarters to make sure that your missile batteries are pointed to the north. There are just a few other teammates. It's hot, you're getting nervous, and you expect an attack.  Outside of those Patriot vehicles, your hot crew, which is one NCO and four additional soldiers, turns a key and relinquishes control of those missiles to that young lieutenant inside the vehicle, and you wait. You know that you're going to have approximately two minutes, 120 seconds to either succeed  or fail. And then at approximately 12.30 p.m. on Monday, that's 7.30 p.m. in Qatar, as the sun sets in the West, Iran attacks.  As the targets were detected, round after round of Patriot missiles are ejected from their canisters by an initial launch charge. Then the main solid rocket motor ignites. You can feel this in your body if you've ever been around a Patriot taking a shot. And round after round goes out and guides against those missiles coming inbound.  We believe that this is the largest single Patriot engagement in U.S. military history, and we were joined in this engagement by the Qatari Patriot crews.  I'm not going to tell you how many rounds were shot, but it was a bunch because of classified purposes. And we're aware that there's reports of something getting through. What we do know is there was a lot of metal flying around between attacking missiles being hit by Patriots, boosters from attacking missiles being hit by Patriots.  The Patriots themselves flying around and the debris from those Patriots hitting the ground, there was a lot of metal flying around. And yet our U.S. Air Defenders had only seconds to make complex decisions with strategic impact. These awesome humans, along with their Qatari brothers and sisters in arms,  stood between a salvo of Iranian missiles and the safety of value deed. They are the unsung heroes of the 21st century United States Army. And I know a lot of you have seen the videos online and the excitement as those patriots departed their launchers and went up and guided.  This really demonstrates the combat capability and capacity of our Army Air Defenders. Simply stated, they absolutely crushed it. If you'd flip this over, thanks. Let me next move to a walkthrough of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator weapon and share a little bit about the planners who did this and their work on the weapon.  First, let me set the stage for you. There's an organization in the US called the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA. DTRA does a lot of things for our nation, but DTRA is the world's leading expert on deeply buried underground targets. In 2009, a Defense Threat Reduction Agency officer was brought into a vault at an undisclosed location  and briefed on something going on in Iran. For security purposes, I'm not going to share his name. He was shown some photos and some highly classified intelligence of what looked like a major construction project in the mountains of Iran. He was tasked to study this facility, work with the intelligence community to understand it, and he was soon joined by an additional teammate.  For more than 15 years, this officer and his teammate lived and breathed this single target, Fordow, a critical element of Iran's covert nuclear weapons program. He studied the geology. He watched the Iranians dig it out. He watched the construction, the weather, the discard material, the geology, the construction materials.  where the materials came from. He looked at the vent shaft, the exhaust shaft, the electrical systems, the environmental control systems, every nook, every crater, every piece of equipment going in and every piece of equipment going out. They literally dreamed about this target at night when they slept. They thought about it driving back and forth to work.  And they knew from the very first days what this was for. You do not build a multi-layered underground bunker complex with centrifuges and other equipment in a mountain for any peaceful purpose.  They weren't able to discuss this with their family, their wives, their kids, their friends, but they just kept grinding it out. And along the way, they realized we did not have a weapon that could adequately strike and kill this target. So they began a journey to work with industry and other tacticians to develop the GBU-57. They tested it over and over again, tried different options, tried more after that.  They accomplished hundreds of test shots and dropped many full-scale weapons against extremely realistic targets for a single purpose, kill this target at the time and place of our nation's choosing.  And then, on a day in June of 2025, more than 15 years after they started their life's work, the phone rang and the President of the United States ordered the B-2 force that you've supported to go strike and kill this target. Yesterday, I had the incredible honor and privilege of spending time with these two Defense Threat Reduction Agency officers who've given so much. One of them said, quote, I can't even get my head around this. My heart is so filled  With the pride of being a part of this team, I am so honored to be a part of this. To you both, thank you, and thank you to your families. Operation Midnight Hammer was the culmination of those 15 years of incredible work, the air crews, the tanker crews, the weapons crews that built the weapons, the load crews that loaded it. Before I run through this video today, I want to talk a little bit about weaponeering and what goes into an attack.  Weaponeering is the science of evaluating a target. I mentioned all of those factors before that these two DTRA officers had thought about. Ultimately, weaponeering is determining the right weapon and fuse combination to achieve the desired effects and maximum destruction against a target.  In the case of Fordeaux, the DITRA team understood with a high degree of confidence the elements of the target required to kill its functions, and the weapons were designed, planned, and delivered to ensure that they achieved the effects in the mission space. By the way,  In the beginning of its development, we had so many PhDs working on the MOP program, doing modeling and simulation, that we were quietly and in a secret way the biggest users of supercomputer hours within the United States of America. So let me talk about  Let me talk about the graphic a little bit. And the GBU-57, which all of you I know know, is a 30,000-pound weapon dropped only by the B-2. It's comprised of steel, explosive, and a fuse programmed bespokely each weapon to achieve a particular effect  inside the target. Each weapon had a unique desired impact angle, arrival, final heading, and a fuse setting. The fuse is effectively what tells the bomb when to function. A longer delay in a fuse, the deeper the weapon will penetrate and drive into the target.  So on Fordow, in June of 2008, you can see these three holes. Depicted here is the main exhaust shaft with two additional ventilation shafts on either side. The United States decided to strike these two ventilation shafts, seen here on the main graphic, as the primary point of entry into the mission space. In the days preceding the attack against Fordow, the Iranians attempted to cover the shafts  with concrete to try to prevent an attack. I won't share the specific dimensions of the concrete cap, but you should know that we know what the dimensions of those concrete caps were. The planners had to account for this. They accounted for everything. The cap was forcibly removed by the first weapon, and the main shaft was uncovered.  Weapons 2, 3, 4, 5 were tasked to enter the main shaft, move down into the complex at greater than 1,000 feet per second, and explode in the mission space. Weapon number 6 was designed on each side. So there were six on each side. Weapons number 6 was designed as a flex weapon to allow us to cover if one of the preceding jets  or one of the preceding weapons did not work. The video I'm about to show you is a culmination of over 15 years of development and testing. As I said, hundreds of test shots on various models. This is one weapon. So if you take a view of this as five additionals, you'll get a sense of what this looks like.  Hopefully you can see it and there's not too much reflection. Tom runs our videos out there. We'll run it at full speed so you can see it and then go back through it. Go ahead, Tom.  Keep it going for a minute. You'll see inside the mission space.  Unlike a normal surface bomb, you won't see an impact crater because they're designed to deeply bury and then function. I know there's been a lot of questions about that. All six weapons at each vent at Fordow went exactly where they were intended to go. A bomb has three effects that causes damage, blast, fragmentation, and overpressure.  In this case, the primary kill mechanism in the mission space was a mix of overpressure and blast ripping through the open tunnels and destroying critical hardware. The majority of the damage we assessed based on our extensive modeling was a blast layer combined with the impulse extending from the shock. Imagine what this looks like six times over.  A point that I want to make here, the Joint Force does not do BDA. By design, we don't grade our own homework. The intelligence community does. But here's what we know following the attacks and the strikes on Fordow. First, that the weapons were built, tested, and loaded properly.  Two, the weapons were released on speed and on parameters. Three, the weapons all guided to their intended targets and to their intended aim points.  Four, the weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded. And we know this through other means, intelligence means that we have that we're visibly able to see them. And we know that the trailing jets saw the first weapons function and the pilots stated, quote, this was the brightest explosion that I've ever seen. It literally looked like daylight.  Let me now turn to the bomber crews themselves, give you a few details about them. The crews that attacked Fordeaux were from the active duty Air Force and the Missouri Air National Guard. The crews ranked from captain to colonel and most were graduates of the Air Force Weapons School headquartered at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. I will state for the record that there is no beach volleyball  or football at the Air Force Weapon School. They were male and female aviators on this mission, and a crew member told me when I talked to them on video the other day that this felt like the Super Bowl, the thousands of scientists, airmen, and maintainers all coming together. One last story about people.  When the crews went to work on Friday, they kissed their loved ones goodbye, not knowing when or if they'd be home. Late on Saturday night, their families became aware of what was happening. And on Sunday, when those jets returned from Whiteman, their families were there. Flags flying and tears flowing. I have chills literally talking about this.  The jets rejoined into a formation of four airplanes followed by a formation of three and came up overhead Whiteman proudly in the traffic pattern pitching out to land right over the base and landing to the incredible cheers of their families who sacrifice and serve right alongside their family members. Like I said, there were a lot of flags and a lot of tears.  One commander told me, this is a moment in the lives of our families that they will never forget. That, my friends, is what America's joint force does. We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we test, we evaluate every single day.  And when the call comes to deliver, we do so. I could not be more proud standing up here today of our joint force. I'm filled with gratitude that I get to tell their story. And as we stand here right now, our forces remain on a high state of readiness in the region, prepared to defend themselves. And one last thing. Our adversaries around the world should know that there are other  DITRA team members out there studying targets for the same amount of time, and we'll continue to do so. Thank you very much. I apologize for the length. I look forward to your questions."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1731.679, "text": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just thank you, by the way, for that extensive work, the lay down. I mean, even you have that laser pointer. Yes, sir.  Thank you, squaring me away as always. I mean, even in just the public reporting, if you see the post-strike shaft of the three holes, the vast majority, and fairly so, the vast majority of speculation has been those are the three strike points. When in actuality, what you realize is these are the vents, these are the caps, the first munition took the cap off, and the other five went down the center hole.  which, if you're planning the target, you would want it to be the direct one going to the bottom. These are the types of things that go into the planning for a strike that we wouldn't, the Pentagon would not expect the press corps, the American people, to initially understand, so laying this information out is helpful. But it's also why we asked for a beat.  for a moment, for a day or two, the opportunity to tell that story. Because as the chairman said, these men and women that did this mission, they just want to do their job. They're not expecting their story to be told. They're not expecting the glory. They are grateful for the flags and the hugs of family. That's why they do the job. But they also know they were a part of something historic.  We know how historic it was. The Chairman does. I know. Our staffs know. And so that's why we are \u2013 and the President of the United States knows. And that's why it's almost personal when we see the way in which leaks are used to try to disparage the outcome or muddy the waters about the impact of what happened without being responsible with information and allowing the professionals to assess and provide that information just like the Chairman did.  So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that information. And we welcome a few additional questions. Yes, sir. General, on Sunday you said final battle damage will take some time. And you also said, I think BDA is still pending, and it would be way too early.  for me to comment on what may or may not still be there at nuclear facility. That was just over three days ago. So what has changed? Would you use the term obliterated as well?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1863.949, "text": "Sir, like I said, we don't do BDA.

Sir, I think I said...  I mean, I think I explained what changed. There was a great deal of irresponsible reporting based on leaks, preliminary information in low confidence. Again, when someone leaks something, they do it with an agenda.  And when you leak a portion of an intelligence assessment, but just a little portion, just a little portion that makes it seem like maybe the strike wasn't effective, then you start a news cycle, whether it's the Washington Post or Fox News or CNN or MSNBC, you start a news cycle that starts to call into question the ethics. That's why.  So you bring the chairman here, who's not involved in politics. He didn't do politics. That's my lane to understand and translate and talk about those types of things. So I can use the word obliterated. He could use defeat, destroy, assess, all of those things. But ultimately, we're here to clarify what these weapons are capable of, which anyone with two eyes, some ears, and a brain can recognize that kind of firepower.  with that specificity at that location and others is going to have a devastating effect. So we all recognize there will be days and weeks ahead. That's why yesterday I said if you want to know what's going on in Florida.  You better go there and get a big shovel, because no one's under there right now. No one's under there able to assess, and everyone's using reflections of what they see. And that's why the Israelis, the Iranians, the IAEA, the UN, to a man and to a woman who recognize the capability of this weapons system are acknowledging how destructive it's been. So that's what's changed.  This is a point, this is how difficult it is to actually manage. You just watched a video of what this weapon is capable of. That's where we find our confidence is in the skill of men and women and the capability of the systems they employed and the recognition so far in the reflections that it was a highly successful mission."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1982.272, "text": " Sir, I think you could, I'd say go out.

I was reading from the CIA director's statement, which came out last night. CIA, again, they do the BDA, they do the assessment.  CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates, it also goes on to say, new intelligence from historically reliable and accurate sources and methods. Now, you can imagine, you can imagine the CIA director is going to be very careful about how he articulates things of that sensitivity. Classified, secret, top secret, compartmentalized, he's going to know things  You're not going to know. But the press isn't going to know. And he's reflecting that the sources he's seeing are highly credible. They've given credible intelligence. They or those processes have given credible intelligence in the past.

How about we take a beat, recognize first the success of our warriors, hold them up, tell their stories, celebrate that, wave an American flag, be proud of what we accomplished. And in the meantime, I can assure you, the chairman and his staff, the intelligence community, our staff and others are doing all the assessments necessary to make sure that mission was indeed successful. Yes, right there.  Sir, thank you. Mr. Secretary, Iran has recognized that their nuclear program was indeed severely damaged, but they also said that the U.S. strikes only strengthen their ability and their determination to complete their nuclear program. How do you respond to that, sir? Is that a provocation from Iran?  I would say Iran's going to have to say a lot of things right now in order to bolster their image, especially internally. You know, in the media, there's a lot of things they'll say for domestic consumption. But we're watching very closely what they do. Again, that's the intel community. Our job as the chairman \u2013 I mean, the chairman laid it out so beautifully. Our job is to be prepared.  And how proud are you? How proud am I? I didn't know the full story of those men and women 15 years ago who've been pointing at that target. That makes me proud to be an American. That's an awesome story. I hope we can tell more aspects of that in an unclassified way in the future. That's a great thing to know. Our job is to be prepared when the Commander-in-Chief calls based on those assessments. So, of course, our IC, the Intelligence Committee, will keep watching what Iran does and pay attention to that. But the President has created the contours, the opportunity  for a deal, for peace in something that the world said was intractable, that wasn't possible. And we got that peace, that ceasefire, that option because of strength, because of his willingness to use American military might that no one else on the planet can do with the kind of planners and operators that the chairman just laid out.  Yes, sir, right there, yep. Yes, sir? Just a quick question. There's public imagery available saying that highly enriched uranium was moved out of Fordow before the strikes. Is that accurate?
