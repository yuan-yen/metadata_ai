Sarah Eisen has the numbers. Hi, Sarah. Looks like they reported $0.14 per earnings per share. That was better than the $0.13. It was also beat on the top line a little better as well. $11.1 billion. The expectation was $10.7 billion. So some minor beats here. I'm going through some of the regions.  North America was better than expected, 4.7 billion, still a decline of 11% from a year ago. And then China was worse than expected at 1.4 billion versus the 1.5. Look, the story is not these numbers because Nike had warned that fourth quarter would be the low point when it comes to them trying to clear things out to get what they need, new innovations and new products on the shelves.  and to get going on CEO Elliott Hill's strategy. He's been in the job for eight months, and the real fireworks are going to come on the conference call when he lays out his strategy and any sort of timeline, if he is able to, to when we could see an inflection toward growth for this company. As far as what to listen for on the conference call,  Look, most of the analysts expect just quarterly guidance. They haven't been doing full year guidance because they are taking it quarter by quarter. But this is the end of the year for Nike, fourth quarter. So it'll be interesting what they say about order books into the holidays and what they're expecting for the next fiscal year. Another thing to watch out for, I'm hearing that Nike is doing a partnership with Amazon. And so that could be an interesting new approach, a new catalyst. Again, they're revisiting  how they have been doing business because they have been underperforming. As far as the comment from the press release here, financial results are in line with expectations, though they are not where we want them to be moving forward. We expect our business to improve as a result of the progress we're making through our win now actions.  One of the things they're doing, they're talking about a sport offense, just what I'm hearing that they could talk more about on the call. And that is a little bit of what they call a realignment of the business. So basically, Nike's been it's been organized by gender, men's and women's. And I'm told that they're going to be focusing more on organizing it by sport.  They want to get back to their knitting, the core business, basketball, running, where they have lost share and where they have lost some of the enthusiasm. So, not organizing by gender, but doing it by sport, which I'm told will not \u2014 is not a big sort of reorg that's going to result in any layoffs or anything like that. But it is going to be a complete rethink and sort of reorganization of the processes.  including things like innovation and marketing as well, where they have fallen behind. Just another way that Elliott Hill is now, that he's made some key hires, trying to turn things around. So we'll listen to that call. It starts at 5 p.m. But for now, a little bit better on what was expected to be a not great quarter. Stock has underperformed this year, Morgan. All right.

We're getting better from here.  Like Sarah was saying, they're going to have a conference call at five. I think they're going to talk a lot about the new product introductions, maybe some early reaction to those new products, how they're reestablishing these relationships with wholesale. Like I keep telling our clients, and I put out another report on Nike earlier this week, I don't expect anything to be all clear. There are challenges ahead, internal and external.

With President Trump as Commander-in-Chief, the world is a much safer place. After decades in which past Presidents coddled and enabled the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, President Trump finally ended the immediate threat of a nuclear Iranian regime.  Following President Trump's command, the most powerful military in the history of the world executed massive precision strikes on three of the Iranian regime's key nuclear facilities. The objective of Operation Midnight Hammer was to destroy the regime's nuclear enrichment capacity and stop the grave nuclear threat posed to the United States, Israel, and the rest of the free world. The mission, which will go down in the history books, was an overwhelming success.  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Rays and Kane covered the operation in great detail at their briefing this morning at the Pentagon, and I encourage every American to watch it. As President Trump has said repeatedly, the United States of America has the greatest, fiercest, and bravest armed forces ever to stride the face of this Earth, and we couldn't be more grateful and proud of our nation's warriors.  The Iranian regime was weeks away from being able to produce a nuclear weapon that would threaten the entire world before President Trump took this decisive action on Saturday night to obliterate their nuclear capabilities. The contrast in leadership could not be more clear. Barack Obama and Joe Biden sent pallets of cash, American taxpayer dollars, in a failed attempt to buy the Iranian regime's compliance with a weak and ineffective deal.  President Trump sent a fleet of American warplanes to destroy Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. The United States and the entire world are safer because of this President's decisiveness. Despite agenda-driven leaks by the fake news media aimed at undermining this incredible accomplishment achieved by President Trump and our brave fighter pilots, there is broad consensus emerging already that Iran's nuclear capabilities were, indeed, destroyed.  The United States, Israel, the United Nations, and even Iran all agree they can no longer build a nuclear weapon. So what did the President \u2014 why did the President immediately turn to obliterating after the Iranian nuclear threat? Securing peace. Within 48 hours of the devastating strike, President Trump and his team brokered a historic ceasefire between Israel and Iran and officially ended the 12-day war.  The Middle East is now shifting away from chaos and bloodshed and moving toward the beginning stages of a new era of peace and stability that President Trump has long called on them to achieve. This was unthinkable at this time last week, and this is what peace through strength looks like. Under President Trump, America will relentlessly advance our interests without being dragged into endless wars.  His fearless leadership guarantees America is once again respected across the world. Just look at what he was able to accomplish at the NATO Summit in the Netherlands. Many of you were there. Our allies agreed to invest 5 percent of their GDP annually in defense because President Trump demanded it. This will be the most significant reinforcement of NATO's collective defense in the history of the NATO Alliance.  And as a result, the United States of America will carry less of the burden, and our NATO allies will be stronger than ever before. As NATO Secretary General Ruda put it, for too long, one ally, the United States, and our taxpayers, I may add, carried too much of the burden of that commitment.  And that changes today. President Trump made this change possible. We will produce trillions more for our common defense to make us stronger and fairer by equalizing spending between America and our allies. This is the Trump effect. This is what the President meant when he declared that America is back.  Now back here at home, Americans are paying much cheaper prices for gasoline this summer as both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times pointed out today. Here's how the Wall Street Journal put it. Hitting the road this summer won't bring as much of a big hit to your wallet. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is about 23 cents cheaper than this time last year. Analysts say plentiful supply is expected to keep prices down in the coming months.  These are the cheapest gas prices at this point of the summer since 2021. And despite all the doom casting from liberal pundits, oil prices on Tuesday were lower than before the Israel-Iran conflict began. As President Trump continues to unleash American energy, our country will have even more efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to protect our national security and fuel our people.  Later this afternoon, here at the White House, the President will host a one-big-beautiful event in the East Room to rally Republicans to get the one-big-beautiful bill across the finish line. At that event, he will be joined by everyday Americans from across the country who will massively benefit from the common-sense policies and provisions within this bill. This is the largest tax cut for working and middle-class Americans in history, and it's going to put more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans.  Families will see an average increase in take-home pay of more than $10,000 per year. Americans earning between $30,000 and $80,000 per year will see a 15 percent tax cut. Overtime and tipped workers will save thousands of dollars annually. And our amazing seniors will receive historic financial relief by reducing the tax burden on their Social Security benefits.  Simply put, this bill is going to unlock the golden age of America. And we look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to see this bill on the President's desk for signature by Independence Day.

The President and his team, namely Special Envoy Whitkoff, continue to be in communication with the Iranians and especially our Gulf and Arab partners in the region to come to an agreement with Iran.  As for our alliance with the State of Israel and that friendship and that partnership between the United States and the State of Israel, I would argue it has never been stronger. And we see a new era in which perhaps some of these Gulf and Arab states can sign on to the Abraham Accords. That was one of the President's most signature accomplishments in his first term, and he'd like to see more of those countries sign on in this second term.

Is there enough time for Congress to work through the issues it needs to work through? I'm saying, does the President need to move back his deadline a little bit?  We expect that bill to be on the president's desk for signature by July 4th. I know that there was a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian this morning. Look, this is part of the process. This is part of the inner workings of the United States Senate. But the president is adamant about seeing this bill on his desk here at the White House by Independence Day.  Is there a date set for the Prime Minister to visit the White House yet? Is he coming in a couple weeks? There isn't a date, but the Prime Minister has expressed interest in coming to the White House to meet with the President and come to Washington. The President is obviously very open to that, but we don't have a date when we do. We'll let you all know. Kate.  The President suggested he was open to sending more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine. Is that going to happen? And were there any other assurances that he made directly to Zelensky when they met? I'll let the President speak on that. That was a private conversation between he and President Zelensky. But the meeting was a good meeting, and it was a meeting towards progress. And the President, as he said, repeatedly wants to see this war come to an end. But I'll let him speak on that specific point.  And Whitkoff yesterday suggested that there would be more countries signing on to the Abraham Accords. What's the timeline on that, and which countries specifically is the administration looking to have signed on? Well, the president is certainly hopeful that more countries in the region will sign on to the Abraham Accords again. We want to see a long,  withstanding endurable peace in the Middle East, and that's the way to do it. And when the president met with the new president of Syria, that was one of the requests that he made for Syria to sign on to the Abraham Accords. I don't have a timeline for you, but this administration wants to see that happen, and our partners in the region should know that. Rachel. Thanks so much. Just to follow back up on the meeting that the president mentioned about wanting to have this meeting with the Iranians next week, clearly there's a willingness here from the administration to want to meet with Iranian officials.  What is the holdup here in trying to schedule it? Are you experiencing any resistance from the Iranians? No, have some patience. We just had this strike on Saturday night. The president secured a ceasefire. A lot has happened in the last week. He was just in the Netherlands. Now he's back home to have a big event this afternoon on the one big beautiful bill and get our domestic priorities across the finish line. So we'll get there. And like I said, we're in constant communication.  One more, just on the goal of the meeting. The President mentioned yesterday that it may not be necessary to have an agreement with the Iranians.

Well, I can assure you what the CIA director said, that when we look at the entirety of the intelligence that we have to this date, it concludes that these strikes on Iranians, the Iranian nuclear facilities, were absolutely successful. It was a total obliteration, as the president said. And not only does our own intelligence say that, but also the Iranian foreign minister has said that. We saw Israel conclude the same thing based on their own intelligence. We also had the United Nations say that as well.  I think the only other time the United Nations, Israel, Iran, and the United States has agreed on something is that the sky is blue. But they all agree that Iran's nuclear facilities were completely demolished. And I would just like to reemphasize, you mentioned this was a low-confidence preliminary intelligence assessment. And the entirety of that assessment was not leaked to the media. Only tidbits of that assessment  were  bits and pieces of an intel assessment to push a false narrative. And it's to the same reporter, I will add, Natasha Bertrand of CNN, who has done this in the past. In 2020, it was Natasha Bertrand who had 51 intelligence analysts falsely lie to her, but she still put it on paper for some reason, that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation.  We all know that's not true, right? We can all agree on that now. That was a lie from the intelligence community. Also in 2020, this same reporter, Natasha Bertrand, wrote that a top intel agency ruled out the man-made lab leak theory of the coronavirus origins. Again, the president was right about that.  Reporter wrote a lie from the intelligence community to seek a narrative she wanted to prove. And guess what? We now know that's the truth. Also, in 2024, Bertrand pushed the suckers and losers hoax. She also pushed the fine people hoax, which was taking the president's words purposely.  out of context. And then last October, and I believe this is notable, Natasha Bertrand published an article in Politico from the intelligence agency. She said that John Ratcliffe was speaking without any evidence when he said Iran was attempting to undermine President Trump's presidential campaign.  And then we, of course, found out that was absolutely true. In fact, the Biden administration declassed an Intel report which said they had high confidence that Iran had done exactly what Ratcliffe alleged. They did run an influence campaign to hurt President Trump's candidacy. In fact, we know the Iranians tried to take President Trump's life.  And so this is a reporter who has been, unfortunately, used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government to push fake and false narratives. She should be ashamed of herself. And that's not what reporting is. Journalism is trying to find the facts and the truth. And this week, we saw this same reporter being used to push a fake narrative to try to undermine the president of the United States and, more importantly, the brave fighter pilots who conducted one of the most successful operations in United States history. And I think the American people fully know  that this operation was a complete and total success. Elizabeth. Thank you, Caroline. The Miami Herald recently published a story saying the Trump administration was targeting migrant foster children. The Trump administration has denounced this as false. Could you clarify the Trump administration's position on protecting migrant children, particularly the 300,000 lost under the Biden administration?  Yes, I saw that Miami Herald article yesterday, and I was aghast at the headline. It's egregious to accuse this administration of trying to target foster children. That is not at all what is happening at the Department of Homeland Security. And I learned that the Department of Homeland Security actually tried to work in good faith with this reporter to get this story right, to explain that this administration is trying to protect foster children. We are trying to keep children out of harm's way.  Even if that means their parents are not law-abiding citizens, we want to protect children, unlike the previous administration, which allowed children to be trafficked and raped, and in some cases killed, because of the open border policies. Unfortunately, the Miami Herald just  completely degraded themselves with this report, despite having a full list of facts from the Department of Homeland Security. It's another example of fake news. And the May border numbers speak for themselves. Not a single illegal alien was allowed into this country because of this administration's border policies in the month of May. That means not a single child was allowed into this country, possibly with human smugglers or human traffickers. And we know that was happening at the rate of thousands and thousands of children every single month.  in the previous administration for four years, and you didn't see any reporting of that from the Miami Herald. But now they're trying to accuse this administration, and we tried to give them the facts, and they refused to report them. So thank you for bringing that report to light. Ayesha. Good to see you again. You too. I know you're looking for this. You're usually on the Hill. I know. I'm here today. I know you're looking for this leaker. Is it your belief, I know you said earlier you're not sure if it's on Capitol Hill or at the Pentagon, but is it your belief that it might be at  In Capitol Hill and how confident are you that you'll find this leaker? Well, I'm not personally looking for the leaker The FBI is looking for the leaker So you'll have to ask them in the Department of Justice in in terms of this investigation But you know leaking top-secret classified Intelligence is is a crime and people need to be held accountable for that crime  just ask you about how you're going to be limiting intel to Congress. What would you say to lawmakers who say they have oversight privileges, they need this information? This administration wants to ensure that classified intelligence is not ending up in irresponsible hands and that people who have the privilege  of viewing this top-secret classified information are being responsible with it. And unfortunately, clearly, someone who had their hands on this \u2014 and it was a very few people, a very few number of people in our government who saw this report \u2014 that person was irresponsible with it. And we need to get to the bottom of it, and we need to strengthen that process to protect our national security and protect the American public.  Mary Margaret, go ahead. Thank you, Caroline. Sure. You just laid out a lot of different stories about disinformation that Natasha, excuse me, that Natasha Batran had pushed during her time at Politico and at CNN. Why would any member of the Trump administration leak anything to her? Well, again, as I just said, we're investigating who that leaker was. It could have been someone in the intelligence community or it could have been someone on Capitol Hill who had access to this document. We are, the FBI is searching for that person.

So the House is ready to receive this bill back from the Senate so they can pass it and bring it to the president's desk. So it was a great meeting. And Republicans are very unified. And we also talked about the mayoral race in New York City.  and how the victory of the Democratic primary candidate really shows how far left and unhinged the Democrat Party has become.

Thanks, Caroline. The Supreme Court ruled this morning that South Carolina is allowed to deem Planned Parenthood as not a qualified health care provider, and that will block it from receiving Medicaid funds. Does the White House have a statement on that ruling? And would the President support a standalone bill from Congress to defund Planned Parenthood at a federal level, rather than let each state determine it? I'll let the President speak.  on that legislative priority. But as for the Supreme Court ruling, the president has always maintained that Americans should not be forced to violate their conscience and their religious liberty by having their tax dollars fund abortions. And we're glad the Supreme Court ruled on that side today, or yesterday. And then on Iran, but on a domestic matter, in January, President Trump revoked security details for several former administrations, including  Mike Pompeo, Mark Milley, and Joel Bolton. Given the heightened tensions with Iran right now, is he considering restoring those security details? That's not under consideration right now. Fran. If I could follow up on trade, and then I have a question about the bill as well. Are you saying at this point that there's no plans to extend that July 8th and July 9th deadline? I mean, especially with everything that's been going on from Iran to the tax bill on Capitol Hill, is that under consideration at all at this point?  Perhaps it could be extended, but that's a decision for the president to make. And as far as the bill itself goes, since the president has been back, what has he been doing beyond the event that he's having later today to try and get wobbly senators on board? Is he making phone calls, twisting arms? Is he having some people over to the White House? Can you tell us more about that? There have been meetings at the White House this week. I saw some senators rolling out of the Oval Office the other day. And the president remains on the phones talking to his friends in the Senate when necessary. And when they call, he picks up the phone.  And I think that's why they greatly trust and respect his leadership. And we're having that big event later this afternoon at 4 o'clock. I would encourage you all to tune in. We're going to have some great everyday Americans who are in attendance. We'll have some tipped delivery drivers. I think we're going to have a barber from the great state of Arkansas here in attendance. We're going to have some law enforcement officers, some Border Patrol agents, and Tom Homan will be speaking as well. So the point of this event is to show the American people how this bill works for them and how there are provisions in this bill that will  changed their lives. I'll let the President speak on that if he wishes. I don't share details about his private meetings without his permission. Emily, go ahead.  Federal law bars hiring somebody based on their race or sex, but do you also object to universities working harder to make sure they have a diverse group of candidates to consider, and do you expect more investigations like this from DOJ? I have not seen that investigation from the Department of Justice, but I can certainly check in. What I can tell you, it's the position  of this president, that we want to restore a merit-based society and culture in the United States of America, where people are not hired nor are they promoted based on their color of their skin or their gender. The president wants people to be hired in the workforce because of their merit and their skill, and I think most Americans agree with that. I'll take one more. Carrie, because I promised you earlier.  So the Ayatollah Khomeini came out and said that Iran will, quote, never surrender to the U.S. That being said, what remains to do with the possible responses from Iranian proxies in the region and even in the U.S. ?  We saw the Ayatollah's video, and when you have a totalitarian regime, you have to save face. I think any common-sense, open-minded person knows the truth about the precision strikes on Saturday night. They were wildly successful. And it's what led to the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, which the president is very grateful for.  And the United States of America remains prepared to defend our assets and our personnel in the region. And again, I would just emphasize the success of the strike that took place on Saturday night. And the world is a safer place because of it. Thanks, guys, for coming today. And you'll see the President at 4 o'clock.

I want to follow up on that story that Lisa was just reporting. Do we have a deal in the energy space or not? Again, Wall Street Journal was reporting that Shell  early stages and talks to acquire British Petroleum BP, then Shell say, no, not so much. So I don't know where we are here, but let's check in with Will Harris. It's his job to know what's going on. He's a senior global energy analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. He's based in London.

It's pretty consistent with what we think. This would be a very opportunistic and potentially quite risky strategic departure for Shell. They have shown a very strict capital discipline for the last several years. And so this would be a big, big ticket item for them to try and absorb.  any deal would likely near $100 billion, assuming something like a 20% premium. And you would almost certainly see major antitrust hurdles, integration risks, synergy challenges over many, many years, which would follow. So in short, we think it's quite unlikely that Shell would make a run at the full takeover of BP.  What we do think is probably more likely is they could be interested in selected businesses of BP that they could add as sort of bolt-on acquisitions."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 115.812, "text": "Had this played out, of course, it would have been a really major deal here.

We're mostly seeing smaller.  lower risk near field acquisitions from these companies. They're not taking the kind of big risks that we have seen maybe in the last couple of decades. And that's for many reasons. I mean, these portfolios are much more global and much more diverse than they have been in the past. And there's this tension at the moment within this peer group  of how much to focus on their core oil and gas hydrocarbon portfolios and how quickly to advance their energy transition ambitions, what percentage of their CAPEX should they be investing in renewable power, hydrogen, EV charging networks, knowing that these are much lower return businesses than their core oil and gas projects."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 187.934, "text": " All right, I'm putting on my M&A banker hat, Will, here, because I want to get a deal on the tape here. I want some bankers and lawyers to get paid here. BP's got a market cap of $80 billion. That's a big number. That's a lot of money. But Shell's at $200 billion and ExxonMobil's at $470 billion.

And the answer is not really. So BP has suffered terribly on valuation compared to Shell and particularly compared to their American counterparts, Exxon and Chevron. This is for many reasons. They've had a flip-flopping strategy over the pace of their energy transition progress. Their costs have been far too high. Their spending has been far too high.  They, for a couple years, they were planning to reduce their hydrocarbon production by a significant amount. They've turned that around. So they've sort of been all over the place. Their valuation has suffered, which makes them a potentially interesting acquisition target. We've written for a while now that the sum of their parts is much more than where they're currently valued. Their balance sheet is also quite over leveraged. So this makes them an attractive  But as we know, there are very, very limited suitors out there. Exxon, Chevron, Shell, potentially some Middle Eastern NOCs.

There's a very wide strategic divergence across the Atlantic. Exxon and Chevron have stayed the course with oil and gas for the most part. They are still investing heavily in oil and gas growth, particularly in the Permian and also down in Guyana with some major projects coming online now and in the near future.  And you can compare that to the European strategies, which have moved quite quickly into renewable power, solar, offshore wind, hydrogen. And I think the proof is in the pudding as far as how the markets have received these. You can see Exxon and Chevron are currently trading at about 30% higher on a forward earnings basis than the European group. So the market has certainly told them what they think.  The issue with the Europeans is that they've been pulled in two different directions. They have their traditional energy investors and they also have a growing cadre of sustainability-minded investors that are demanding a quicker reduction in carbon intensity and a quicker pacing of their energy transition investments."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 381.48, "text": " Well, I've watched the first season of Landman.

And so it was sort of seen as a heavy carbon profile, was seen as a major, major risk to these companies. But in reality, oil and gas investors want oil and gas exposure.

I think it's important to note that this tie-up has been rumored to happen for longer than I've been alive, and it hasn't. And I think one of the big reasons for that is the antitrust issue. And so this particularly applies for the fuel retail marketing component of these companies.  where you could potentially see the majority or even all of the fuel supply of certain countries being dominated by one company. Countries will not like that. So I think this is probably the number one reason why it hasn't happened so far. I continue to think it's the reason why it won't happen, but I would not be surprised, Shell, to be interested in something like  BP's onshore US shale business, which is called BPX, maybe their Gulf of Mexico portfolio, which is where there'd be huge operational overlap and potential cost synergies, offshore Brazil in the deep water, and particularly BP's LNG business, which is about half of what Shells is,  But combining those, it would be controlling roughly a quarter of the global LNG market.

There's a whole lot of pressure in this industry, and that pressure's coming from the payers, the PBMs.  the insurance companies. And so it's an interesting time because I think we've probably reached the bottom where there's no more blood to be kind of squeezed from the stone from pharmacies. And we're seeing new reimbursement models come about, what they call like cost plus, like Mark Cuban's model, cost plus drugs, where the PBMs are actually forcing this on the pharmacies as a payment model. And so it's interesting in that Walgreens is probably selling at the bottom, but it might be, you know, a little brighter in the future from here."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 754.029, "text": " So as we're looking at the pharmaceutical space or the pharmacy space more broadly here, you've got Walgreens, you've got CVS, but you also have, you know, right into all these other companies, but they lean a lot into the retail space.

So people aren't buying things in the same way that they used to for a convenience factor.

There's no one price. Like if you go and buy, I don't know, a toy from Walmart, it's the same no matter where you go. And it's usually probably within spinning distance if he goes to a competitor. Drug prices are just all over the place.  And so one of the reasons the PBMs come under such fire is they're the ones kind of controlling that system of pricing and making it not transparent.

I think those are going to stay. I think we'll see, I think we'll still see retail pharmacies because people still need to go around the corner and get something when they get, I don't know, a sinus infection or something like that.

All right, Micron Technologies reported earnings here today, a semiconductor company. I don't know a lot about this company, so I said let's get somebody smart in here to talk to us about it. Jake Silverman, he's the one we got. Semiconductor analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. He joins us here in our Bloomberg Interactive Brokerage Studio. Talk to us about Micron Technology. What did they report and what's it tell you about the semi-space?  Yeah, so they had pretty strong results last night. It was a beaten raise, very strong on earnings based on strong gross margins.  The bit growth was really what drove the strength in the quarter. And pricing was relatively weak based on mix, but generally in the right upward trajectory. And really, the way to think about memory is it's pretty ubiquitous across electronics. You can think about smartphones, PCs, servers, both traditional and AI.  You know, everything that you have that's in your pocket, on your desk, sitting somewhere in your house, it's going to have memory or storage, some combination of the two potentially as well."}, {"keywords": ["Apple", "Trade", "Tariffs", "Export", "Import"], "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1107.392, "text": " So we all know that demand for AI computing is really high right now. We're seeing a lot of those companies capitalizing on it, and Wall Street really keeping a high bar for these companies. But how is Micron matching up with all the other companies? Where are they in line?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 37, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1121.535, "text": "Yeah, so generally speaking, it's important to keep in mind that Micron and a lot of the memory peers really trade on a cyclical basis.  quite a few inventory buildups, and then companies do restocking. And in the past, there wasn't really as much of an AI story for Micron specifically, but with high bandwidth memory of some of their other products, you can think about high capacity solid state drives and high capacity DRAM modules. That has all been an AI story for the most part, and we've seen a lot of tailwinds in that business.  Micron continues to gain share, execute very well. It was a pretty important part of their story for this past quarter and heading into the end of this fiscal year. I said at the beginning, I didn't know a lot about Micron Technologies. No surprise, the stock's up 50% year to date. What's the story there?  Yeah, so there were definitely a lot of worries once we got into this sort of tariff-related potential headwinds in April. And that really was a major drag on the stock price, because there was potential for higher prices across all of their product lines. And that could really be a hindrance to demand for a lot of consumer-related specifically products, like PCs, smartphones, USB drives. And so as that kind of  you know, headwind kind of faded away. What's happened is Micron has gotten those tailwinds from AI and better pricing. And so there's just a couple of different factors that have actually been really helping them out. They've continued to generate solid free cash flow over the next, over the last several quarters. And the expectation is for that to continue. That's very important in an industry that's very cyclical."}, {"keywords": ["Apple", "Trade", "Tariffs", "Export", "Import"], "line": 38, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1226.296, "text": " So it said on the conference call that analysts were really asking the CEO questions about HBM. They're trying to get a sense of how much growth is coming. Can you explain what that is for our listeners?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 39, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1237.462, "text": "Yeah, so high bandwidth memory, HBM, it's a very important part of AI servers. It's attached pretty much directly to the GPUs that NVIDIA sells that end up in these big server stacks. And so high bandwidth memory has been an area where Micron has been gaining share  SK hynix was the incumbent and micron has been executing very well on their roadmap. First on eight high as you'll hear in the call, right, but also 12 high as well. So eight high is for Blackwell and the 12 high is for Blackwell ultra GB 300 that's coming out. So that procurement cycle has already kicked in and they're going to see a pretty strong demand over the next coming months and quarters for, uh, for their 12 high stack products. And it's really all AI related.  Demand for HBM, it's AI. So that takes us back to the big, big picture. And I know you and your technology research colleagues at Bloomberg Intelligence, you do a ton of work on AI. You've got what I think is the definitive report on AI. So folks, if you haven't seen it, go to the Bloomberg BI Go, and that's the definitive report on Wall Street, I think, on AI.  We never talk about ADA more because it's tariffs all day, every day. Just give us the latest on the AI story. Investors you talk to, the clients you talk to, are they still as bullish on AI as they were, say, last year? Yeah, I think there's a lot of optimism still in AI. For Micron specifically, it's been, you know, we've been talking about NVIDIA kind of beating and raising for so many quarters and maybe a little bit of a slowdown last quarter or so. But Micron, the story was so early.  They still like a very small percentage of their revenue is AI related. So it's kind of interesting how there's been a little bit of a dichotomy in terms of AI not being the same tailwind for Micron that you'd see for some other companies like Nvidia. But there's still a lot of optimism in the investor community and there's quite a few people trying to understand where does Micron really benefit from AI and how much more infrastructure expansion  for AI, hyperscale CapEx, how does that benefit Micron? How much more do we need to see for Micron to really benefit heavily from that? All right, Jake, thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.

But at the end of it, we were left with no more information on how effective the strikes were than we had started with. And in fact, General Kane even emphasized that that assessment would not come from the Pentagon, but rather from the intelligence community.  Now, outside of the briefing this morning, we have heard additional information from other important voices, including the head of the International Atomic Energy Organization, IAEA, that highlighted that from their perspective, there's reasonable understanding that the sensitive equipment at Fordow is most likely incredibly damaged.  And that, in and of itself, leans in the direction of, obviously, the president's comments that there is a lot of impact from these strikes.

In addition, the questions remaining on the 400 kilograms of highly enriched uranium likely wouldn't be solved even if inspectors were able to return, if they weren't able to enter the sites. So we are left with very big questions about where that concerning amount of highly enriched uranium is. We talked last time about the fact that this  This enriched uranium could be easily transported in the back of 10 sedans.

It's something that is being, I think, sort of pressured against by what I call a loud minority of voices at the cross purposes of the impact to the wider community of people across the United States and the globe.

And your actions need to have positive effects on those three things for them to be valid, right? So that is where telling,  a brand that they should pull back from anything related to DEI doesn't make sense on any of those three levers, especially the third when we think about commercial impact. That's what companies exist for. So right now, what companies should be doing is making rational decisions based on what it looks like to be responsible in their environment, to their customers, to their employees, to their stakeholders, to their communities.

And those businesses, because they're... You could have done that.  they're strong through various cycles, right? All of a sudden have greater value. So now what we're seeing in our shop is a tick up of deal flow, which means more realization. So stay tuned, Paul, it's coming. The headlines is private credit is trying to find a new valuation and maybe private equity too. You mentioned there's $3 trillion looking to exit out there in some way, somehow.  go through the process right now about somebody, an endowment or whoever has to clear, they have to sell private credit. How does that occur on a less heated Thursday in June? Yeah, so what they're doing now is they're coming to us and they're saying, Randy, you know, you guys have a really successful platform. There's certain strategies we really like about your business.  we have these other businesses that we want to get out of. Okay, can you help us to move our portfolio from strategies that we thought were going to work out but over the last several years has not been as resilient as we thought or the returns haven't been there. So we sit down on a consulting basis with these firms and we say we can help you get into a, let's call it a more resilient area with better returns and lower risk. What's the haircut everyone wants to know?  How much haircut are people taking? Well, it depends on the risk asset class that they are currently in, right? So if they're in a distress class and they're not getting the volume, which by the way, historically has been the case because where's the recession? Everybody's saying, hey, the great thing about private credit is, you know, you've done really well, but there hasn't been a real recession.  which is true. You know, there have been little crises, as one of my friends at Moody's says, there have been quizzes, not tests."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 42, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1157.329, "text": "Okay."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 43, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1158.15, "text": "But you know what? Some of the asset classes have failed the quizzes, right? If you fail a quiz, you're still failing. So I do think that what we're seeing now from our survey and what we're seeing in our pipeline  So, April was kind of a low month, given tariffs and everything else. May was a bit of a comeback. June, we have seen 50% higher deal flow than we saw June of last year. So, I think this $3 trillion, Tom, that you mentioned  globally of corporates waiting to exit, that ice cube is starting to melt. We're seeing it in our pipeline. We're seeing it in global M&A data. The folks at London Stock Exchange keep track of this. M&A for 2025 through the middle of June is up, you know, over 22 and 23. So I do think that it's coming back.  Where are the banks here as you and your private credit folks look at deals? Where are the banks these days? Because you guys focus on middle market and where are the banks? Yeah. So great segue. So kudos to Carmen Arroya and Ellen Schneider, your reporters who came out yesterday. I guess it was Tuesday. Headline JP Morgan traders shut out of private  credit market. Okay, what's going on there is they're going out with their list, you know, I worked there, you worked there, right? You know, remember they go out with lists, hey, we'd like to buy these loans, and here's a bunch of loans, okay? Or we want to sell those loans, here's the list. And what your reporters basically said, which is really true, is that, you know, nobody wants to sell these loans. If I have a  300, I have 300 loans, 300 companies in my senior portfolio and they're doing well. Why would I want to sell them? So while JP is obviously a giant in terms of secondary trading and loans and bonds, everything else in the private markets, it's more challenging because these things are illiquid. And one of the people that they quote says, it's like making an ostrich fly. It doesn't happen. Do you care? Just one final question quickly. Do you care about mark to market?

Well, they have to prove two different crimes in order for him to be convicted of RICO. Drugs. Transportation of drugs across state lines. We've heard individuals say that they did that for him. Kidnapping. There were three different instances of kidnapping. Arson. That would be Kid Cudi's car, which was blown up with a Molotov cocktail, which prosecutors claim Diddy was behind that. But think about it this way.  If the jury has to find him only guilty on two of those predicate crimes, it could be just two examples of trafficking drugs. That's it. And then the jury could convict him on RICO."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 136.094, "text": "All right.

Good to see all of you. With President Trump as Commander-in-Chief, the world is a much safer place. After decades in which past Presidents coddled and enabled the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, President Trump finally ended the immediate threat of a nuclear Iranian regime.  Following President Trump's command, the most powerful military in the history of the world executed massive precision strikes on three of the Iranian regime's key nuclear facilities. The objective of Operation Midnight Hammer was to destroy the regime's nuclear enrichment capacity and stop the grave nuclear threat posed to the United States, Israel, and the rest of the free world. The mission, which will go down in the history books, was an overwhelming success.  Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Rays and Kane covered the operation in great detail at their briefing this morning at the Pentagon, and I encourage every American to watch it. As President Trump has said repeatedly, the United States of America has the greatest, fiercest, and bravest armed forces ever to stride the face of this Earth, and we couldn't be more grateful and proud of our nation's warriors.  The Iranian regime was weeks away from being able to produce a nuclear weapon that would threaten the entire world before President Trump took this decisive action on Saturday night to obliterate their nuclear capabilities. The contrast in leadership could not be more clear. Barack Obama and Joe Biden sent pallets of cash, American taxpayer dollars, in a failed attempt to buy the Iranian regime's compliance with a weak and ineffective deal.  President Trump sent a fleet of American warplanes to destroy Iran's ability to produce a nuclear weapon. The United States and the entire world are safer because of this President's decisiveness. Despite agenda-driven leaks by the fake news media aimed at undermining this incredible accomplishment achieved by President Trump and our brave fighter pilots, there is broad consensus emerging already that Iran's nuclear capabilities were, indeed, destroyed.  The United States, Israel, the United Nations, and even Iran all agree they can no longer build a nuclear weapon. So why did the President immediately turn to obliterating after the Iranian nuclear threat? Securing peace. Within 48 hours of the devastating strike, President Trump and his team brokered a historic ceasefire between Israel and Iran and officially ended the 12-day war.  The Middle East is now shifting away from chaos and bloodshed and moving toward the beginning stages of a new era of peace and stability that President Trump has long called on them to achieve. This was unthinkable at this time last week, and this is what peace through strength looks like. Under President Trump, America will relentlessly advance our interests without being dragged into endless wars.  His fearless leadership guarantees America is once again respected across the world. Just look at what he was able to accomplish at the NATO summit in the Netherlands. Many of you were there. Our allies agreed to invest 5 percent of their GDP annually in defense because President Trump demanded it.  This will be the most significant reinforcement of NATO's collective defense in the history of the NATO alliance. And as a result, the United States of America will carry less of the burden, and our NATO allies will be stronger than ever before. As NATO Secretary-General Ruda put it, for too long, one ally, the United States, and our taxpayers, I may add, carried too much of the burden of that commitment.  And that changes today. President Trump made this change possible. We will produce trillions more for our common defense to make us stronger and fairer by equalizing spending between America and our allies. This is the Trump effect. This is what the President meant when he declared that America is back.  Now back here at home, Americans are paying much cheaper prices for gasoline this summer as both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times pointed out today. Here's how the Wall Street Journal put it. Hitting the road this summer won't bring as much of a big hit to your wallet. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline is about 23 cents cheaper than this time last year. Analysts say plentiful supply is expected to keep prices down in the coming months.  These are the cheapest gas prices at this point of the summer since 2021. And despite all the doom casting from liberal pundits, oil prices on Tuesday were lower than before the Israel-Iran conflict began. As President Trump continues to unleash American energy, our country will have even more efficient, reliable, and affordable energy to protect our national security and fuel our people.  Later this afternoon here at the White House, the President will host a One Big Beautiful event in the East Room to rally Republicans to get the One Big Beautiful bill across the finish line. At that event, he will be joined by everyday Americans from across the country who will massively benefit from the common-sense policies and provisions within this bill. This is the largest tax cut for working and middle-class Americans in history, and it's going to put more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans.  Families will see an average increase in take-home pay of more than $10,000 per year. Americans earning between $30,000 and $80,000 per year will see a 15 percent tax cut. Overtime and tipped workers will save thousands of dollars annually. And our amazing seniors will receive historic financial relief by reducing the tax burden on their Social Security benefits.  Simply put, this bill is going to unlock the age, the golden age of America. And we look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to see this bill on the President's desk for signature by Independence Day.

Is there a date set for the Prime Minister to visit the White House yet? Is he coming in a couple weeks? There isn't a date, but the Prime Minister has expressed interest in coming to the White House to meet with the President and come to Washington. The President is obviously very open to that, but we don't have a date when we do. We'll let you all know. Kate.  The President suggested he was open to sending more Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine. Is that going to happen? And were there any other assurances that he made directly to Zelensky when they met? I'll let the President speak on that. That was a private conversation between he and President Zelensky. But the meeting was a good meeting, and it was a meeting towards progress. And the President, as he said, repeatedly wants to see this war come to an end. But I'll let him speak on that specific.  And Whitkoff yesterday suggested that there would be more countries signing on to the Abraham Accords. Is there \u2013 what's the timeline on that, and which countries specifically is the administration looking to have signed on? Well, the President is certainly hopeful that more countries in the region will sign on to the Abraham Accords. Again, we want to see a long  withstanding endurable peace in the Middle East, and that's the way to do it. And when the President met with the new President of Syria, that was one of the requests that he made for Syria to sign on to the Abraham Accords. I don't have a timeline for you, but this administration wants to see that happen, and our partners in the region should know that. Rachel. Thanks so much. Just to follow back up on the meeting that the President mentioned about wanting to have this meeting with the Iranians next week, clearly there's a willingness here from the administration to want to meet with Iranian officials.  What is the holdup here in trying to schedule it? Are you experiencing any resistance from the Iranians? No. Have some patience. We just had this strike on Saturday night. The President secured a ceasefire. A lot has happened in the last week. He was just in the Netherlands. Now he's back home to have a big event this afternoon on the one big, beautiful bill and get our domestic priorities across the finish line. So we'll get there. And like I said, we're in constant communication. And just one more, just on the goal of the meeting.

Well, I can assure you what the CIA director said, that when we look at the entirety of the intelligence that we have to this date, it concludes that these strikes on Iranians, the Iranian nuclear facilities, were absolutely successful. It was a total obliteration, as the President said. And not only does our own intelligence say that, but also the Iranian foreign minister has said that. We saw Israel conclude the same thing based on their own intelligence. We also had the United Nations say that as well.  I think the only other time the United Nations, Israel, Iran, and the United States has agreed on something is that the sky is blue, but they all agree that Iran's nuclear facilities were completely demolished. And I would just like to reemphasize, you mentioned this was a low-confidence preliminary intelligence assessment, and the entirety of that assessment was not leaked to the media. Only tidbits of that assessment were leaked to CNN. And we have seen this playbook run before.  where you have people in the intelligence community or perhaps on Capitol Hill, we don't know, but I believe the FBI is investigating to find out who that leaker was because it's illegal, and they should be held accountable for that, leaked bits and pieces of an intel assessment to push a false narrative. And it's to the same reporter, I will add, Natasha Bertrand of CNN, who has done this in the past. In 2020, it was Natasha Bertrand  who had 51 intelligence analysts falsely lie to her, but she still put it on paper for some reason, that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation. We all know that's not true, right? We can all agree on that now. That was a lie from the intelligence community. Also in 2020, this same reporter, Natasha Bertrand, wrote that a top Intel agency ruled out the man-made lab leak theory of the coronavirus origins. Again, the president was right about that.  This reporter wrote a lie from the intelligence community to seek a narrative she wanted to prove. And guess what? We now know that's the truth. Also in 2024, Bertrand pushed the suckers and losers hoax. She also pushed the fine people hoax, which was taking the president's words purposely out of context. And then last October, and I believe this is notable, Natasha Bertrand published an article in Politico from the intelligence agency. She said that John Ratcliffe was speaking without any evidence  when he said Iran was attempting to undermine President Trump's presidential campaign. And then we, of course, found out that was absolutely true. In fact, the Biden administration declassed an intel report which said they had high confidence that Iran had done exactly what Ratcliffe alleged. They did run an influence campaign to hurt President Trump's candidacy. In fact, we know the Iranians tried to take President Trump's life.  And so this is a reporter who has been, unfortunately, used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government to push fake and false narratives. She should be ashamed of herself. And that's not what reporting is. Journalism is trying to find the facts and the truth. And this week, we saw this same reporter being used to push a fake narrative to try to undermine the President of the United States and, more importantly, the brave fighter pilots who conducted one of the most successful operations in United States history. And I think the American people fully know  that this operation was a complete and total success. Elizabeth. Thank you, Caroline. The Miami Herald recently published a story saying the Trump administration was targeting migrant foster children. The Trump administration has denounced this as false. Could you clarify the Trump administration's position on protecting migrant children, particularly the 300,000 lost under the Biden administration?  Yes, I saw that Miami Herald article yesterday, and I was aghast at the headline. It's egregious to accuse this administration of trying to target foster children. That is not at all what is happening at the Department of Homeland Security. And I learned that the Department of Homeland Security actually tried to work in good faith with this reporter to get this story right, to explain that this administration is trying to protect foster children. We are trying to keep children out of harm's way.  Even if that means their parents are not law-abiding citizens, we want to protect children, unlike the previous administration, which allowed children to be trafficked and raped, and in some cases killed, because of the open border policies. Unfortunately, the Miami Herald just completely degraded themselves with this report, despite having a full list of facts from the Department of Homeland Security. It's another example of fake news.  And the May border numbers speak for themselves. Not a single illegal alien was allowed into this country because of this administration's border policies in the month of May. That means not a single child was allowed into this country, possibly with human smugglers or human traffickers. And we know that was happening at the rate of thousands and thousands of children every single month.  in the previous administration for four years. And you didn't see any reporting of that from the Miami Herald. But now they're trying to accuse this administration. And we tried to give them the facts, and they refused to report them.

What intelligence is that based upon? Look, the President shared that statement with all of you, and I already answered the question about whether uranium was moved prior to the strike, and the answer is no.

You've been emphatic about the President's expectations for the one big, beautiful bill to hit that July 4th deadline. You had a big meeting on Capitol Hill yesterday with the Republican Study Committee. Did you walk away from that meeting pleased with what you heard?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 36, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1586.864, "text": "Did it bolster your confidence that Congress is able to meet the expectation of the President?  Yes, I did. The camaraderie at the Republican Study Committee was great. Members expressed their feelings about the bill. But as we saw, the bill passed through the House, despite many people believing it could not. So the House is ready to receive this bill back from the Senate so they can pass it and bring it to the president's desk. So it was a great meeting. And Republicans are very unified. And we also talked about the mayoral race in New York City.  and how the victory of the Democratic primary candidate really shows how far left and unhinged the Democrat Party has become. And Republicans truly are on the right side of every issue in this country. We are on the side of no men and women's sports, on the side of low taxes, secure borders. So that was the topic of discussion. And the unity was strong and the camaraderie was high. And I know everyone looks forward to being here at the White House for the bill signing next week.  Sure. Thanks, Caroline. The Supreme Court ruled this morning that South Carolina is allowed to deem Planned Parenthood as not a qualified health care provider, and that will block it from receiving Medicaid funds. Does the White House have a statement on that ruling? And would the President support a standalone bill from Congress to defund Planned Parenthood at a federal level, rather than let each state determine it? I'll let the President speak.  on that legislative priority. But as for the Supreme Court ruling, the President has always maintained that Americans should not be forced to violate their conscience and their religious liberty by having their tax dollars fund abortions. And we're glad the Supreme Court ruled on that side today, or yesterday. And then on Iran, but on a domestic matter, in January, President Trump revoked security details for several former administrations, including Mike Pompeo, Mark Milley, and Joel Bolton.  Given the heightened tensions with Iran right now, is he considering restoring those security details? That's not under consideration right now. Fran. If I could follow up on trade, and then I have a question about the bill as well. Are you saying at this point that there's no plans to extend that July 8th and July 9th deadline? I mean, especially with everything that's been going on from Iran to the tax bill on Capitol Hill, is that under consideration at all at this point? Perhaps it could be extended, but that's a decision for the President to make.  And as far as the bill itself goes, since the President has been back, what has he been doing beyond the event that he's having later today to try and get wobbly senators on board? Is he making phone calls, twisting arms? Is he having some people over to the White House? Can you tell us more about that? There have been meetings at the White House this week. I saw some senators rolling out of the Oval Office the other day. And the President remains on the phones, talking to his friends in the Senate when necessary. And when they call, he picks up the phone. And I think that's why they greatly trust and respect his leadership.  And we're having that big event later this afternoon at 4 o'clock. I would encourage you all to tune in. We're going to have some great everyday Americans who are in attendance. We'll have some tipped delivery drivers. I think we're going to have a barber from the great state of Arkansas here in attendance. We're going to have some law enforcement officers, some Border Patrol agents, and Tom Homan will be speaking as well. So the point of this event is to show the American people how this bill works for them and how there are provisions in this bill that will change their lives.  I don't share details about his private meetings without his permission.  federal law bars hiring somebody based on their race or sex but do you also object to universities working harder to make sure they have a diverse group of candidates to consider and do you expect more investigations like this from DOJ? I have not seen that investigation from the Department of Justice but I can certainly check in. What I can tell you it's the position  of this President, that we want to restore a merit-based society and culture in the United States of America, where people are not hired nor are they promoted based on their color of their skin or their gender. The President wants people to be hired in the workforce because of their merit and their skill, and I think most Americans agree with that. I'll take one more.

My siblings and I were little and we shared all we had. I wasn't born into power and privilege, I was born into struggle. Always knew what struggle was.  If you're going to be a man of people who are going through a lot, you must be a human being that has gone through a lot. We experienced a lot of pain as a child. I rose through the ranks and became a captain. I worked every day to protect the city, the city that I love.  Let us serve in the state Senate, then as Brooklyn Borough President. I didn't chase fame. I chased solutions.  Whether it was fighting food insecurity or improving housing, or lifting up broken families, something that I continue to do. When I became mayor, it was clear to me that what we were facing and how we had to turn it around. And one of the most important partnerships that I developed were the partnerships I developed with our faith-based leaders. They knew something that I knew.  prayer rose. Yeah, many, many would look down on it and don't see the connection between prayer and government. I'm afraid of the mayor that don't appreciate prayer and the power of our faith-based leaders. And so when we look at all the things we were facing, ask yourself, what have we achieved?  Let's talk about what we've done over the last few years. We brought down crime. The last six months have been the lowest number of shootings and homicides in the history of the city. And what does that mean for those of you who are here? Think about it for a moment.  are the victims of shooting. Who are the victims of those who are shooting? So when we took 20,000 guns up our streets, we took it out of the hands of black and brown people, and we prevented the loss of lives of black and brown people. This impacts you. It impacts those of you who are here right now.  We made smarter choices in the police department and more accountable. Gun arrests are record high. Removals of guns are record high. And what do we do with our economy? 500,000 new jobs to this administration. More jobs in New York and the city's history, folks. Techie boom. Tourism is back.  Broadway had the best 12 months in recorded history. Construction is growing. And yes, Times Square is alive again. And what about our housing comeback? We've approved and launched more affordable housing in a single year in the history of the city of New York. We're going to break that record again.  We're turning unused buildings into homes, and streamlining permitted and rezoned areas of growth. And you cannot have this conversation without talking about mental health. We made the decision to take people from living up the street because there was nothing dignified by having a checklist of tents and people living on the street. We knew that we had to remove from the plight of our city and give people the opportunity they deserve.  So when I'm here today, I say to you, we expanded treatment, not just about for long term, for short term, but for long term. Mental illness has been treated like a police problem for far too long. We changed that dynamic on the streets and in our subway system. We have done more for education than any mayor in our city, 130,000 pre-K.  over 100,000 summer youth jobs 110,000 and rise up put our children on the pathway to careers and employment dyslexia screening so 30% of our population won't sit in jail because they believe they're dumb instead of knowing that they learn differently we have changed the trajectory of our children from what they eat to how they think teaching them meditation breathing exercises mind for me so they can deal with the  the young person, so social media so I can stop indoctrinated in her and her and our Children. So I want to be clear as I make this re election. Yeah, what I'm fighting for. They come into office with the personal agenda. I came with the personal mission. Fight for  and do double and triple jobs like my mother did. I fight for the restaurant workers in the Bronx, for the teachers in Queens, for the bougainvillea owner in Brooklyn. That's why we gave them a panic button so they could stop being arrested and stop being assaulted and robbed. I fight for a Niger grandmother in Harlem watching over her grandchildren. That's why we made sure we had a Niger  high speed broadband so that children can have remote learning and they can have telemedicine. I fight for everyday New Yorkers who just want their city to done work for them. And that's what we're doing. And I fight for small property owners. You have individuals who are running for mayor  who was saying no rent. Those small property owners were losing their homes, and many of them were black and brown. Their entire wealth was tied up into their small property owners. And we hurt them. And now we are saying everything is going up around them, heating costs.  Con Edison, insurance. And we're not willing to give them a small 1% increase in their rent so they can keep up. If we lose them, we lose the middle class in our city. And I fight for them. So I'm not interested in Twitter politics. I'm interested in getting the trash picked up.  I'm not interested in slogans. I'm interested in solutions. I don't work for special interests. I work for the people. I'm proud of the incredible team that we have built.  First Deputy Mayor Mastro has brought a new dynamic into the city. My Chief of Staff Camille Joseph Bollock has handled crisis out of crisis in an amenable way. Jessica Tish and her vision in the New York City Police Department has started with my first commissioner that I appointed and is continuing to today. And the over 300,000 city workers that I gave a fair contract to so they won't be afraid to give it a pay for the food that they need to place on their table.  We build a government that works with urgency, compassion, and accountability. And guess what? Phones haven't stopped ringing. People have been calling to say, we want to help, Eric. We want you to continue to do what you do. How can we join Team Adams? The excitement has filled the air. You're going to see a movement that you've never witnessed before. And I told all of you in the beginning,  This was going to be the most interesting political campaign in the history of the city. It didn't stop on June 24. It started on June 24, and it will keep going until November 4. For the record, the record that stands are those in the noise.  I know politics. Politics, you know, is loud. All you got to do is yell that noise in the park. We know that. Social media is loud. But let's look at the facts.  There are some critics who spend more time attacking than achieving. Let me be clear. They have a record of tweets. I have a record on these tweets. Record of results. They talk about problems, I fix them. That's the difference.  You don't leave this city from a soapbox. You leave it from the ground up with action, not rhetoric. And one thing we do, we deliver and we never quit.  I'm there front and center leading from the front.  everything from a yarmulke to a kubri to a hijab, to a turban, to a headscarf. It's all part of our diversity and the clothing is representative of what we stand for as a city.

Why am I running for re-election? Because we got more to do. We got more to do. Can you imagine  I'll move forward with what this city is going to look like. We laid the foundations around this time to build the future.  My second term, I'm going to continue to bring down crime. Launch a citywide mental health initiative to advance workforce development and vocational education. Expand housing faster than ever before to add on our race success. Deliver cleaner streets and better city services. Make the city the greenest city in America, and bring Guelph Academy into new era inclusive growth.  So here's my closing message to you. Believe in us. I believe in our grit, our soul, our resiliency. I believe that our best days are still ahead. Let's build a city where every kid can dream and every senior can feel safe and every person can thrive. Let's not go backwards.  Let's move forward together. So four more years mean a lot. It gives me the time to finish the job. And this election is a real choice. This election is a choice between a candidate with a blue collar and one with a suit and silver spoon.  The choice between dirty fingernails and manicure. The choice between someone who delivered lower crime, the most jobs in history, the most new housing built in decades, and an assembly member who did not pass a bill. It's a choice. It's a choice between real progress and empty promises. A future for broken people, not a fantasy state.  The selection of choice between those who believe in the city and those who don't. Let me tell you something. This is a city out of socialism. I've been to socialist countries.  This is a city where you can come as a dishwasher and you can own the chain of restaurants. This is a city where you can be a cab driver and then become a doctor. This is a city where you can go from homelessness to building houses. This is a city where you can be a young person who's dyslexic, a young person who is rejected, and eventually to be elected to be the mayor of the city of New York. This is the type of city we're in.  This is not a city where you use idealism to state you're giving everything to everyone for free. There's no dignity in someone giving you everything for free. There's dignity in giving you a job so you can provide for your family and the opportunities that you deserve. So this is not a city of handouts.

I'm going to go in there and get the brief from the secretary from the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, what I'm really, really hoping is that this is not a repeat of almost the identical classified briefing we got after President Trump killed Soleimani. Another bold action against Iran that was needed. This terrorist killed  and wounded thousands of our troops in the briefing five years ago with Secretary Pompeo, our military leaders under President Trump.  Trump won. The Democrats spent the entire briefing criticizing the administration, asking, did you have evidence that Soleimani was going to kill American troops in Iraq? Are you kidding me? Soleimani been killing troops for years. And did you have the authorization to kill this number one terrorist in the world? So I'm really, really hopeful  that my Democrat colleagues make this about the evidence, and maybe thanking President Trump for taking this bold action, which is what every president since George W. Bush has said we had to do to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, and not making this all about what AOC, the leader of the Democratic Party in Congress, wants, impeachment of the president,  right? So this is a really important issue. It's gonna be a real indication of where the Democrats are. Are they serious? Or is this gonna be badgering? You know, Marco Rubio, Pete Hicks, General Kane. Did they have evidence? Did they have authority? I'd like to hear a thank you and  How bad was the damage? This is about this is, you know, you say you want to hear them say thank you, but this is a briefing for senators to ask questions. What are the things that you need to pull out of that to be satisfied with your constituents that yes, this is handled properly and that we acted what they're saying? So one thing that I don't think it's gotten enough attention right now. Yesterday, the Israeli ambassador briefed us at lunch, okay?  So taking out the Iranian nuclear capacity has a lot to do with taking out the facilities, but it's also a lot to do with taking out the personnel. The scientists, the generals, how much is that degraded? How many of them were killed?  And also, as the ambassador mentioned yesterday, the archives where they've done all their research. There's a whole host of facilities that aren't directly related to the exact bombing of this one that have a lot to do with the capacity to create and deliver a nuclear bomb. So those are the kind of questions I'm going to be asking.  This shouldn't be what it was with General Suleimani. General Suleimani's briefing was one of the more embarrassing things I've seen as a U.S. Senator. Every Democrat was going after Secretary Pompeo, saying, you didn't have the authority, you didn't have the evidence, and it was ridiculous. Suleimani deserved to be dead, and the world is a better place.  safer place when President Trump ordered him to be killed. And now the world's a better, safer place now. Iran's nuclear capacity has been dramatically degraded. We'll see by how much. But this idea of kind of prosecuting these guys, as opposed to thanking them, I think is ridiculous, and I'm hoping it's not going to happen again. Senator, there was a report that the Trump administration wants to brief senators less.

Member from Georgia is recognized for five minutes.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to speak in favor of my bill, the Special Interest Alien Reporting Act of 2025, an essential piece of border security transparency legislation. A special interest alien, or SIA, is a non-U.S. person who, based on a DHS analysis of travel patterns, may pose a national security risk to the United States or its interests.  My bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to publicly release monthly reports on the number of special interest aliens encountered at our borders, their countries of origin, and where they were encountered. This bill would be retroactive to January 20, 2021.  so that we can get a better sense of the catastrophic national security impacts of the Biden-Harris administration's open border policies. And I would like to say that's likely why Democrats are fighting this bill so hard. DHS publicly reports detailed information on encounters and seizures  including CBP encounters of individuals on the terrorist screening data set, better known as the terrorist watch list, which is an even more targeted and specific number than the number of SIAs. But missing from the DHS reporting is information on SIA encounters,  Instead, Congress and the American people have been left only with random, incomplete announcements periodically released by DHS officials or through leaks to the media. Similar to the information released on the terrorist screening data set,  My bill would require DHS to report general and counter information on special interest aliens and would not include any personal identifiable information. No matter how many times my Democrat colleagues say it, there is no personal information released.  In fact, senior DHS officials, like the former Border Patrol chief, have occasionally put out some of these numbers on social media and elsewhere. Public reporting of SIAs will increase the transparency and accountability that are critical to the health of our constitutional republic. Congress has the authority and responsibility to provide transparency to the American people  which is exactly what my bill does, and I would argue the American people pay our paychecks, so they deserve to know the truth. The Biden-Harris administration's disastrous policies place the United States in an extremely vulnerable national security position. Under Biden and Harris, our sovereign borders became revolving doors for illegal aliens, including an untold number of murderers, rapists, and potential terrorists  who hate our country and want to cause harm to our people. Over the past four years, CBP faced an unprecedented number of special interest aliens from the 26 countries that the Department of Homeland Security has determined pose the greatest national security and counterintelligence threat.  These encounters included individuals from adversarial nations, including the People's Republic of China, Iran, Afghanistan, and Syria. The Biden-Harris administration's intentional disregard for our laws and breakdown of national security resulted in U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountering over 1.7 million  special interest aliens. Many of these individuals were swiftly processed and released into the interior under the Biden-Harris administration's catch-and-release policies. The American people deserve to know who our government is encountering at the border and where they came from while they are attempting to invade our country illegally.  Given the ongoing events in the Middle East, this legislation is essential for Congress to conduct congressional oversight over special interest aliens encountered invading our borders. During the Biden-Harris administration, the Border Patrol apprehended over 1,500 Iranian nationals illegally crossing the southwest border between ports of entry.  Of those, Biden and Harris admitted 729, almost half. And we don't know where they are now, and we don't know what they may do.  With Iran threatening Americans with retaliatory strikes on our homeland, President Biden and Borders are Kamala Harris created an opportunity for our adversaries to gain access to our nation and wreak havoc when called upon. I'm proud that the Trump administration supports this important piece of legislation. And I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to please support to increase in transparency and account accountability within our government. Thank you. And I yield back."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

This is incredibly unusual for the DOJ of the United States to sue every federal judge in a given state, in this case, the state of Maryland. It all stems back to immigration and the DOJ view that Maryland federal judges are putting up roadblocks for deportations. Since coming back to office in January, President Trump signed a flurry of executive orders, many of them making their way to courtrooms across the country, but a large amount ended up in Maryland courts. The DOJ, writing in its lawsuit in recent months and years,  District courts have used and abused their equitable powers to interfere with the prerogatives of the executive branch to an unprecedented degree. DOJ argues the judiciary cannot hamstring the executive branch from carrying out legitimate executive orders, especially when it comes to immigration. Critics of the lawsuit note the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government. Alicia Bannon, who works with the Brennan Center of Justice, wrote on social media, it's hard not to see this challenge as further escalation by the administration of its opposition to courts that have sought to  check illegal government conduct. The ironic part, though, Bill and Dana, the lawsuit was filed in Maryland, so the judges, who are the defendants here, may end up deciding the case if they don't send it elsewhere. An unusual one.

The Supreme Court today ruling 6-3 in favor of South Carolina, one of these Republican-led states that has attempted to exclude Medicaid patients from getting care at Planned Parenthood.  This case all came down to, does Planned Parenthood and Patients, do they have the right to challenge this under a provision of federal civil rights law? In this majority decision, which was authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump's first appointee to the court, he said that they cannot move forward in this lawsuit under this civil rights law. Justice Gorsuch writing at length here in this opinion, saying that the civil rights law can only be invoked in very rare circumstances.  and that these laws, they actually have to unambiguously give these plaintiffs the right to bring these kinds of cases. And he looked to the Medicaid Act and said he just didn't see it here in this statute. So the bottom line, this is going to most immediately pave the way for South Carolina to keep excluding Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program.

So because of that, you know, we saw the plaintiffs trying to argue that that was not legal, that that did not follow the Medicaid Act and that was illegal. The Supreme Court's decision doesn't even get into that because they said that they have no right to sue in the first place under that civil rights statute, that they didn't need to address it. So it does seem at this point that there may not be any legal pathways left for people to bring these challenges. So the Supreme Court not explicitly saying what South Carolina is doing here is legal,  But really, the practical effect here is this really paves the way for states across the country, if they so choose, to exclude Planned Parenthood or any other providers that they don't want to include in state Medicaid plans.

The spotlight today is on a name that has hit a 52-week high today. It is Coupang, CPNG. Yeah, so we were talking about the dollar before. One of the bull markets that's taking place right now that not a lot of people are that excited about, at least not yet, is emerging market stocks. They're really starting to go. The IEMG is having a great year outperforming the S&P. Within the IEMG,  Korean stocks are the fourth largest country allocation. The KOSPI is on fire, up 28%. Korea's 25.50 index, which is a little bit growthier, is up 42%. And almost nobody knows this or is paying any attention.  Coupang is on the best stocks in the market list because it's a Korean business, but it's incorporated and based in Seattle. So this is a U.S. company with a U.S. founder, but most of their business is being the Amazon of South Korea. The best comp here is MercadoLibre, Melly.  Mellie is up 9,000% plus since its IPO. This company is probably five years behind Mellie in terms of its margins, its earnings, its growth. So there's still a lot of opportunity. It came public in 21. Everybody forgot about it because the whole growth stock market crashed for a year.  But now it's working its way back. And the reality is that it's not terribly expensive. It's in a 40% drawdown from that 21 high. Barclays has a $36 target. And it's a best stock. It's breaking out. You've got a 50 to 200 day moving average crossover, which signals short term momentum. And I think the stock probably gets itself into the mid 30s at a minimum based on the breakout that we've seen. So Coupang is  A name that not a lot of people know of in the United States, but it should be on people's radar. It is on our radar now.

So people are comfortable owning them for the medium term even if there's some rockiness or slowdown in the economic environment.  On the other hand there's a lot of other stuff that's a little bit weaker and it's a reason why in our portfolios we've continued to favor large cap over small and mid cap which I think even in an environment where the Fed cuts twice in 2025 the growth trajectory that we were on  pre-tariff announcements would suggest a more challenging environment for these companies. And we know that they are located in different parts of the supply chain. They tend to have less pricing power. They're less geographically diverse. They're more dependent on bank lending than long-term funding at the large cap. So there's lots of reasons. So I'd say there's a mix on fundamentals.

Just for perspective, the pending sales index is hovering just above the lowest level in 24 years. It's only a tiny bit higher than it was in April 2020, that one month plunge during the pandemic shutdown. And that was just one month. It shot way back up following that.  We've been around this current level since December. Now, the tiny monthly gain since last month came despite rising mortgage rates during the month and was likely due to more than 31% more homes for sale than there were at this time last year. Now, the read on sales of newly built homes, which we got yesterday, was much worse, even though builders also have an historically high level of supply. But that's because new homes are more expensive than comparable existing ones, and the builders just don't build entry-level homes anymore.  In addition, the cost of homeownership is rising. Nearly a quarter of all homeowners are considered cost burdened, spending more than 30% of their income on housing and utilities. And that is according to the new latest annual report from Harvard's Joint Center for Housing.  It cites home prices up 60% since 2019, insurance premiums up 57%, and even more in high climate risk areas, and property taxes up 12%.

Now some people do develop acute pancreatitis, this is a very sudden onset, very sharp, and about 5% of people will sadly die.  Many others, they just need oxygen and fluids and they will recover on their own.

And it's now that it's gone into wider use that they're really beginning to bottom out those figures. They do stand up. So this is something that we're looking for. And it's possible that these are having an impact on the pancreas that you don't want to happen.  And that's why the MHRA, the medical regulator, is collaborating with another part of the NHS called Genomics England. And they're the ones that do an awful lot of the genetic testing. So they're looking at the genes of people who are developing this huge issue while on these weight loss drugs to see if they do have genes that make it more likely they will develop this issue. And that might mean that some people in future might be told that maybe  you shouldn't take these drugs or maybe you should try a different drug if there's a difference between Minjaro and Wagovi for example or indeed some of the new ones which are coming down the track. So they're trying to shape the prescribing to account for this risk because they know the benefits of taking them for some people are extremely strong but they do want to reduce any potential risk that they can."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 597.472, "text": " So in light of this data from the MHRA, what is the advice from the regulator itself, from the drugs manufacturers, from the GPs and of course from Professor Thomas Moore himself?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 609.442, "text": " On all of those, it would be to stick to the reason that these drugs have been licensed, that they have been shown to be beneficial and safe in people with high obesity. We're not talking just a few pounds overweight, we're talking about people who are living with obesity, who have tried other ways of losing weight and have failed. They are transformational in those situations. They lead to very rapid weight loss of about 15 to 20% of body weight within a matter of months.  with all the health benefits that come with that. For people with type 2 diabetes it reduces the blood sugar levels and indeed independent of all that there is research showing that it not only reduces the risk of heart disease, cardiovascular disease by 20% but it also reduces deaths from cardiovascular disease by 20%.

People do want to look their best and to a certain degree we do live in that world where  Celebrities want to be their slimmest possible selves on the red carpet. We all want what they want. And that's the way that these drugs have wormed their way into society. And of course the easy access of these medications from some online pharmacies where they're not doing the kind of  good checks that should be done before people prescribe these drugs, then you can see how access is there and people are seizing it.

It's good to catch up with you. I want to start with this data, and maybe we can spend some time on the palace intrigue later on. Jobless claims, initial claims lower than expected, continuing claims higher than expected, and creeping higher over the past few months.

Now, continuing claims are going up because it takes a little longer to find a job. That's consistent with the hiring numbers just being slower as the economy comes to a more sustainable pace.

When will you have enough data to really make that determination?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 77.47, "text": " Well, one of the challenges of central banking that you just have to accept is that we never have perfect data, so you're always making judgments, and you want sufficient data to make a judgment that is really going to be best for the American people. So right now, we have incoming information on the labor market, which does not signal real weakness, it just signals slowing, so we'll continue to watch that.  And then on inflation, the data have been good so far coming in. If we were only backward-looking, we would say, oh, it's time to adjust the interest rate. But we have to be forward-looking. And then you have to make judgments about how you think inflation will shape up going forward. And there I really see three scenarios. And I'm leaning towards one that I'll tell you more and more.  The one scenario, of course, is that it's just delayed. The tariffs are going to have some impact on inflation. It is, after all, an increase in costs, and that will be a more persistent effect. The second opportunity or possibility is that it's delayed, but it will be a one-off.  And then the third, of course, which I think is increasingly possible, it's not my modal, but it's increasingly possible, is that this just doesn't amount to as much as the models in history would tell us because businesses find ways to absorb the costs and they split it down the production chain and ultimately consumers pay less of that.  So I think those last two scenarios, it's delayed but it's a one-off or it doesn't materialize to the extent that the models would suggest, those are where I'm putting increasing probabilities and we'll just have to collect some more information to make a decision. But ultimately, we can't wait for perfect information or we'll be behind and we can't do that to the American people."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 173.36, "text": " It sounds like, President Daley, you're leaning toward a sooner rate cut if it is confirmed that this tariff impulse isn't as inflationary as people expected.

I mean, my modal outlook has been for some time that we would begin to be able to adjust the rates in the fall. And I haven't really changed that view. It does seem like that. Of course, if the tariffs are one-off, you can look through them. And if they're just not going to materialize, then you have to watch both sides of the mandate.  And I think that's really important. It's not one or the other. It's both sides of our mandate that have really come into frame since we brought inflation down from the really high levels to something that's closer to our target. Ultimately, we have to watch both sides, and that's what I'm doing. And then the fall looks promising for a rate cut.  I don't know for sure. I mean, we have to be open about what we don't know. Humble is, I think, the word that comes out of the inflation run-up. And so, but we will, you know, there's a lot of differences of views on the committee. I see that as a real positive right now because people bring their perspectives and the data will guide us to what is the one that ultimately looks like reality."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 239.253, "text": " President Daley, John was talking about the palace intrigue, and I do wonder about how the increasingly political overlay to the Fed has complicated your messaging, given that there is this debate about the dual mandate, etc. How much has it affected the way that you communicate?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 255.288, "text": " You know, not really. One of the things that I recognize on a regular basis is if I go out and talk to the people who live in the 12th Federal Reserve District, so that's nine states, very diverse states in the West, they don't actually bring this up at all. What they bring up is,  What do you think is going to happen to inflation? Will you be able to restore inflation to 2%? Will you be able to restore price stability? Do you think the labor market is going to be preserved during it? Because ultimately I really want both jobs and lower inflation. I want to be able to get ahead. And so far,  The people in my district are cautiously optimistic overall, thinking that the economy is weathering some of the worst concerns and the uncertainties, but continuing to move along. So cautiously optimistic is where they are, and I think that reflects what's on top of their mind, less about what's happening in Washington and more about what's happening in their lived experience in their communities."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 309.97, "text": " So, President Daley, would you dismiss some of the discussions around shadow Fed and all of that as simply palace intrigue and not necessarily affecting what would happen on the Fed?

And there's a sense where people really want us to get that down. Inflation is a tax on people, and every time we let people continue paying that tax, it erodes their well-being. So I'm very focused on getting inflation down to 2%. Us being sure that we're on that sustainable path, as long as the labor market doesn't show signs of weakening, is really important.  You have to make a view, you have to have a view about what you think tariffs will do to inflation. Now my own view is that they will potentially raise inflation, that's my modal outlook, but they should dissipate over the period. It's not going to be something that builds into inflation expectations and thus we really have to lean against it. But we can't just be assuming we know just because that's our modal outlook. We have to really collect the information and understand.  Data dependence isn't a backward-looking activity. It's a forward-looking activity. Right now, we're looking forward by talking to our contacts, and they still feel uncertain about what they will do. They're going to try to pass some along, but they, as a number of people you've had on your show have mentioned, firms don't have all those abilities, whether they're managing their brand or just they have exhausted consumers who can't take anymore. That's what we're waiting to find out.  But I don't think we're behind in our waiting. We've got policy in a good place. The economy's in a good place.

There's many things that affect yields. We make policy that we believe will  be with the lags in monetary policy, supportive of both of our goals.

It was the first airline to go under during COVID, got snapped up by an American private equity giant, landed an investment from Qatar Airways, and this week made its comeback on the ASX as Middle East turmoil whipsawed markets. So what is next for Australia's second biggest airline?  Hello, I'm Rebecca Jones and welcome to the Bloomberg Australia podcast. Today, we dive into the Virgin Australia IPO, the biggest listing on the ASX so far this year. Well, it is technically a relisting if we're being precise.  To examine what its return means for investors, consumers, and the airline industry, I'm joined by Angus Whitley, Global Business Reporter for Bloomberg News, who writes about aviation and has spoken this week to the company's new CEO. Angus joins me today from Sydney.  Angus, I'm going to try and lay off the flying puns and I will commit to that, but just let me sneak in one more. The last five years have been pretty turbulent for Virgin Australia. Can you give us a potted history of what's happened since the dark days of 2020?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 97.645, "text": " The dark days of 2020 really were the start of the pandemic, weren't they? Virgin Australia did not last long when the pandemic grounded global aviation. It was saddled with debt, and once it couldn't fly anywhere, it really couldn't service the debt, so it was paralyzed.  Virgin went under. Attempts to seek government help failed. And if you remember, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, at the time, lobbied against that. So it was cutthroat. It was cutthroat stuff. There were layoffs. Since then, Virgin Australia has gone through three different CEOs. They've undertook years of planning for the IPO through their majority owner, Bain Capital, at the time. There was at least one false start, one failed attempt to list when the listing window closed.  And now we're here. So now they're stringing together consecutive profits. They recorded the first profit in 11 years, would you believe, in 2023. So this was not a company that made money on any regular basis before. And now they're set to record three annual profits in a row. So they've come a long way since those, as you say, dark days of 2020. And it's a pretty different airline."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 171.814, "text": " Of course, shares have just started trading on the Australian Stock Exchange on Tuesday afternoon.

And the stock closed at $3.23, so that was an 11% pop on the first day, which, you know, that's pretty good. That tells us that Bain left something on the table, as they say.  for the new investors. But also, I think it's a remarkable result, really, when you think of how they managed to thread this needle and get the IPO away, given all the developments, the fluidity, the fast-moving developments in the Middle East that was really, you know, affecting global sentiment. Doesn't matter whether you're an Australian airline or an Australian company. The IPO  was hours after Iran's retaliatory strikes in Qatar and hours, just hours after the ceasefire, Trump's announced ceasefire between Israel and Iran. So if they'd started trading a few hours earlier, it would have been a different story, but things really did fall for them. That's why they got an 11% pop."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 247.695, "text": " And we're recording this on Wednesday and of course things are still quite volatile and we could be in a different situation, right, when this episode comes out on Thursday. I am interested, Angus, in the word on the street. Is it supporting this narrative, Bain being the smartest kids on the block here, right? Are the analysts telling you that the IPO valuation is about right or do they think it's overvalued?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 276.166, "text": " Yeah, good point. I mean, you're buying an asset off a private equity company. You know, there's lots of pitfalls there. They know the asset better than anyone. And if you're a new investor coming, you don't know anything about the asset, really. All you know is the prospectus. It's a bit like buying a secondhand car. You might have the service record, you'll have the price, and you'll know the owner, you have a prospectus.  in the sense of an IPO, but you don't really know too much about the inner workings of the company. So that's what puts people off buying assets from private equity, because they've stripped out costs, which Bain has in the case of Virgin Australia, and it's a good time for them to sell. Does that make it a good time to buy? That's questionable. However, the Australian analyst community is largely full of bulls.  If you look at the analyst ratings for Qantas, for example, there's only one seller, and that's Morningstar. And that's partly because it's a duopoly. Qantas and Virgin largely share the entire market. If you can't make money in a duopoly, you know, you're doing something wrong.  So was the IPO valued? I think the trade on the first day tells us something. The spoils were probably evenly spread between Bain and EU investors. I mean, Bain raised more than 600 million Australian dollars. The investors made more than 10% return in a day.  It's too early to say what the market thinks of Virgin Australia stock now. We've only got one analyst rating on the terminal, and that's from CLSA. They have an accumulate rating, but the stock is already above CLSA's target price. So time will tell, but it's very early days. But from the first day's performance, I think both Bain and the new investors were pretty happy."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 388.615, "text": " I want to talk about oil prices because oil prices and the aviation industry, they're inextricably linked. We've seen those prices tumble this week as tensions have appeared to ease in the Middle East. But as I said before, it's still a very volatile situation over there and these sorts of crises can hit the global demand for travel.  Not to mention Virgin's significant ties to the Gulf region via its Qatar Airways stake and long-haul flights to Doha, etc. What did the new CEO, new-ish CEO, Dave Emerson of Virgin Australia have to tell you about that when you spoke to him?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 427.562, "text": " Dave Emerson is the new CEO and actually this was his first outing with media on Monday. He'd been really working pretty hard on the IPO. I think hadn't met the media. I spoke to him on Monday night on the eve of the IPO.  when Middle East tensions were really at a peak. And actually, it's one of my first questions. How do you feel about listing in this kind of environment? So it is true that Virgin Australia has deep ties to the region. I mean, Qatar Airways owns 25% of the airline. Virgin Australia runs its long haul routes into Doha.  used in Qatar Airways aircraft. And that's how it advertises itself as a kind of Australian airline that offers long haul connections. But at the same time, it's low risk, low return strategy because Virgin Australia is not running its own aircraft. It's not getting huge returns. Really that connection with Qatar really serves to feed customers on to Virgin's domestic network. And that's where Virgin likes to make money.  much better for Virgin to compete in the domestic market than it is in the international market. So that's one aspect of that Middle East ties. Now, Emerson said, of course, if this lasts more than six months, then it starts to have an impact on all airlines. Oil prices might rise.  that would hurt all airlines. It's usually the first or second biggest cost for any airline. But for the moment, Virgin Australia is actually pretty well hedged for fuel costs for the next six months. So he was pretty pragmatic about listing in this environment. His words were, well, that's aviation. And of course it is. Aviation always goes through these geopolitical ruptures, doesn't it? And it always seems to come out the other side somehow, because people still want to fly."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 552.862, "text": " Angus, you've covered Australia's airline industry for more than a decade, and we know that last time Virgin was listed on the ASX, it had a bit of a tough time. What now do you see as the biggest challenges it faces this time round, given the variety of concerns about the global airline industry right now?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 574.398, "text": " Yeah, it did have a tough time, didn't it? I mean, I think that's putting it mildly. The stock hardly ever traded, relatively. And I don't think it really traded above the offer price as well as a publicly listed airline. So I think the big challenges it faces right now is managing this environment and showing it can sustain profits through what, frankly, are pretty good conditions at the moment.  There's a shortage of capacity worldwide, so people, airlines cannot get enough aircraft. Manufacturers can't pump them out fast enough. That allows airlines, including Virgin Australia, to charge a premium for seats and to fill their aircraft 85% full, as they are at the moment. That's a pretty good, what they call a load factor. Any airline would settle for that any time of the year.  The question is, can it do that when things are not in its favor? Can it sustain that position when perhaps aircraft come back onto the market in a few years' time? Can it continue to charge the right prices when there's a bit more competition in the market, for instance? And let's not forget, Virgin has capitalized on the lack of competition here. We've seen the collapse of Bonza.  and Rex as well. And that has served to boost Virgin just at the right time, really, before their IPO. So that has to some degree, not inflated profits, but certainly boosted them. The question is, can they do that when there's a bit more competition and things aren't so much in their favor?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 674.182, "text": "And when we come back, we'll unpack what the listing means for both investors in Virgin Australia and us, its passengers.

You're here with me, Rebecca Jones, and I'm talking to Angus Whitley, a reporter for Bloomberg News who covers the aviation industry. Angus, we just heard there from Dave Emerson talking on Tuesday about Virgin's improved balance sheet and its focus on domestic routes. How is Virgin positioning itself to take market share off its sworn rival? Should Qantas be worried?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 736.257, "text": " Well, do you know what? Bizarrely, it's not really trying to take market share off Qantas. There's been this long sort of ceasefire, if you like, between Virgin and Qantas, where they would just allow each other to have a third of the market in Virgin's case and two thirds of the market in Qantas' case.  you know, carve up the market in those kind of proportions. So I asked Dave Emerson, when I spoke to him on Monday, I said, you know, you've always been satisfied with a third. And his predecessor said she was going to draw the line at third as well. And he says, we don't need to take more market share. We just need to take more profit. So when you think about the market share, Qantas packs way more of a punch when it comes to profit. Qantas' profit is, you know, has been  in Australia. And Virgin's profit share is in the 20s, Emerson told me. So what he would like is to get that profit share to the same level as the market share. So about a third, a third of the market share, a third of the profit share. And that means competing where they've got pricing power. And so this time round, we've seen Virgin really let Qantas have the bottom of the market, Jetstar. You can have the low cost fares.  You're not going to be able to compete with you on that segment. And it's pretty much given quantities at the top of the market as well. The premium corporate customer, you can have that as well. We're not going to be able to compete in that segment either. But what Virgin thinks it can do is play through the middle ground. So it's looking  for the small business customer, the premium leisure, the value-oriented, in Emerson's words, corporate customer, that actually, to those companies, every dollar does matter. It's not just the big corporates who have an account with Qantas. No one will fly with Virgin because we're a bit more value conscious. And so, in that respect, Virgin's challenge is really about maximizing the profit in the segments where it's competing."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 867.253, "text": " So let's look at this now from a shareholder view with those two airlines competing in this duopoly space. What does Virgin have to offer shareholders this time around compared to what Qantas has got at the moment?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 17, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 884.468, "text": "I don't think it's terribly complicated. I mean, what do all investors want from a stock?  bit of growth, dividend. But I think in Virgin's case, I think the shares probably have to be a bit cheaper in relative terms than Qantas. Otherwise, if you're an investor in Australian aviation, why don't you just buy Qantas? It's the biggest carrier in the world. It's more diversified. It's got pricing power. It's got different brands.  So I think it's all about price. I know it's a cliche, but it is about price. If you're delivering sustainable profits that are getting bigger and delivering what you say you were going to do, then I think Virgin shareholders will be satisfied with that."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 940.11, "text": " Finally, how much does the loyalty business of both carriers come into this equation? Obviously, that's something that we've seen Vanessa Hudson, once she's taken the reins from Alan Joyce, really rethink that strategy completely. Should we be expecting any changes under Emerson at Virgin now that they've listed?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 963.569, "text": " It's worth, I think, pointing out just how important loyalty businesses are to airlines. They are really the glue that holds  business, even though they don't have any passengers, no aircraft, they're fast growing. Sometimes they have a value that's not far off the value of the airline itself. If you look at some of the analysis of the best loyalty businesses in the planet, and I'd have to say Qantas probably has one of them.  So this is really hard for Virgin competing with Qantas Loyalty. It's an absolute behemoth in the Australian market. Qantas Loyalty is, when I say the glue that holds the airline together, Qantas Loyalty is strong enough to really keep people flying with Qantas, no matter what  it does to them. Because if you're collecting Qantas points, you will forgive poor service, which any airline does deliver at some point. So if you had a bad experience with Qantas, you'll probably keep flying with them because you're collecting the points. So Virgin's challenge is really to get to that state where its passengers are collecting uniquely velocity points. And that's Virgin's frequent flight program, velocity. And that's a tall order.  And just to give you a few numbers, if you look at the revenue of Qantas, Frequent Floor and Velocity, it's about three billion Aussie dollars together. That sounds pretty good, right, in a year? Until you break out Virgin Share, not much more than 400 million. And then when you look at the number of members, Velocity has 13 million, Qantas has 17 million. So if you look at that disparity between the revenue share and the members, it's really huge.  Fair to conclude that Velocity is not packing a punch per user, right? So its challenge is really to get those 30 million members more engaged, more uniquely chasing Velocity points. And that's a tall order because really Qantas has that market wrapped up, I think, in Australia."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1096.219, "text": "Angus Whitley, thank you for joining me."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1098.6, "text": "Thanks, Bec."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1100.105, "text": " If you found today's conversation insightful, be sure to follow the Bloomberg Australia podcast wherever you listen, and check for more reading on Virgin, Qantas, and the business of travel, including the latest reporting from Angus Whitley on Bloomberg.com.

It's doing well, maybe not to the growth expectations that people had earlier this year, and will come out somewhere around a 2% growth.  with about 3% inflation. But whether it was NVIDIA, whether it was Micron, a lot of CapEx still going. A lot of companies in the AI space raising tremendous amounts of capital at high valuations with long list of investors coming in.  And the activity, as I said earlier, what's going on in Europe right now about that industrial renaissance, it's still going on.

Mr. President, over the decades there's a lot of conversation here in the Senate about deficits and debt. And every now and then there's a significant bipartisan effort to take on that challenge in a responsible way. But the biggest historic bipartisan effort occurred in 1974, just over half a century ago.  And in that effort, Democrats and Republicans together said, let's start using honest numbers when we're engaged in spending and revenue raising, so we'll quit having smoke and mirrors, quit pretending things are not what they are, quit selling, if you will, lipstick on a pig. Well, that effort created the Congressional Budget Office to get nonpartisan estimates.  That effort created a strategy of saying we will have a regular budgeting process, and for reducing the deficits, we'll have a special process called reconciliation, only for reducing the deficit. And that special process had three very significant components. One was that reconciliation would not be used to create any deficits in the budget window, that is, in the 10-year window.  The second is that it would not create any deficits in any single title, in any single year, any year after the first 10 years. And the third was that they would use, all of us would use, the nonpartisan numbers delivered to us on revenue through the Joint Committee on Taxation and on programs through the Congressional Budget Office. What an idea. We're going to be honest with ourselves.  And we're going to be honest with the American people about what our decisions cost. But along the way, my Republican colleagues preached fiscal responsibility, but became the masters, the kings of fiscal irresponsibility.  Let's look at the ways that they ran up deficit and debt here in the United States of America. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, $8 trillion, not to mention the incredible loss of life, some 7,000 service members, more than 50,000 service members with serious injuries.  And continuing on their deficit and debt-creating rampage, there was the Bush tax cuts in 2001, and the second Bush tax cuts of 2003, and the Trump tax cuts of 2017, all creating an ocean of red ink compromising the opportunity for us to do right by American families in health care, housing, education,  Great investments in technology and job creation because there is no government program that's better than a good-paying job. All of it compromised from the Republicans' ocean of red ink. But just making program decisions that created red ink wasn't enough for my colleagues across the aisle.  No, they decided to tear down the 1974 structure for fiscal responsibility. In 1996, they proceeded to say, you know what? We want to do a tax bill that will vastly lower taxes on the richest Americans. And we know it will create a mountain of deficit and debt  Democrats aren't going to vote for that, they said, and they were right. So they said, let's get a ruling. Let's get a ruling that allows us to do deficit creation with reconciliation, even though all 100 senators voted for reconciliation as a special filibuster-free pathway only for deficit reduction. It was really a dark moment for the Senate.  The majority brought in a new parliamentarian to get a ruling that reversed what everyone had understood in the 1974 law. And then they proceeded to use it three times already in 2001, 2003, 2017, and now they're doing it a fourth time. More red ink. And that amount is about $3.4 trillion.  And over 30 years, the debt they're creating, as compared to current law, is over $30 trillion of additional debt. $30 trillion. So please, don't come to this floor, I say to my colleagues across the aisle, and preach fiscal responsibility. If you can't walk the walk, don't talk the talk.  There's one way to be fiscally responsible, and that's not to vote for a bill that creates $3.5 trillion in debt over 10 years and more than $30 trillion in debt over the next 30 years. That's the way you be fiscally responsible. You do it with action, because actions speak louder than words.  It's part of what makes Americans so cynical to hear speeches about fiscal responsibility and then see the actions are the exact opposite. But there is a sense of embarrassment among many of my colleagues across the aisle because they've given speeches back home about fiscal responsibility.  So they don't like the idea of voting for a bill that creates $3.4 trillion in debt over 10 years, as compared to current law, or more than $30 trillion in debt over 30 years, as compared to current law. So they said, let's create a magic math baseline that pretends these provisions don't create debt. That is just  a horrific strategy to lie to ourselves, to lie to the American people about what this bill costs. This little myth being foisted on this chamber and the American people, they put a fancy name on it, they called it current policy baseline.  So let's revisit what's happened to the 1974 law. It said no deficit creation in a 10-year period. And Republicans tore that down in 1996 and used it now three times and now today a fourth time this week to create an ocean of red ink. Second of all, that 1974 agreement was there be no deficit created in any title in any year after that 10-year window.  This bill, this reconciliation bill, is tearing that down right now. The second main pillar being devastated because they're making the tax cuts permanent and then creating a phony baseline to say it doesn't really create additional deficits far into the future. But everybody in America knows it does.  Everybody in America knows that they're creating a phony baseline, doing exactly what was done before 1974, taking us to the same place where we're deceiving ourselves or attempting to and deceiving the American people. And then third of all is that they're tearing down the integrity of using honest numbers. So they tore down the 10-year agreement, no deficits in the first 10 years. Now they're tearing down the second pillar,  no deficits in any title in any year after the first 10 years. And now they're also tearing down the third pillar, be honest about the numbers. Now this strategy, this strategy, my colleagues across the aisle are saying, well, there's this provision in the budgeting law called Section 312. And it gives the Budget Committee  the power to resolve technical difficulties when we come to costing out programs. But what I am conveying to you right now is this not in the section of the law that deals with reconciliation. Section 310 deals with reconciliation. Section 313 deals with reconciliation. But Section 312, no. So here's what we have. This provision  The Republicans are saying they want to use, to give the budget chairman the power to create an artificial baseline to pretend this bill doesn't cost, and to be able to extend debts far into the future, or deficits far into the future, creating more debt.  It's never been used in a partisan manner before. Here are the times it's been used in all these different ways. Crime Victims Fund. Power Market Administrations. Preventing double counting of dairy program. Adjustments to the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Every single time a technical difficulty worked out in a bipartisan fashion. But I can assure you there's nothing bipartisan now about trying to use this in reconciliation.  This provision from 312, has it ever been used in this broad fashion, even on a regular budget bill on a broad fashion? No. It's been used on very narrow issues, time after time, in a bipartisan fashion. But that's been violated here.  Has it been used not to resolve an ambiguity, but to hide trillions of dollars of cost? No, it's always been used in that bipartisan, on a narrow issue, to resolve an ambiguity in costing out a program. Until now.  And to my core point, this power doesn't exist in the section of the budget bill that addresses reconciliation. Again, there's a regular budget process. There's a reconciliation process. So it's never been used in reconciliation.  The last point I'll make on this is because it's been narrow, because it's been resolving technical ambiguities, it's also addressed much more modest amounts of numbers. Normally in the millions, one time, $2.8 billion. But now it's being used to hide the $37 trillion score of this bill over 30 years. What a difference in every possible way.  So I say to my colleagues, don't tear down honesty and integrity in accounting for provisions. Section 313, if you go through it, it has different clauses. It says, establish the impact on outlays or revenue for each provision. Now, what that means is you take that provision that's in the bill, and you say, if it's in the bill, what is the impact?  on program costs and revenue. But if it's not in the bill, what is the impact and how does that compare? That's what costing out each provision means. It's inherently a comparison to existing law. Now, there's some inherent inconsistencies that accentuate the point I'm making.  If one uses this magic math to say you're going to assume that every tax provision that was in 2017 would have been automatically extended so it costs nothing, then you would have to also assume that every tax provision that has ended in this reconciliation bill after a couple years would also continue forever. But that's not the way that Republicans asked it to be costed out.  So they're having it both ways. An existing provision that they want to extend, they say, well, it would have been extended anyway, so it costs nothing. A provision that they are ending, they're saying, reduce the cost of this bill because we're ending the provision, and we're assuming no one to ever dare to extend it. That's just totally inconsistent, and it explains  Clearly, that this is a gimmick. Gimmick, capital G-I-M-M-I-C-K. Gimmick. A gimmick. Smoke and mirrors to deceive ourselves and the American people. Or let's take this. In that same reconciliation bill, there is a provision to lift the debt limit by some $5 trillion. The Senate Republicans increased it from the House that wanted to increase it by $4 trillion.  And they're saying this is enough to cover the next two years, because we're going to increase the debt so much, we need to have a $5 trillion cover. Well, if their story about the baseline, meaning that we're telling the people that this bill doesn't cost anymore, or costs very little compared to the Congressional Budget Office score of $3.4 trillion, they wouldn't need to increase.  the debt ceiling on top of what the House has already increased it. So let's come back to the core here. A hundred senators came together, created a responsible framework to bring control over deficits. No deficits in a 10-year period under reconciliation. Republicans broke it. No deficits in a single title in a single year after 10 years. Republicans are breaking it with this bill. Using honest numbers, Republicans breaking it in this bill.  Let's not break it. Let's say no. Every single colleague who's talked about fiscal responsibility, walk the walk. Tell your leadership we are not going to have this situation where we're voting for a bill that creates deficits decades into the future.  The only reason that score isn't higher than $37 trillion of additional debt over current law is because CBO cut off the accounting after three decades. So, colleagues, we're going to be voting on this bill probably Friday night. Maybe it's going to be 3 a.m. Saturday morning. Maybe it's going to be later on Saturday. But this bill doesn't deserve to go out of the Senate.  This deal thus absolutely shatters the remaining provisions for fiscal accountability in terms of the structure that was worked out in 1974. And it creates massive debt over a 10-year period as compared to current law. And here's the rub. It creates this debt primarily to give tax breaks to the richest Americans.  It cuts health care for 16 million Americans to give tax breaks to the richest Americans. It leaves 4 million children hungry to give tax breaks to the richest Americans. It runs up 3.4 trillion in debt over 10 years to give tax breaks to the richest Americans.  This is families lose, billionaires win. That is a terrible strategy for America. So simply say no. Oh, I know how much the tribal bonds are within the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. But it's our responsibility here on the floor to listen to each other and to vote honestly about the impact of this bill and this impact  Hurting families, helping billionaires is simply the wrong direction for the United States of America. Let's vote it down and work together for a vision in which families thrive and billionaires, they pay their fair share.

You've heard the impact that it's going to have on Alaska and your rescissions package cuts to public broadcasting won't just hurt communities' access to local news and education, but as you heard, it's going to cut critical funds for  Rural television and radio stations like WNMU in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, WKAR in Lansing and more, that provide emergency alert services during disasters and public safety situations. They're often the only folks that do that, particularly in rural America. Earlier this year, WCMU out of Mount Pleasant, Michigan saved lives.  when it stepped up to coordinate emergency information during a catastrophic ice storm in Michigan, when commercial towers went down. This is not a luxury, but it's a fundamental public responsibility. Public broadcasters are the backbone of emergency alerting, but I've heard from Michigan broadcasters, especially those in rural areas, that they may not survive if these cuts go through. That could mean no emergency alerts for over 250,000 residents  in the Upper Peninsula alone, not to mention the thousands more in Northern Michigan, Mid-Michigan, or the Thumb. So, Director Vogt, I just need a yes or no answer to this question. Were you fully aware of the emergency alert function that public broadcasters play when recommending eliminating these funds in the rescissions package?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 135.077, "text": " Senator, certainly aware of the extent to which public broadcasting has an impact on these communities.

He's a pretty prominent post-colonial scholar, studies colonialism in Africa, conflicts in Africa, that kind of thing. His mother is a pretty well-known movie director. She's made a bunch of different movies about, you know, focused, among other things, on the South Asian diaspora around the world.  His parents actually met in Uganda, and that's where, while she was on set for a, doing research for a movie, that's where Mamdani was born originally. And then, like I said, they moved to New York when he was seven years old. They've lived there ever since. He went to a private school in New York for most of his schooling, and then graduated from the Bronx School of Science. That's in the public school system in New York City. It's one of the best schools in the city.  After that, he went to Bowdoin College up in Maine, majored in Africana Studies, and then he kind of bounced around for a little while. He had a temporary career as a rapper. He did some community organizing. He worked on a couple political campaigns. So his work in the assembly is not the only political experience he has. He would say that his organizing, a valuable form of political experience there. One of his jobs was counseling people who were getting evicted from their homes or hiding their homes foreclosed on.  And he was helping them through that process. So lots of different careers there. He was also a tutor at one point, became a citizen in 2018, a naturalized citizen of the United States, and then ran for office and won in 2020.

The mayor of New York and the city of New York have control over the rent in a lot of rent control departments all over New York City. They've allowed that rent, under Eric Adams, the current mayor, they've allowed that rent to go up as, you know, both as inflation has occurred, but also as, you know,  landlords need to do maintenance, that kind of thing. That's the general idea of why you would increase the rent. Mondani has said that the landlords who own these rent-controlled apartments are making too much profit on them. He points to some statistics that show that profit on some of these units went up by 12% last year, for example. And so he says he's going to freeze the rent. He's not going to allow landlords to raise rent on those rent-controlled tenants while he is in office. So that's one really big proposal that he has come out and said he's gonna do.  But he also had a whole plethora of other proposals that can focus on that cost of living in New York issue. He has talked about building more housing. That's another piece of expanding the housing supply. He's talked about opening a network of city owned grocery stores that he thinks might be able to offer groceries at lower costs than for profit grocery stores.  He's talked about making the bus system in New York free to use so that people don't have to pay to use the bus. So you've got all these ideas. And again, laser focused, it really seemed to me, on trying to address cost of living issues. There are a lot of folks who say that  you know, his approach wasn't going to work unnecessarily. You know, there are examples of some of these policies working in some places and not working in others. That's certainly the critique that Cuomo levied at him and also some of his other rivals in the Democratic primary.

The following statements are about President Trump's so-called big, beautiful bill. Try to guess whether a Senate Democrat or a Senate Republican made the following statement. Statement number one, if we don't watch out, people are going to get hurt. People are going to be upset. It's going to be the number one thing on the nightly news all over the place.  Statement two, reference to the big beautiful bill, I'm concerned if there are cutbacks in some of the Medicaid programs, it could have an adverse effect on our rural hospitals. Many of them are barely making it now financially. Statement number three, on the subject of slashing Medicaid payments, this is a whole new system that is going to defund rural hospitals. If you guessed that all three statements were made by Senate Republicans,  about the Republican reconciliation bill. You're right. Even my Republican colleagues know that under Trump's plan, billionaires will win and American families will lose. The more we learn about this bill, the worse it looks. Perhaps that's why the Senate Republican leader is anxious to pass the bill before the arbitrary 4th of July deadline. It is expensive. Yesterday, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Republican proposal will add  $4.2 trillion to our national debt. In Trump's first term, in that four-year period of time, he added more debt, money to the debt of the United States than any president in four years in history. Now he's going to top that number with this new big, beautiful bill, adding to our national debt. And does the proposal borrow against the future in order to lift millions of children out of poverty or invest in clean energy jobs for the future?  will grow the economy. Think again. This bill provides tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy. One of my colleagues did a calculation here. If you make a cutoff point of an income of $400,000 a year and say that we won't give any of the new Trump tax breaks to people making more than $400,000 a year,  you eliminate 60% of this tax proposal. 60% of it goes to people making over $400,000 a year. What about at the highest levels, 0.1% income? The tax break, permanent tax cut, annually is nearly $350,000. Come on. Do you really believe Elon Musk is waiting to see this, whether this goes through, so he can take this tax break and spend it on something worthwhile?  Not at all. The richest people in the United States, God bless them, don't need this tax cut. Working families do. And it's unpopular. A recent Fox News poll, did I say Fox? Fox News poll found that 38% of registered voters supported the House-passed bill. 59% opposed it. And it's downright mean. This measure would be the most significant health care cut in American history. 16 million Americans would lose their health insurance.  I heard one Republican senator on the news say, well, that's just health insurance that we're providing for illegal aliens. He's wrong. The Medicaid doesn't cover them. Medicaid people who would be denied coverage, 16 million of them are American citizens. Medicaid cuts will lead to higher co-pays, longer emergency room wait times, and skyrocketing nursing home expenses. So many of our senior citizens in my state and other places are in places to take care of them.  They need a helping hand, a nursing facility and the like. The majority of that is being paid for by Medicaid, and the Republicans want to cut that Medicaid reimbursement. What's that going to do when you're trying to take care of your mom and your grandmother if you can't afford to keep them in a good place? In an extreme situation, they may have to move in with you and change your own lifestyle and your own relationship within your family. One provision in particular in the Republican bill  will cripple the funding mechanism used to keep hospitals afloat. According to Children's Hospital Association, this provision in the Republican bill will cut funding for most children's hospitals by 42%. So do you have a children's hospital in your town, in your state?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "Unidentified SPEAKER", "start": 273.033, "text": "42%."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 273.814, "text": "Ask them what that will mean in terms of services for kids in your home. Take Children's Mercy. It's the children's hospital in Kansas City.  serving kids in Missouri and Kansas. 35% of its revenue is from Medicaid, and the hospital operates with a 5% margin. If you take a chainsaw to Medicaid, families with six kids who trust children's mercy will have another worry on their minds. And in red and blue states, rural hospitals will be in jeopardy of closing. For what? For a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America? Really? Don't take it from me.  I recently spoke with the CEO of BJC Health, the largest hospital system in Missouri, and a third of their patients are from Illinois, I might add. I asked about their concern with people losing insurance under this Republican bill. This is BJC out of St. Louis, Missouri. BJC Healthcare cares for more Medicaid patients than any other health organization in the region. More than a third of their patients are covered by Medicaid, paying one million visits a year.  It's the same story for SSM Health, headquartered in St. Louis, operating nine hospitals in Missouri, including the famous hospital Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. SSM's CEO expressed her, quote, deep concerns about the proposed Medicaid changes in the Republican bill, stating that the Republican bill, quote, threatens coverage for millions of people and jeopardizes financial stability of safety net providers like SSM Health. For what?  for a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America. 60% of this tax cut goes to people making over $400,000 a year. And at the highest levels, $346,000 annual cut in taxes for the richest people in America so that we can cut back on these hospitals. In Missouri, 250,000 individuals are expected to lose coverage under the Republican plan, resulting in Missouri hospitals facing an increase  of $430 million in uncompensated care costs in a single year. I know these numbers are numbing, there's so many of them, and they're so big, but let's get down to the basic message. Hospitals that are hanging on, rural hospitals, hospitals in the inner city, children's hospitals, are the ones that are making it barely each and every year. They're the ones who will lose replacement of funds by Medicaid under the Republican plan.  What would the cuts mean for rural hospitals in Missouri? Already 10 rural hospitals are in jeopardy of closing. This Republican bill could be the final straw, and I hear exactly the same message across the river in Illinois. I heard this message from UnityPoint Health, which has hospitals in Illinois and in Iowa. They told me that Medicaid covers nearly 40% of the children born at their hospital, and they rely on provider taxes  to offer maternal emergency and behavioral health services. If Republicans have their way, these critical services are in jeopardy and some will go away. Todd Patterson, the CEO of Washington County Hospital in Iowa said, quote, Medicaid is not a line item. It is a cornerstone. When policymakers in Washington slash Medicaid funding, they're turning off the oxygen for rural health care. I will tell you, I've grown up and  Downstate Illinois, and I've represented it in Congress and the Senate. These hospitals are critical to the economy of these communities. You take the hospital out of a community, you've taken the major employer and a major economic factor. Try to attract a new business and explain the hospital is two hours away. Try to keep a new business in town when the hospital is going down. Currently, 107,000 people in Iowa are projected to lose health insurance under this plan.  It would increase annual uncompensated care costs for hospitals by nearly $190 million. Republicans in Iowa and Missouri get sick and rely on their hospitals just like Democrats. My colleagues know these Medicaid cuts would be devastating. And no Band-Aid hospital grant fund that Republicans are frantically trying to create will make up for this seismic hole. While President Trump said he would protect Medicaid,  He is now pressuring Republicans to make deep cuts in the program. He's asking Republicans to choose billionaires over hardworking American families. Now is the real test for Senate Republicans. Mr. President, I can remember when it occurred during Trump's first term. Another tax bill, another massive increase in the national debt. How were they ever going to pay for it? Well, there was a proposal that cut back on the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.  And that cutback was hanging by one vote in the balance. I was sitting here at this chair and watched as John McCain came through that set of doors at 2 o'clock in the morning. He was the deciding vote. John McCain walked to the well and gave a no and saved the Affordable Care Act from Trump's first term. Now we're going through this scenario again, again. Another Trump tax cut, more cuts when it comes to medical care, particularly for families who are the most vulnerable.  Will anyone rise to the occasion as John McCain did? We need four Republicans to stand up and say, enough. Stop penalizing the families of America and the rural hospitals of America and the small town hospitals of America for a tax break for wealthy people. We're better than that in America. It's time we need four Republicans with good sense to step up before it's too late.

A typical family in South Dakota will face a $2,500 tax hike. Republicans are determined  to make sure that that doesn't happen. And later this week, we'll consider our reconciliation bill that will prevent that tax hike by extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I say extend, Mr. President, but we're doing a lot more than just extending the 2017 tax cuts. We're making them permanent. And in some cases, we're even improving on them. Mr. President, our 2017 tax relief legislation lowered tax rates for every income group. It doubled the child tax credit.  It nearly doubled the standard deduction. The bill we're voting on this week will make all of that permanent. And it will go even further when it comes to the child tax credit, increasing it to $2,200 per child and linking it to inflation. Again, permanently. And we're not stopping there. Our bill suspends taxes on TIPs, boosting the incomes of millions of Americans who are in TIP income.  It suspends taxes on overtime pay for millions of American workers, meaning police officers, firefighters, nurses and others will be able to keep more of what they earn when they spend long hours away from their families. And an increased standard deduction for seniors will allow them to reduce their tax burden even further. Mr. President, the American people have better uses for their hard-earned money than sending it to Uncle Sam. And this bill will permanently ensure that Americans can keep more of what they earn.  Mr. President, the other legacy of the 2017 tax cuts is how they boosted our economy by lifting the tax burden on America's job creators. We lowered tax rates for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms and ranches. We made it easier for them to recover the cost of investing in their businesses, which in turn freed up cash for them to invest in their operations and their workers. These and other major reforms helped kick-start our economy.  And in the wake of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our economy grew at a substantially better rate than projected. Real wages increased. Unemployment fell to a 50-year low. The poverty rate fell to the lowest level ever recorded. Business investment increased. Everywhere you looked, there was positive economic news. Mr. President, we were able to make some of the business tax reforms permanent in 2017. And now,  we have an opportunity to make the rest of these pro-growth policies permanent. That includes lower rates for small and medium-sized businesses, the job-creating 199A small business deduction, and full expensing for new equipment and for domestic research and development. And once again, we're going beyond just making the 2017 tax relief permanent. We're setting our country up  for a brighter future by further advancing a pro-opportunity, pro-growth tax code. Our bill includes full expensing for new factories and factory improvements so we can expect to see more growth and more jobs for American workers and more goods made in America. It raises the death tax threshold to $15 million and links it to inflation permanently.  which will spare countless family farms, ranches, and small businesses from a potentially devastating tax and the headaches and expense of planning for it. And an entire generation of Americans will be able to access new investment accounts when they reach adulthood that can be used toward their education, to start a business, to buy their first home, and to get a running start on the American dream. Mr. President, this is a good bill.  And it's going to be great for our country. The Council of Economic Advisers, which accurately predicted the economic growth and higher wages in the wake of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, released its forecast of the Senate bill this morning. It contains a lot of good news, starting with as much as 4.9 percent higher GDP in the next few years. That means more jobs. It means bigger paychecks, as much as $10,000 per year for a typical family. It means  more opportunity. And I, and I should say, and believe it or not, it means more revenue. Revenue that we bring in in the right way, by growing our economy, not by raising taxes. In fact, the same forecasters that got the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act right are estimating as much as $6 trillion in deficit reduction stemming from the bill's pro-growth policies.  Mr. President, we're well on our way to getting this bill passed this week, which means we're well on our way to a stronger and more prosperous America. That means Americans keeping more of their hard-earned money. It means American businesses growing and investing in our country and in our workers. And it means a thriving economy like we had before the pandemic. Mr. President, Republicans are ready to deliver.  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of quorum."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

I would also say that one, thank you, let me echo what Senator Reid said, thank you for your independence and doing the job. At the end of the day, I think tariffs are a tax and they're going to hit, they're going to hit, I think, starting next quarter. And again, I think the  reciprocity argument, that would be a nice goal.

I can tell you some of the doge approach in the national security and intel world.  cuts are having dramatic effects. But today I want to mention something that frankly doesn't get a lot of attention, a very small entity, the Bureau of Labor Statistics. U.S. economic data, which has always been independent, it's really been viewed as the gold standard across the globe. And frankly, the BLS data often is the guidepost that investors use regularly.  BLS helps us get information about cost of living increases, policymaking for you guys. It's used to adjust payments on the roughly $2 trillion in treasury bonds. The truth is that the BLS data shouldn't be degraded on any basis, yet the administration is so dramatically, and I hope my Republican colleagues will hear on this, cut back the staffing at BLS  that the BLS has had to significantly cut back on the collection of critical price and inflation data. Normally, BLS staff, when you don't have all the data collected, will estimate about 10% of the inputs into the CPI. Now, with these cutbacks, they've had to estimate close to 30% of the data. That means faultier data.

And it really helps not just policymakers, but also businesses if we have accurate information about what's going on in the economy.  You're making decisions based on that economy, not just the Fed, not just you, but private companies as well. So I think it's something we should continue to invest in.

Those of us who are involved in Dodd-Frank, really important as we try to particularly think about the most significant banks.

If I would have told you that Donald Trump will give the Republic of Iran 60 days to come to a peace deal and willingly give up their nuclear program, that on day 61, Israel would go in, knock out their missile defense system, so they would own the skies over Iran, that they would have  operatives on the ground with drones inside of Iran, ready to take out top nuclear scientists, top generals, simultaneously devastating their missile batteries, ballistic missile systems and two nuclear sites, and then culminating with, Saturday night, Donald Trump knocking out the three nuclear sites that mattered and obliterating them. And then, at the end of 12 days, we'd have a ceasefire that's holding.  I don't think I would have believed it. I would have said, no way.

Look, Trump is very disciplined. People don't realize this, because there's so much noise around him. But he's very disciplined. He has a clear vision of what he wants to get done. He knows how to build a team. And I thought he showed an enormous capacity and a great deal of courage in being patient. He had all sorts of friends, as you know. He had all sorts of friends who were worried about him. Was he going to go wobbly? Was he going to get weak? No. He had a clear deadline.  He artfully said to the world, I would really like to avoid this. I hope the Iranians will work with me. I'm giving them 60 days. And I'm confident that he and Bibi had an agreement months ago. On day 61, the Israelis could launch a plan, which they have been working on for years. And then, after they finish cleaning up the entire air defense system, if they called him and said, you know, we really do need help to take out these three facilities,  We had a plan, which I think started eight or nine years ago in planning. And we also taught the world a lesson. We can launch bombers from Missouri to anywhere in the world and have precision targets that are annihilating. And we are prepared to defend America and to defend America's allies. Now, to me, the test is going to be, what are the terms of the truce?  Are the Iranians, in fact, going to try to cheat, or are they going to recognize that, between Israel and the United States, they're in a total overmatch and they can't possibly succeed?

Once those handouts go away, the retail spending drops. And we are seeing  a very weak consumer price index, down for four straight months in May. That signals deflation.

First, personal note, thank you very much for all the kind words about my brother. I didn't cover the mayoral election or even comment on it here at NewsNation for obvious reasons. And my feelings about my brother and what he should do now, those are personal, not professional. So suffice it to say, I love and support my brother and I'm not worried about him. Second, I get why many of you were surprised by the Democratic primary results.  in New York City. I was not. Two reasons. One is that it was a low-turnout race that people did not think could go the way it did. The enthusiasm and turnout energy were over-weighted for the more extreme candidates, as is often the case. And that's one of the problems with our binary system and with our closed primaries. And there were several radical choices in the mix.  Not to mention, and contrary to what was sold by his opponents, Andrew's no establishment guy and the party was not loving that he ran. But that's his case to make, okay? The second reason I wasn't surprised is actually worth talking about here because it affects the entire nation. The Democratic Party is now officially in MAGA mode.  We are now on both sides in a period of extremism. The same way MAGA played with the prejudices of white nationalism, you're seeing an identical dynamic on the left with prejudices like tacitly supporting extreme Islamism or targeting Jews. For the right, it's migrants. For the left, it's Jews. It's fundamentalist Christians dominating the right. It's fundamentalist Islamists making headway on the left.  I know that doesn't sound like Democrats, but that party is dead. What it will be reborn as, we'll see. And this is not about Muslims, at least not for me. It's about extremism. Yes, Islam is growing in the country. In a few decades, the Muslim population is projected to double in size as a share of our overall population.  I do not agree, however, with our president that Islam hates us. I don't care if you're a Muslim, a Jew, a Christian, or any other faith, or if you think faith is for fools. It's how you use your beliefs to justify your actions that I care about. And what we're seeing now is that there are many in America who are adopting and adapting to fundamentalism.  The outcome in this election wasn't about affordability or about real change. The winner is an open socialist and the Democratic Party is now just that, socialistic. But be clear, this is a fictional fix for very real frustrations. An extreme suggestion of free everything that sounds great to those who feel cheated by the system because they are cheated by the system. But this is never going to happen.  It makes sense that the left would want to match what beat them. If you think about it, a populist movement that's grounded in grievance. So now they're hatching their own kind of, you know, if you can't beat him, join him move, fueled by what? Outrage against Trump. He is the devil.  legitimate disgust at income inequality, a lack of affordability, especially in big cities, and the obvious and skewed outcomes in our society. And there is truth to the outrage, just like there was on the MAGA side. It does seem that the system helps the top, that there are two sets of rules, that the gaps only get bigger, and that everything that has been promised in the past by the establishment has failed.  That's why the establishment or old guard or system or institutions are all being targeted.  And I'm okay with that. Depending on what, if anything, follows, that's better, okay? And by the way, this as a device in politics is not new. And it works. The French Revolution was led by screams of, kill the rich, and that was 1789. And the influences then were Marxists and Communists, just like they are on the left today. So I will borrow from the French for a word for what this is. It's a revolt.  That's what it is, a rejection of how things are done in that party and in this country. But that's not all it is. Here's what we've learned, my observation. A populist movement these days needs something else.  Something extreme. Pod bros play to conspiracies. Trump played to type, white fright, danced with evangels who wanted religious indoctrination with the state. Christmas is back, right? He authorized minorities, build the wall, they're sending rapists, they are eating the dogs, they're eating the cats. Trans sports, the brown menace of migrants, bad hombres.  So the left is now generating what I call its reaction formation to that, an equal opposite, a mirror image. What is that? It's an affinity for and appropriation of oppression of minorities. The same people that he targets, they champion. Islam hates us, we're for Islamists. Woke is not enough. Why? Too many are broke to focus on woke.  Political correctness overcorrected, canceling is passe, and certainly not extreme enough to match what they must muster to get a movement in the crowded, angry echo chamber. But to go full MAGA in the opposite direction, that seems to fit. And that's what we are living in this moment. Playing to how the poor are oppressed here and elsewhere has gotten traction, and it should.  But that's why you see Free Everything, anti-police, pro-Hamas, not even rejecting calls to globalize the intifada, outrage at ICE, embracing the anger of those rejected by MAGA. The latest? You see the violence? You see the murders?  They're not angry jihadis, right? They're American men who have been disaffected and enraged and are now all too comfortable with an extreme reaction in advance of their policies of politics.  That's what it's about. That's extremism playing out in our ranks and being adopted by the left and the right fringe as well. But that's what it is. A battle of extremes. The latest? Trying to make the regime in Iran a victim and insisting the bombing had to be a failure.  Now, will this new iteration of the left work? I don't know. Trump certainly took the bait, right? He came at the winner here in New York City. That only helps him. And he didn't even mention Mayor Adams, who's supposed to be his guy, which is also telling about what the president values and is concerned about. So the better question is not,  if this movement will win an election or two, but whether it will create positive change. See, my big criticism of MAGA, and now it's what was the Democratic Party's opposite, whatever they decide to call it, my problem is that they successfully take advantage of real angst, real pain, but they rarely deliver. We know many who signed up for MAGA, but they did not sign up for a lot that has come to pass.  groceries and gas and the economy and less foreign entanglements. None of that has worked out as promised, at least not yet. And I suspect we would see the same on the radical left. America will not go socialist or Islamist. Now, one good aspect with MAGA and the radical left and whatever they decide to call this movement, it's not for me to name it. We'll see.  There should be change. The establishment should be attacked. But breaking disruption is easy and incomplete.  if there is not reformation or improvement. My pop always said, and he was a real Democrat, by the way. He was a real one. He didn't just piss off workers or minorities or underprivileged or target enemies and make you angry. He was not a demagogue. He was a Democrat. He fought to make real changes that were reasonable, and he did.  He used to say, any jackass can kick down a barn, but it takes a lot more to build one. And that's what's missing on the fringe of both sides. They do not have the ideas or the execution to make things better. They just talk the talk. Where is the work of real immigration reform in this administration?  Yes, the border is closed down, laws are being enforced, but you know we need legislation, right? I've had the head of the CBP. I've had Tom Homan, the ICE czar here. What do they want? Rule changes and resources that take legislation. Where are the deals? It's not a coincidence on the left either. Bernie and AOC are the faces of this new movement.  Now, I respect the senator and I respect the representative's passion, and they have both done well getting famous, but they have never made any change.  It is odd that people who are so desperate for better, and they should be, are so often deceived by those who promise everything and deliver nothing. If only getting things done sold as well as burning things down. Six years in office for AOC, almost 20 for Bernie, and almost nothing to show for it in terms of delivering on what they say they want. And why is that?  Because we are a capitalist country, not a socialistic one, and never will be.  And the majority does not embrace extremism, at least not yet. And I say that because every day, extremism floods our coverage, floods our social media culture, was a big player in this election and in the last national one. The polls don't work anymore the way they used to. Social media is what drives turnout, and you can't measure it with a poll and samples the way they used to.  Learn that lesson. Polls are just ways to advance narratives for the media. They are rarely predictive and certainly not more than a picture of a moment in time. All right? And we see it not just last night, but today in the reaction to the bombing in Iran.  And I want to get after that. Why is there so much push from the left and the media to say they failed? Why ignore that a ceasefire came about as a result of them? How is that not success? Sure, it's fragile. Sure, it's tenuous. But it's better than it was before. And how could we not have made an impact on the enrichment operation? So today, sure enough, we get more proof that it wasn't a complete disaster. It didn't do nothing.  And we know what it's about. And I'm not saying that the president doesn't ask for it, but a lot of this is an outgrowth of an insistence that if Trump did it, it's got to be attacked.  And that gets us nowhere but worse in a constant comparison of which side is worse. I say follow the facts when it comes to what the bombings did and did not do, not feelings about who's in office. So what do we know and what matters? The effectiveness of the strikes, let's talk to somebody, okay? I'm not gonna go off a leaked Pentagon report that claims that they didn't totally destroy Iran's nuclear program. Who said totally destroyed? When was that the bar? It was about stopping them from getting one.  Trump said today he's seen new intelligence that the sites were obliterated. Now, I think this was a mistake for him to say if he can't prove it, but here's what he said.  The document said it could be very severe damage, but they didn't take that. They said it could be limited or it could be very severe, because it was very early after. Since then, we've collected additional intelligence. We've also spoken to people who have seen the site, and the site is obliterated. And we think everything nuclear is down there. They didn't take it out. Look, we're going to talk to them next week with Iran.  We may sign an agreement, I don't know. To me, I don't think it's that necessary. I mean, they had a war, they fought, now they're going back to their world. I don't care if I have an agreement or not.  Well, but he does have to care that they don't try to restart the program. I mean, that's the whole point, right? So because there is this push to say that Trump screwed it up, now you're going to see something that you don't usually take. Because if he's going to do one thing heavy and hard, it's defend himself. So the CIA releases a statement. They cite what they claim is a historically accurate source and method that confirms key Iranian nuclear facilities have been destroyed and would take years to rebuild.  So what does that mean, and is that enough? I want to bring in somebody who knows, former director of the CIA, former commander of the military's US Central Command, General David Petraeus. It's good to see you, General. It's been a second. Good to be back, Chris. So one, you are politically savvy as well. What do you make of this insistence that the bombings failed? And what do you look at for proof?  Frank, I haven't seen people say the bombings fail. It's really a debate over how much damage was done. The DIA report apparently that was leaked was actually low confidence in what they actually said. So it should not have been given all that credence to begin with. I tend to think  that the CIA statement, it aligns frankly with my own estimation, which is that severe damage was done to the program. And I think that's about where it should stay until you have the complete battle damage assessment done. And that takes time. There's no set limit for it. You could have a breakthrough. The CIA may have had access to something that enables them to make that statement with  high confidence, which is what you really want to see. There are reports that the Israelis actually had some monitors and so forth that may be the case as well. But you can't help but look at the photographs and realize that you have these punched holes  in the mountainside, that's good actually. That means that it did what it's supposed to, which is to go down into the mountain over time, hundreds of feet. Each one of those culminates its descent with explosion of 5,000 pounds of explosive. You do 12 of those and it will have done enormous damage to any centrifuges that are in there. Just the sheer blast damage will be significant to these very sensitive instruments.  And then if there is the highly enriched uranium in there, as was the case, I believe there were trucks outside there, maybe some have moved on. And these are questions that do need to be answered. But I think it's important to be a bit measured at this moment in time and just say, we can clearly see that there was very substantial damage done to really all of the nuclear facilities, but especially the three that we followed up the Israeli damage with our submarine launch cruise missiles  And then these massive ordinance penetrators. And then we'll see. Bigger question is, was there any high enriched uranium that was stored elsewhere or was taken out for these strikes? And are there centrifuges that are elsewhere as well? Certainly some were in the manufacturing process that may have been stored somewhere else, this kind of thing. That's what we need to determine.  And when that's determined, either I think Iran will have to agree to dismantle its entire nuclear program, and I'd like to see that kind of agreement, and to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to go anywhere they want at any time they want to oversee the process and to verify and validate it, or Israel will bomb it again. And I think those that say, well, they only said it back a few years,  If that's the case, in a few years Israel will bomb again. I think people do not appreciate how significant 10-7 was for the Israelis in their strategic context. They will no longer allow a threat to be built on their borders or even in the region the way they did tolerate that in the past with Hezbollah in Lebanon, with Hamas in Gaza, with  other proxies elsewhere, and then especially with Iran at home. And I think that's the new reality of the Israeli defense strategy. And I'm quite confident that if, again, material is discovered elsewhere, and one would think given the intelligent penetration that Mossad demonstrated in the early days of this operation in particular, which  So extraordinary, 12 days and not even a single plane shot down, much less a maintenance problem reported that forced the pilot to bail out. It's really quite extraordinary. And our operation of 125 aircraft was very, very impressive as well.  I mean, obviously, you also have the collateral damage, and that's a very impersonal way to put it. You know, they didn't just kill the specific targets. There were a lot of citizens that were hurt as well. And I think that the most sympathetic actor in the entire equation are the people of Iran that are held hostage by that regime. I want to ask you one question that's kind of pseudo-political. There is a narrative now  a way of thinking, let's say, in America, that we don't get anything from the alliance with Israel, that they get everything, they get the Iron Dome, they get all of this leverage because they have the big guerrilla of the United States standing behind them, but that all the money and all the support doesn't really benefit the United States and that it should change. What is your response to that notion?  Well, look at what they have done to Lebanese Hezbollah, which prevented any progress in Lebanon for a very long period of time. And that's very advantageous for the region in many, many ways. And of course, that region, what really matters, as always, even though we are now net exporters of crude oil and huge exporters of liquid natural gas, is the flow of oil and gas out to the countries that  it actually fuels the global economy. They've dramatically reduced Iran's threat to the region. All of the countries were subject to various challenges from Iran over the years or from their proxies. Hamas, that job's not done by any means, but dramatically degraded, and they're not going to be able to be helped by Iran now. And then some of the other proxies that they have as well.  These have been murderous. During the surge in Iraq alone, hundreds of our soldiers were killed by the explosively formed penetrators provided to the Shia militia in Iraq by Iran. So seeing Iran cut down in this way and their capabilities, I think, is very, very positive for a region that is very important.  to the world. Beyond that, there's the moral obligation, I think, that we should take and do take very seriously about a country that we helped bring into existence and repeatedly have come to the rescue of at various times when that was needed, the October 73 war in particular, but others as well.  And again, we get a great deal in return when it comes to intelligence sharing, especially partnership in a variety of respects in that world. And then also our defense alliance is very important as well, a defense partnership. General Petraeus, I appreciate your perspective as always. Thank you for being part of the conversation here on NewsNation.  Good to be with you, Chris. Thanks. All right. I'll see you again, General. Be well. Four minutes and 35 seconds coming up. So Trump seemed to have successfully taken on the regime, at least for the moment. What does Bill O'Reilly thinks? What does he think matters in terms of assessing what happened here? And what does he make of the state of play in our politics? The big man next.  Let's bring in the big man, Bill O'Reilly. Good to have you. What is your take on the state of play in the analysis of what happened in Iran? Well, CNN used four anonymous sources to try to diminish the bombing raid, what they do. But even worse was the news outlets have picked it up as fact.  So anonymous sources are easy. You can get anybody to say anything. And when I read the article, I said, how do these anonymous sources know? There's nobody on the ground there. There's nobody going under the mountain to see. The Iranians can't even do that because the mountain may collapse on them. There's absolutely no primary source reporting on the damage that the American planes caused. None.  So you got four anonymous people saying, well, I might have heard this, I might have heard that. It's absurd. No competent journalistic editor would have printed that article. But since CNN is in business to make Trump look bad, as you said, every moment of every day, they throw it out there. But I think we all know that the journalism industry in America and the world is at the lowest ebb, the lowest point.  in the history of that industry is right now. I think that it's trying too hard to compete with these pod bros and people who sell hysteria for profit. And we should just stick to what we do best, because in truth, podcasts have their place. Don't get me wrong. I love having one. But they don't have any of the assets or capabilities of getting things right or reporting or investigating the way real news agencies do.  too often get caught up in the propaganda game. The only thing I disagree with you on is, and of course Trump asked for it by saying everything was obliterated, so he asks for the criticism, because he doesn't know that either, but anonymous sources matter, Bill. If it weren't for anonymous sources in your career and mine, very often you wouldn't know anything about what's happening in the halls of power because people aren't going to put their name to things because they get fired. So anonymous sources have their place, you just got to get it right.  I don't use them. And I've been pretty damn successful for 50 years in this business. I don't use them. Now, if I'm told something, I check it out another way. And you can always do that. If I had something vital, like there was going to be an explosion at this address tonight,  And I had to get it out. I would tell people why I'm doing the anonymous source thing if I had to do it. But I don't use them. I don't do a podcast. I do a broadcast. And you're absolutely right. The podcasters couldn't care less about what's true or what isn't. They just want people to watch. They want attention. And that's what they do. And it's a huge industry. But I disagree with you about CNN. CNN knows better.  They're so desperate to try to get some kind of surge of people to watch that they'll do any, they'll violate every generation. Well, they see what's happening on the left. And look, again, you and I disagree about CNN. Even though I got fired, I have a lot of respect for the men and women who are doing the job there. And I miss a lot of them. And I think it's a great place.  When they're wrong, they're wrong. When they do things they shouldn't, they shouldn't. I don't blame the whole place. You've got to look at the specific platform. But they see what's happening on the left. You see that they're in MAGA mode. And they are all in on the mirror image of MAGA. That's what's going on there now. There are no more Democrats. There are no more Republicans. There's MAGA, and now you have whatever they call the new lefty MAGA. I don't know what it's going to be called.  Look, all I want is for every news agency to try to be fair and accurate in its reporting. Is that too much to ask, Cuomo? Am I asking too much? It's just too much to ask if they want to be successful, because there is very little percentage in fairness. People want fealty. They want outcomes. They want comfort. They want reassurance. I'm sorry. I'm making millions of dollars, Cuomo.  being fair and accurate. That's what I'm selling. Okay, so you're wrong, and I got the receipts to prove it. You see yourself as a fair broker? People are hungry.  And I am. And you're going to challenge that. You better have a backup. Because if I say it otherwise, it can't be true. I think that you have a tendency to defend the administration and conservatives and attack liberals and Democrats. I think that you do more of that than you do of that. That's your opinion.  If you watch what you don't every day, you would see that isn't true. I'm going after a Republican in charge of the Ethics Committee in the House now. I don't care about ideology. I don't care about party. It's the last thing on my mind. And as far as Trump is concerned, I'm fair to Trump. And I'm accurate about Trump. And I tell you what is going on. I have not been wrong on this program.  I've told you exactly what's going on, why he does what he does. Well, you thought that he was going to be patient and wait on Iran, and then it happened the next day. So, I mean- Well, it was a timing issue."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1554.307, "text": "It doesn't matter if you're right or wrong about that stuff."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1557.029, "text": "And that was a mistake, but it wasn't a mistake about trying to make Trump look good. It was a timing issue. But anyway, look, what we are doing at NewsNation is trying  to do accurate reporting without this insane injection of partisan ideology. I think you would agree with that. But that's all. I mean, you'll get fired otherwise. I mean, News Nation has a very specific code of conduct of what it wants to do, which I also think is emblematic of the difference between this and digital media, is that I have bosses  who watch and listen, and if you don't do it the way they want it done, which is be fair to both sides when called for, you got a problem. Podcasts don't have that.  Look, you're fading out a little, so wake the audio guy up, jack his audio up. Technical stuff is not our strong point here. We kind of just, you know, we focus on the content, not the production. The guy just woke up because I scolded him. If you're right about NewsNation, and you are, then why are they hiring me if I'm such a partisan right-wing guy?  Balance. Come on. No, no balance. Then you'd have to have a kooky, you know, the only left wing zealot you have on a consistent basis is Carville. And it's OK with me. I don't care. But look, your producer wanted me to talk about Putin a little bit, because this is the next step in foreign policy. And I think it's important.  So my book, Confronting Evil, comes out on September 9th. And I'm extraordinarily lucky, because I have the Ayatollah and Putin on the cover, along with Mao and Hitler. And then we have eight other villains inside the book. We researched Putin. We investigated Putin. Putin is a true psychopath. He is a psychopath. But he's different than the mullahs. And this is what people need to understand, because he's driving Trump crazy. Putin's driving Trump nuts.  I don't know if President Trump understands what a psychopath this man is. And when you see how he was raised, when you see where he came from and how he assembled power, there is no doubt of what I'm saying is accurate. So Putin, unlike the mullahs, is not a coward. The mullahs are cowards, OK? They pay people to kill babies and women. That's what the mullahs do. They're despicable cowards.  Putin isn't a coward, and you'll see that in the book. Putin is right in your face, and he is going to wreak as much destruction on the world as he can until somebody puts him in the grave. That's him. And Trump can't get through. Trump has offered him a really good deal.  But Putin doesn't want the deal because Putin doesn't see that as helping his psychopathic yearnings. He wants to kill more people. All right? Now, how do you deal with a guy like that?  You can't attack him because he has nukes. But you can strangle him economically. And I mean all the world banks. You don't do business with Moscow. Any bank that does, wipe off the face as far as sanctions are concerned. That's how you get him. And I had this conversation with Donald Trump.  I said, you can sanction him all day long. He doesn't care about his people. If they're eating grass, he doesn't care. But if you strangle the banks and he can't get his oil money moved and he can't get anything in, he'll make the deal. And I stand by that.  I think that's a sound analysis if you can get the banks to go along with it. We'll see. I mean, if there's one thing that's held consistent is that people keep doing what they need to do for their own benefit, regardless of what it means geopolitically. Trump is pretty damn powerful now. If you watch the NATO thing, he got all those NATO countries to kick 5% into defense when they were at 2%, except for Spain. And here's a little message for you, Spain. I'm not going there.  I'm not going to Spain, I don't go to Mexico either, okay? And I'm eliminating all the Spanish-speaking countries, and I speak a little Spanish, un poco, okay? But Spain is obnoxious. You're obnoxious, Spain, all right? Pony up. We protected your butt for decades. We, America. Pony up.  I know you don't care about Ukraine. I know you don't care about anything other than having dinner at 10 in the evening. I know that. But you better pony up. Bill O'Reilly, thank you very much for making your witness. I appreciate you. Appreciate you. Four minutes and 30 seconds. Those were the opinions of Bill O'Reilly. Yo te quiero, Espa\u00f1a. Yo te quiero.  Today, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a stern warning. She doesn't think there are Iranian regime sleeper cells here. She says she knows there are. Okay, that's not new. But I think that we have to start talking about what is new. That it's not homegrown terror meaning Islamists in our mists.  It's young men, primarily, who are disaffected, pissed off about inequality, pissed off about their lives, and open to fundamentalism. One of the leading counter-terror experts in the country, who he thinks we gotta be most afraid of. Today, A.G. Bondi was telling the Senate, sleeper cells from Iran, real deal.  Back to Iran, they have sleeper cells, we think, here?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1918.343, "text": "We have thus far arrested 1,500 illegal Iranians in our country.

Absolutely."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1933.602, "text": " I don't even know what that means. Just because you're here illegally doesn't mean that you're a terrorist, OK? But I also think it's a distraction. I don't think the big enemy is what we remember after 9-11. I think we are in a different phase of extremism here, where we have rank-and-file Americans who are angry, disaffected, and susceptible to all of the angry, extreme talk that's going on. And that's what we see in the recent spate of violence. They're not jihadis yelling about Allah.  They're yelling about wanting to destroy America, and they're American. Let's bring in former FBI and CIA counterterror official and expert, Mr. Phil Mudd. Good to see you, brother. Thank you. Who are you worried about and why? I would worry about Islamic extremists, and I don't believe there are many, if any, Iranian sleeper cells here. I would worry about domestic political violence conducted by people who look like you and me. And as a practitioner, I can give you evidence why.  Number one, there's 330 million Americans. How many of them are energized left and right by Democrats and Republicans by what they see happening in Congress versus how many might be energized by Iran? There's tens of millions of people in this country who are angry about politics. Number two, evidence.  How many times do you see political acts in this country, acts of violence committed by Middle Easterners versus people who are angry at a governor, at a mayor, at the U.S. Congress? And number three, you mentioned something really important that we forget, and that is messaging. The messaging from the left and the right here is sometimes verging on violence. That gives younger people especially who are emotional an opportunity cover to say, I want to go and do something about it. I worry about Americans who look like you and me.  who are energized by politics, Chris, and I think the evidence backs that up. The suggestion that it's getting worse here at home, the evidence of the Republican Party yielding to MAGA, which is without question fringe in its rhetoric, if not in its deliverables. And now we see no more Democratic Party. They have their own mirror image of MAGA that embraces a lot of fundamentalism, or at least gives excuses for it. What does that mean in the picture?  This is huge, this is underreported, and if I were in your shoes, which I hope never to be, if I were in your shoes, I'd talk about it more. Let me tell you why from my own life. Do you hear much more about ISIS? Do you hear much more about Al-Qaeda? That is not just an operational result. That is partly because the messaging from places like Syria and Iraq from ISIS, the messaging from places like Afghanistan from Al-Qaeda doesn't exist. So a 17-year-old who wants to learn about ISIS or Al-Qaeda has to look on YouTube.  If you want to see someone pushing, I wouldn't say violence, but getting pretty close to pushing to violence about right-wing and left-wing politics in this country, look to Congress. So messaging, I'm saying, is critical, whether it's the people I followed overseas, Islamic extremists, or whether it's extremists in this country. And the messaging in this country is far worse than it used to be, Chris. I mean, look, what is the main target of both fringes now? Destroy the system.  Destroy the elites. Destroy the establishment. And it's not that far off from something way back in 1789 called the French Revolution. Kill the rich. We are not that far from that right now.  People in this country do not realize what we have because they don't travel, and let me be blunt and get rude, they don't have passports. If you travel in the world I lived in, which was mostly the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, for 25 years, the line between autocracy, violence, and democracy is very thin. People here talk about the opposition party like they're the enemy because they don't recognize  When you say they're the enemy, the Democrats are the enemy or the Republicans, there might be one tenth of one percent of your followers who say, I'm going after the mayor. I'm going after the governor. I'm going after Congress. It's a numbers game in the world I lived in. And one tenth of one percent of the American population, if they are radicalized toward violence,  is a lot of people, Chris. You can't follow that many people with the FBI. Phil Mudd, I appreciate you. Thank you for perspective. It is amazing. As well-traveled as you are, you are still so profoundly unsophisticated. Four minutes and 15 seconds.

We're doing well in this country. IndyCar is coming back. NHRA. If you think about motorsports, IMSA, which is another sports car racing. I watch every lap of every race. A series that's part of the NASCAR family. And you oversee that as well.  Technically, yes. But I think, you know, for us, I think there's both domestic growth that we will experience over the next 20 years. And I think it's incredibly fertile ground for us to grow internationally.

And that's a style of racing that people like. And it's.  it's loud, it's, you know, it's a sensory experience, like it's a sensory overload when you go to a race. And for us, getting people to a race is critical, because if you go to a race, typically you'll become a fan, or at least have an appreciation for what it is. And so we just want people  to consider us in their consideration set, right? And so what we try to do is we try to meet them where they are. And we try to meet them where they are through content like Earnhardt on Amazon, which is the number one show  a week or so ago. The Garage 56 project and a show on Amazon called American Thunder or Netflix Full Speed. And they're meeting people where they are to have them understand or have an appreciation for the sport.

I was fully focused on our country and addressing the massive inequities in education in the US. And I wasn't thinking about the rest of the world at all. I was thinking about making Teach for America bigger and better. But there was something in the water in the rest of the world. And there was a particular year when we met 13 people from 13 different countries who were just determined  that something similar needed to happen in their countries. And they were looking for help. And that's ultimately what led to the launch of Teach for All as a network of independent, locally-led organizations all pursuing this kind of common mission and purpose that Teach for America is still pursuing as well."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 121.332, "text": "So explain to us how Teach for All works, how you designed it so your teachers and the organizations on the ground could have the biggest impact possible."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 129.875, "text": " So the big idea that brings everyone across Teach for All together is the idea that we need to, if we're going to address the fact that the circumstances of kids' birth predict their outcomes, it's a big, complex, systemic challenge, and we know that no one thing will solve this problem, that ultimately it will take many things, which means it will take  a lot of leadership at every level of the system, really around the whole ecosystem around kids. We need what we've come to call collective leadership, meaning enough people who are on a mission to make the system work for kids who are all working together.  exercising leadership in their individual positions as teachers, as school leaders, as school system leaders, in government, as social innovators, as advocates, but who are also stepping up from their individual pursuits and working together. And what Teach for America is doing, and Teach for India, Teach for Zimbabwe, Teach for Afghanistan, is working to develop that collective leadership. And we share an approach for developing that."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 193.012, "text": " And so tell us a little bit about how you take this idea, and it really seems like it all stems from this idea of collective leadership, and you make it happen.

Like, no one could have sat in India and drove change here in the US in our most marginalized communities. So the whole idea behind Teach for All's approach to scaling impact is to get behind local  social entrepreneurs who are on a mission to address that same issue in their countries and want to leverage this approach to enlisting promising leaders in their countries, people of all different academic backgrounds who, you know, maybe never thought they would teach. Maybe they're engineers and political science majors, but they have a track record of leadership and they enlist them in committing  just two years initially to teaching in the most under-resourced communities in their country and then they invest a lot in them. And those two years are so important for their students and so important for the leadership trajectories of those teachers. They're completely transformative.  They lead to a lifetime of leadership. So in fact, over the years, we've brought in actually 120,000 people, if you go way back to the beginning of Teach for America, who've committed just two years but have never left the work. 75% of them never leave the work after their two-year commitment to teach. They may leave the classroom, but they become  those leaders who are working throughout the system, who have the networks and relationships to work with each other and with many others in the system to affect the changes that we need to see."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 307.543, "text": "And you've really seen, and it sounds like the data really illustrates, how having those formative years in your early 20s, those teachers coming straight out of their own education in college, to have that experience impacts their whole life."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 321.711, "text": "It really does.  I have to say that one of the first experiences with Teach for All, I mean, we were seeing that long-term leadership effect at Teach for America. We were seeing that people would commit two years, and they would never leave. And at a very young age, they became this incredible leadership force for change. But when we started meeting people around the world, some of them thought because of the cultures of their countries, it would be very hard for people to stay full-time, long-term,  in kind of mission-related work, but they thought it'll still matter. They'll go into business and they'll be concerned civic leaders, right? But yet we saw the same results everywhere. Even the same data points, like all these different countries. You could be in Chile or Peru or Austria or India, and no matter what, you commit two years and 75% of you will never leave.  So we started doing research to understand what happens to people during those two years. And that research showed us just how significantly the two years influence values, mindsets. We saw people come to believe even more in the potential of the students and in the communities in which they're working, even more in their own ability to make a difference. And we saw them come to understand the nature of the problem and the solution very differently.  They came in thinking it was kind of a technical problem and solution and came out really understanding the complexity, the systemic nature, the adaptive nature of the solution. So what we saw through that research is they really become the leaders we need, right, who have such a sense of possibility, such a deep understanding of the issues and their solutions. And we also saw that their career trajectories and priorities completely shift."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 430.525, "text": " Yeah, that's phenomenal. Now, shifting from the teachers to the students, you've talked about how the students of today are going to be leading the world in just a couple of decades.

We put a time, like we said, in 25 years, what do we want to have be true? And because we framed the question that way, we started looking at, where will the world be in 25 years?  And it's, you know, we all read and we know, but there's something about those processes where you really get your head around just how much uncertainty there is, how much the economy is changing, how much the environment is degrading, you know, like the growing conflict in the world. And seeing that led us all to just collectively realize if we're not preparing today's students as the leaders we need to solve those complex problems,  There's no hope for reaching any of our aspirations for peace and sustainability and justice. So we really came together around a different vision than we had initially, which is around ensuring that all of our kids have the kind of education  and support an opportunity that it will take to shape a better future. So the implications of that for what we teach are very significant, because in addition to the kind of strong academic mastery, which is so crucial, we need that in order to have the kind of problem-solving, critical thinking skills, we also need to foster students' sense of agency, their awareness of the world, their empathy and sense of connectedness to people and planet.

I guess what we've seen historically, I mean, I think we are all trying to figure out, ultimately, what are the implications of AI? How will that shift every sector, including education? I guess what we've seen so far is that technology really amplifies what's there.  Technology in the hands of an extraordinary teacher is just incredibly accelerating of good things for kids, like it engages kids, they can solve bigger problems. I mean, it's incredible, right? Technology in a school where there's no sense of purpose and where you don't have engaging teachers becomes the world's biggest distraction.  And I have gone in whole schools and watched in every room where kids are just doing something completely different than what is supposed to be happening. So I think we need to be really careful about assuming that the technology will solve the problem. Because everything we've seen tells us that if we want to have  change in education, we want to have positive things happening for kids, we need to first think about the people in the puzzle and cultivate what we've come to call collective leadership. Cultivate the teachers and the school leaders and the whole system to be on a mission to ensure that all kids learn and to get kids on that same mission.

But I think what we've learned is that focusing on the technical practices of education, the curriculum, the technology, the getting the buildings open,  doesn't that it's it's important all those things are important but not sufficient we need to figure out how to foster the sense of purpose throughout a system so that all those things are done with intention and that's really where we've been lacking so we know that education can work and it we see whole classrooms whole schools whole communities that are making it happen for kids and wherever we see that  You have people on a mission towards ensuring students thrive.

It's that all the employers are banks and consulting firms just banging down our doors, asking us to commit just two years to work in their firms. So that is what ultimately led to this idea. Why aren't we being recruited as aggressively to commit just two years to teach in our country's most under-resourced communities? And I became very obsessed about this idea, both because I thought we'd channel all this  energy into the places that need it most, but also because I thought this would change the values of a generation, the priorities of a generation.

The firm intends to offer a target date fund with as much as 20% allocated to private assets by  the early part of next year, I'm told. The firm estimates that incorporating private equity and private credit into a 401k will deliver 15 percent more income over four decades, and that's before fees. Washington is entertaining this concept as well. This week, the House advanced a bill that broadens the so-called accredited investor status, which would allow more people to invest in private markets  through their 401k's and there have been recent reports about the Trump administration's expected plan to issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to study and propose rule changes involving private assets in retirement plans. Now there are still sizable, sizable hurdles among plan providers including high fees,  illiquidity, opacity, and litigation risk. BlackRock says in its paper that it's possible to offer exposure to private assets with a competitive fee structure that meets clients' needs on liquidity and transparency, and that a lot of the structuring would require products that are essentially built specifically for 401ks to address these concerns.  On the policy front, BlackRock says the biggest hurdle is that the litigation landscape, as more than half of the defined contribution plans with more than a billion dollars in assets, have been sued for excess fees, guys."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 106.285, "text": "Isn't this part of the bull case on a few names?

This is part of several of those decisions that we have been waiting for on this Thursday. Taking a live look here just outside of the Supreme Court where you can see several people are gathered there protesting. And I do want to read the latest report here from the Associated Press.  As it says this, the Supreme Court allowed states to cut off Medicaid money to Planned Parenthood in a ruling handed down Thursday amid a wider Republican-backed push to defund the country's biggest abortion provider. The case centers on funding for other health care services Planned Parenthood provides in South Carolina. But the ruling could have broader implications for Medicaid.  patients. Public health care money generally can't be used to pay for abortions. Medicaid patients go to Planned Parenthood for things like contraception, cancer screenings, and pregnancy testing, in part because it can be tough to find a doctor who takes the publicly funded insurance, according to the organization.  South Carolina's Republican governor says no taxpayer money should go to the organization. The budget bill backed by President Trump and Congress would also cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. That could force the closure of about 200 centers, most of them in states where abortion is legal.  according again to the organization. The governor, Henry McMaster, first moved to cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood in 2018, but was blocked in court after a lawsuit from a patient named Julie Edwards. Edwards wanted to keep going there for birth control because her diabetes makes pregnancy potentially dangerous. So she sued over a provision in Medicaid law that allows patients to choose their own qualified provider.  South Carolina, though, argued that patients should not be able to file those lawsuits. The state pointed to lower courts that have been swayed by similar arguments and allowed states such as Texas to block Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood.  Public health groups like the American Cancer Society, by contrast, sending court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that Medicaid patients have been able to enforce their right to choose their own doctor.

Explain that."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 104.269, "text": "Klineberger Yeah. Every couple of years, or every couple of months, I think you and I, or you and your clients, and me and my readers have the same kind of discussion. Some conflict breaks out, volatility comes to the markets, what are we supposed to do?  And of course, as a human being, this is very scary. As someone who cares about or has friends and family connected to those events, it's really distressing. And then you put your investor hat on and think about, what does history tell us here?  Now, obviously, every event is going to be slightly different, but history also tells us that the markets seem to eventually look past this. Even with what's going on in the Middle East right now, I think for as long as we've been alive, there's been some permutation of a Middle East conflict.  It's always been scary. There's always secondary effects in the financial markets, whether it's with oil prices or volatility and interest rates and currencies and all these sort of things. I think for traders who are trying to weave in and out of this, it's a big deal. You really should be paying close attention to every development here.  As someone who has to get somewhere in terms of retirement and long-term savings, or if you're saving for your kid's college fund or something, you have to wonder, what does five years out look like? What does ten years out look like? What does even three years out look like? When you see some of these reviews of various geopolitical events in the past, there are some conflicts that go on for a very long time and may or may not have a  a longer-term impact on the financial markets. But for the most part, the market hits tend to be very brief. I think I saw something from Deutsche Bank recently that reviewed something like 30 geopolitical events over the last 100 years, and from the beginning of the event that triggered the conflict to the bottom of the S&P 500, on average, the median stretch is about 15 days.

But sometimes we want to just ignore all this stuff, especially if we have 15, 20, 30 years until we actually have to begin selling these stocks. But I don't know if that's totally healthy.

So I think you have to be mindful of the fact that this stuff is going on in the world. And then you go back to the history and say, hey, the odds actually say people want de-escalation. People would rather not have violence out there. And that involves all parties.  And so as long as there are more people who would rather not have violence than want violence, I think there's some gravity toward de-escalation and a pullback in violent activity."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 357.543, "text": "So let's delve into the history of ... we'll deal with tariffs in a little bit.

And I was looking at the data, and apparently that was a pretty rough time, both in the oil markets and in the financial markets. And it was a tough time to be an investor going through all this volatility, because maybe this is it. Maybe this is the end of all that.  But then, it's not long after that you realize that's actually an incredible time to start putting money into Samro's 529. I wish my parents put money into a 529 plan at that time, but they didn't. But again, you just look backwards. If there's a more powerful force  than geopolitical tensions, it's going to be everyone's desire to want things to be better. And even from a business perspective, they want better technologies, they want things to be cheaper, they want things to be faster. And that force that's driving earnings and profits and productivity and the economy and employment and quality of life, standards of living and all this stuff, will continue to be the dominant force in the markets.

You mentioned oil earlier. In the 1990s, and especially in the 1970s, anytime we saw a Mideast tension, that always translated into higher oil prices, which then pushed into CPI inflation, driving it higher.  Are we in the same set of circumstances today? Ever since the new fracking technologies in the 2000s and the United States just cranking out oil for the past, I don't know, 10, 12 years at all-time record rates, does the U.S. lesser dependence on Middle Eastern oil make it  more or less likely that Middle East flare-ups are not going to be as inflationary as they once were."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 581.397, "text": "I think it's going to be not as inflationary as they once were.

And that's steadily been declining, and now it's closer to somewhere between 3% and 4%. That's amazing. Yeah, so energy, the direct spending on energy has shrunk significantly. And then past that,  The car you drive today is far more fuel efficient than the car you drove 20 years ago.

In every way, it's going to be, no, we're not going to have a ton of home shoring. We might have some at the margins. Everything happens at the margins, right? Some people who are saving 0.001% manufacturing in China might  figure out a way to move to the U.S. But for the most part, it's not going to be that much cheaper to move your manufacturing to the U.S. just because it was so expensive in China. You're going to move to Vietnam, you're going to move to Mexico, you're going to move to Indonesia and all these other places where it might be more expensive than China, for instance, but it's still going to be cheaper than the U.S. So I think that's one of the unintended consequences of that.  But as far as what you're saying about AI and machinery and robotics and all this stuff, yeah, absolutely. That's already happening. And so it's a question that I don't know if you can fight that. Unless there's a policy that decides that there's a limitation on how many robots you can have in your factories. We're not even talking about manufacturing anymore, or goods production. We're also talking about services.  Everyone in the service, AI has gotten to the point where it's not just affecting the assembly line, it's affecting people who go into an office and go to meetings and strategize for their marketing departments.

So this straightaway is almost 40 billion, and you're going to have... and there are so many other line items in the budget when you start peeling this stuff back. I mean, you look at the big consulting firms,  some of your listeners might not appreciate this, but the big four accounting firms and the strategy consultants won eight and a half billion pounds in national governmental contracts over the last five years alone. So the notion that there is no money to be saved is for the birds. Now it is also true  this country is almost three trillion in national debt. But the bottom line is the British economy is not growing. I mean, talk about 0.7%. That's less than the population is growing just from immigration. If we do not get the British economy growing meaningfully on a per capita basis, this country is headed  to an extremely bad place. The way we're going to do that is by cutting spending on things that are wasteful. We have to get our welfare bill under control and difficult conversations do have to be had about it. Of course there are some people who need benefits, of course that is true, but it has never been easier to get onto benefits. So we have to get the welfare bill per capita down to where it was back in 2019. That will free up a lot of money to reduce the tax burden on working people  And we also have to, by the way, be really honest that we need wealthy international job creators, wealth creators to be here. We don't need them fleeing. We want them here in the UK. That's a big part of what our policy announcement was today. If you talk to Sir Demis Hassibis at DeepMind, for example, you know, Jensen Huang from NVIDIA was talking about, he used the term Goldilocks situation for AI in the UK. We have a significant percentage of the world's finest AI engineers graduating from our universities, likewise in areas like biotech.  And then we also have to start manufacturing here again.

Chair Powell, thank you for your testimony today, and you have five minutes. Thank you. Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Warren, and other members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to present the Federal Reserve's Semi-Annual Monetary Policy Report. The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on achieving our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices for the benefit of the American people.  Despite elevated uncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. The unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has come down a great deal, but has been running somewhat above our 2% longer run objective. And we are attentive to the risks to both sides of our dual mandate. I will review the current economic situation before turning to monetary policy.  Incoming data suggests that the economy remains solid. Following growth of 2.5% last year, GDP was reported to have edged down in the first quarter, reflecting swings in net exports that were driven by businesses bringing in imports ahead of potential tariffs. This unusual swing has complicated GDP measurement. Private domestic final purchases, or PDFP, which excludes net exports, inventory investment, and government spending, grew at a solid 2.5% rate.  Within PDFP, growth of consumer spending moderated while investment in equipment and intangibles rebounded from weakness in the fourth quarter. Surveys of households and businesses, however, report a decline in sentiment over recent months and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook, largely reflecting trade policy concerns. It remains to be seen how these developments might affect future spending and investment.  In the labor market, conditions have remained solid. Payroll job gains averaged a moderate $124,000 per month in the first five months of the year. The unemployment rate at 4.2% in May remains low and has stayed in a narrow range for the past year. Wage growth has continued to moderate while still outpacing inflation.  Overall, a wide set of indicators suggest that conditions in the labor market are broadly in balance and consistent with maximum employment. The labor market is not a source of significant inflationary pressures. The strong labor market conditions in recent years have helped narrow longstanding disparities in employment and earnings across demographic groups.  Inflation has eased significantly from its highs in mid-2022, but remains somewhat elevated relative to our 2% longer-run goal. Estimates based on the Consumer Price Index and other data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.3% over the 12 months ending in May and that, excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.6%.  Near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up over recent months, as reflected in both market and survey-based measures. Respondents to surveys of consumers, businesses, and professional forecasters point to tariffs as a driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.  Our monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. With the labor market at or near maximum employment and inflation remaining somewhat elevated, the Federal Open Market Committee has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25% to 4.5% since the beginning of the year.  We have also continued to reduce our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and, beginning in April, further slowed the pace of this decline to facilitate a smooth transition to ample reserve balances. We will continue to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.  Policy changes continue to evolve, and their effects on the economy remain uncertain. The effects of tariffs will depend, among other things, on their ultimate level. Expectations of that level, and thus of the related economic effects, reached a peak in April and have since declined.  Even so, increases in tariffs this year are likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity. The effects on inflation could be short-lived, reflecting a one-time shift in the price level. It is also possible that the inflationary effects could instead be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the tariff effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully into prices, and ultimately on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.  The FOMC's obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time increase in the price level from becoming an ongoing inflation problem. As we act to meet that obligation, we will balance our maximum employment and price stability mandates, keeping in mind that without price stability, we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans.  For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy rate. To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. Thank you. I look forward to your questions."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

Under the Biden administration, the United States was flooded with tens of millions of illegal immigrants that used dozens of visa programs to finesse their way into our great nation. In response to this invasion, President Trump signed an executive order simply returning immigration law back to the standards of July 19, 2021, which restores and enhances all screening of foreign nationals, especially those who are considered to be a high risk to this country.  In order to secure the homeland, which was about 77 million Americans voted for, we must do more than just finish the wall, fund CBP, and support ISIS's lawful deportation operations. We must also reform visa programs which have been used to usurp federal immigration law.  We were told post 9-11 that we were going to fight in Afghanistan and that we had to fight in Iraq. And why? Because if we didn't fight the enemy there, then we're going to have to fight them here in our own country now. And now because of the failures of the Democratic Party's policies, they are now in our homeland.  And how do we know? Because 382 citizens who are matches on the terror watch list were encountered at the southern border and 99 of those were released into the United States from 2001 to 2023. Unacceptable. The Democrat party under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, Alejandro Mayorkas and numerous other dark money groups and NGOs made it their mission to flood this country with tens of millions of unvetted immigrants and people  who wish to do us harm. Terrorists like Egyptian national Mohammed Sabri Solomon, who used a homemade flamethrower and Molotov cocktails in Boulder, Colorado, to attack pro-Israel demonstrators who were advocating for the release of hostages.  this man who was admitted into the US in 2022 on a tourist visa and was then given work authorization in 2023 by, yes, you guessed it, the Biden administration, and had been posting pro-Muslim Brotherhood propaganda on his Facebook page for more than a decade.

Just arrived last night back from NATO, two days apart from my battle buddy, so it's good to see him this morning. Good to see you, Mr. Chairman. You too, sir. Where there was a historic outcome. I want to start with that real quick. I think there's so much news, so many things happening that oftentimes  Big, momentous moments get missed. What President Trump accomplished in NATO yesterday was game-changing and historic. A shift in burden-sharing to European responsibility in NATO that most would have said was impossible at the beginning of his term. But he said NATO needs to pay up. They started in the first term, and here in his second term, we've accelerated that.  32 NATO countries committed to spending 5% of their GDP on defense, on actually investing in the NATO alliance. So I hope with all the ink spilled, all of your outlets find the time to properly recognize this historic change in continental security that other presidents tried to do, other presidents talked about. President Trump accomplished it. It's a huge deal.  I see we're here this morning because in hunting for scandals all the time, in trying to find wedges and spin stories, this press corps and the press corps miss historic moments. You miss historic moments like 5% at NATO, which when you hear, I was in the closed door briefing. I wish there could have been cameras in there. When you heard the prime ministers and presidents of other countries, to a man and to a woman, looking at President Trump and saying, this never could have happened.  Never would have happened. Seemed impossible five years ago, two years ago, eight years ago. But here we are because of your leadership. If you ask them the question,  I bet they'd say the same thing. But searching for scandals, you miss historic moments like recruiting at the Pentagon, historic levels in the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. Yeah, maybe there'll be a little mention here or there. But because it was under President Trump's leadership, because it was because because Americans are responding to him as commander in chief.  The press corps doesn't want to write about it. Or bring us to the topic of the moment, the highly successful strikes in Iran. Let me read the bottom line here. President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history  And it was a resounding success, resulting in a ceasefire agreement and the end of the 12-day war. There's been a lot of discussion about what happened and what didn't happen. Step back for a second. Because of decisive military action, President Trump created the conditions to end the war, decimating, choose your word, obliterating, destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities.  I want to read some of the assessments that have been provided, because whether it's fake news, CNN, MSNBC, or the New York Times, there's been fawning coverage of a preliminary assessment. I haven't had a chance to read it. Every outlet has breathlessly reported on a preliminary assessment from DIA. I'm looking at it right now. Again, it was preliminary, a day and a half after the actual strike.  When it admits itself in writing that it requires weeks to accumulate the necessary data to make such an assessment, it's preliminary. It points out that it's not been coordinated with the intelligence community at all. There's low confidence in this particular report. There's, it says in the report, there are gaps in the information. It says in the report, multiple linchpin assumptions are what this assessment, a linchpin assumption, you know what that is? That means your entire premise is predicated on a linchpin. If you're wrong, everything else is wrong.  And yet, still, this report acknowledges it's likely severe damage. Again, this is preliminary, but leaked because someone had an agenda to try to muddy the waters and make it look like this historic strike wasn't successful. I'm going to get to the chairman in a moment because he's going to lay out the particulars for you based on his professional military experience. But here's what other folks are saying. The DIA, they put that report out.  says this is a preliminary low-confidence report and will continue to be refined as additional intelligence becomes available. How about the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission? The devastating U.S. strikes on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable. Have any of these quotes made their way into The New York Times or The Washington Post? MSNBC? CNN?  Any of these quotes? How about this one? This is a new one from the UN, the United Nations. No friend of the United States or certainly Israel often. Here's the head of the UN Atomic Energy Agency this morning, Rafael Grossi. U.S. and Israeli strikes caused enormous damage to Iran's nuclear sites. Don't take my word for it. How about the IDF's chief of staff?  I can say here that the assessment is that we significantly damaged the nuclear program, setting it back by years. I repeat, years. The Iranian foreign minister, the spokesman, our nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure. I'm sure that's an understatement.  John Radcliffe, the director of the CIA, putting out a statement just last night. CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's nuclear program has been severely damaged by recent targeted strikes. This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable, very different than preliminary assessment, with low confidence. He's saying, historically reliable and accurate source and method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed.  and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years. CIA continues to collect additional reliably sourced information to keep appropriate decision makers fully informed. How about DNI Tulsi Gabbard yesterday? She writes, and I quote, new intelligence confirms what POTUS has stated numerous times. Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed.  Institute for Science and International Security President David Albright. Overall, Israel and US attacks have effectively destroyed Iran's centrifuge enrichment program. Time and time again, I can go down the list. Those that understand, those that see, those that do proper assessments recognize that what the United States military did was historic. And again, before I pass it to the chairman,  Because you, and I mean specifically you the press, specifically you the press corps, because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump, because you want him not to be successful so bad,  You have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. Maybe the way the Trump administration has represented them isn't true. So let's take half-truths, spun information, leaked information, and then spin it. Spin it in every way we can to try to cause doubt and manipulate the public mind over whether or not our brave pilots  were successful. How many stories have been written about how hard it is to, I don't know, fly a plane for 36 hours?  Has MSNBC done that story? Has Fox? Have we done the story how hard that is? Have we done it two or three times so that American people understand? How about how difficult it is to shoot a drone from an F-15 or 16 or F-22 or F-35? Or what it's like to man a Patriot battery? Or how hard it is to refuel midair? Giving the American people an understanding of how complex and sophisticated this mission really was.  There are so many aspects of what our brave men and women did that, because of the hatred of this press corps, are undermined because people are trying to leak and spin that it wasn't successful. It's irresponsible.  Folks in this room are privy to that information because of the proximity here in the Pentagon. It's an important responsibility. And time and time again, classified information is leaked or peddled for political purposes to try to make the president look bad. And what's really happening is you're undermining the success of incredible B-2 pilots and incredible F-35 pilots and incredible refuelers and incredible air defenders who accomplished their mission.  set back a nuclear program in ways that other presidents would have dreamed. How about we celebrate that? How about we talk about how special America is, that only we have these capabilities? I think it's too much to ask, unfortunately, for the fake news. So we're used to that. But we also have an opportunity to stand at the podium and read the truth of what's really happening. And the reality is you want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated, choose your word.  This was an historically successful attack, and we should celebrate it as Americans. And it gives us a chance to have peace, a chance to have a deal, and an opportunity to prevent a nuclear Iran, which is something President Trump talked about for 20 years and no other presidents had the courage to actually do. So, with that, I want to hand it over to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. They've done tactical analysis on this, not just on the strike, but also on our patriot defenders and all you need. And, Mr. Chairman, I'll hand it over to you."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

They deported a four-year-old American citizen child with cancer whose parents had no criminal record, and we still don't know why.

I mean, one, obviously, the nuke program. We want a verifiable ability to make sure that they don't develop a nuclear weapons program, get all tactical about enriched uranium.

Anything over that,  Really, the only legitimate purpose would be a nuclear weapon. So how do we make sure they don't go over that amount? Obviously, the safest way is to not let them enrich at all. Or in some cases, deals have been made for countries that want to develop nuclear power, where it's enriched at a different country and then brought in. That's number one. Number two, Iran's support for terrorist proxies in the region, they have been a major destabilizing influence in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq.  with Hamas in Yemen. You know, how can we reduce that influence? Third, their missile program, the ballistic missiles that they've developed threaten their neighbors.

And, of course, that's why Trump and Hegseth are running around blathering about how their nuclear program has been completely obliterated, even though anyone will tell you that is not the case. So I don't think we got a lot for it. Now, the debate on how it affects the negotiation, I'm kind of 50-50 on. On the one hand, you could say, yes, Iran is now knocked back on their heels. They're fearful. They're going to be more likely to come to the table.  Because of that, frankly, that was caused a heck of a lot more by what Israel has done, which I support. Israel was directly threatened by Iran. It was clearly an imminent threat to Israel. So Israel attacking their missile sites, they had been already attacked by Iran. Israel also degraded Hezbollah and Hamas. So that, I think, has had more to do with our bombing campaign, but does our action force  Iran to think, God, we better make a deal because they could hit us again, or does it make them think, what's the point in negotiating?

That's why.  So you bring the chairman here who's not involved in politics. He didn't do politics. That's my lane to understand and translate and talk about those types of things.

But we don't really know how much the Iranian program has been degraded. And the Secretary's not wrong. The DIA report was preliminary.  based on some, you know, measurements of exactly how far these bombs could go, how far below the surface we knew that the centrifuges were. But again, it's not the only sight that Iran had. It's not their only ability to build centrifuges. And crucially, the highly enriched uranium, uranium rich at 60 percent, wasn't at Fordow.  And, you know, they had considerable advance notice of the attack on Isfahan, I think is the name of the place where the material was, so it had been moved. So the point is, whatever sort of semantic debate we want to get into over how much the Iranian nuclear program has been degraded, it has not been eliminated. And it's highly irresponsible of both the President and the Secretary of Defense to come out and say it's been obliterated. All gone, all done, we're done here. That is wrong.  Or at an absolute minimum, not no. We still have a problem with an Iranian nuclear program. It is a weakened Iranian nuclear program, and it's really a technical debate. How weakened? How long is it going to take them? How many centrifuges do they have left? How much 60 percent uranium do they have left? How long would it take them to get back up? Not that long is the bottom line.

In the days preceding the attack against Fordow, the Iranians attempted to cover the shafts with concrete to try to prevent an attack.  I won't share the specific dimensions of the concrete cap, but you should know that we know what the dimensions of those concrete caps were. The planners had to account for this. They accounted for everything. The cap was forcibly removed by the first weapon, and the main shaft was uncovered.  Weapons 2, 3, 4, 5 were tasked to enter the main shaft, move down into the complex at greater than 1,000 feet per second, and explode in the mission space.  Weapon number six was designed on each side, so there were six on each side. Weapons number six was designed as a flex weapon to allow us to cover if one of the preceding jets or one of the preceding weapons did not work.  The video I'm about to show you is a culmination of over 15 years of development and testing. As I said, hundreds of test shots on various models. This is one weapon. So if you take a view of this as five additionals, you'll get a sense of what this looks like. Hopefully you can see it and there's not too much reflection.  Tom runs our videos out there. We'll run it at full speed so you can see it and then go back through it. Go ahead, Tom.  Keep it going for a minute. You'll see inside the mission space.  Unlike a normal surface bomb, you won't see an impact crater because they're designed to deeply bury and then function. I know there's been a lot of questions about that. All six weapons at each vent at Fordow went exactly where they were intended to go. A bomb has three effects that causes damage, blast, fragmentation, and overpressure.  In this case, the primary kill mechanism in the mission space was a mix of overpressure and blast ripping through the open tunnels and destroying critical hardware. The majority of the damage we assessed based on our extensive modeling was a blast layer combined with the impulse extending from the shock. Imagine what this looks like six times over.  A point that I want to make here, the Joint Force does not do BDA. By design, we don't grade our own homework. The intelligence community does. But here's what we know following the attacks and the strikes on Fordow. First, that the weapons were built, tested, and loaded properly. Two, the weapons were released on speed and on parameters.  Three, the weapons all guided to their intended targets and to their intended aim points."}], "keywords": [], "summary": {"Aaron Gilchrist": null, "Adam": null, "Adrian Hallmark": null, "Adrienne Broadus": null, "Alex Haley": null, "Alex Steele": null, "Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez": null, "Andrea Mitchell": null, "Andrew Budd": null, "Andy Mack": null, "Ayesha Hasni": null, "Barack Obama": null, "Barry McCaffrey": null, "Benjamin Rad": null, "Bernie_Sanders": null, "Betty Shabazz": null, "Bill Campbell": null, "Bill_Clinton": null, "Bloomberg_Politics_contributors_Jeannie_Shanzano_and_Rick_Davis": null, "Brett Villakovich": null, "Brian Katulis": null, "Burgess Everett": null, "CHAD PERGRAM": null, "Caroline Levitt": null, "Caroline_Hepke": null, "Cat_Toombs": null, "Charlamagne": null, "Chuck Schumer": null, "Clarence Thomas": null, "Courtney Cubias": null, "Courtney Kubie": null, "Courtney Kuby": null, "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth": null, "Deirdre Bosa": null, "Dennis Quaid": null, "Department of Homeland Security": null, "Dick Durbin": null, "Donald Trump": null, "Donald_Trump": null, "Doug Krisner": null, "Dr. Drew Pinsky": null, "Dr. John Torres": null, "E.J.

I want to start with that real quick. I think there's so much news, so many things happening that oftentimes  Big, momentous moments get missed. What President Trump accomplished in NATO yesterday was game-changing and historic. A shift in burden-sharing to European responsibility in NATO that most would have said was impossible at the beginning of his term. But he said NATO needs to pay up. They started in the first term, and here in his second term, we've accelerated that.  32 NATO countries committed to spending 5% of their GDP on defense, on actually investing in the NATO alliance. So I hope with all the ink spilled, all of your outlets find the time to properly recognize this historic change in continental security that other presidents tried to do, other presidents talked about. President Trump accomplished it. It's a huge deal.  I see we're here this morning because in hunting for scandals all the time, in trying to find wedges and spin stories, this press corps and the press corps miss historic moments. You miss historic moments like 5% at NATO, which when you hear, I was in the closed-door briefing. I wish there could have been cameras in there. When you heard the prime ministers and presidents of other countries, to a man and to a woman, looking at President Trump and saying, this never could have happened.  Never would have happened. Seemed impossible five years ago, two years ago, eight years ago. But here we are because of your leadership. If you ask them the question,  I bet they'd say the same thing. But searching for scandals, you miss historic moments, like recruiting at the Pentagon. Historic levels in the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. Yeah, maybe there'll be a little mention here or there, but because it was under President Trump's leadership, because it was because Americans are responding to him as Commander-in-Chief, the press corps doesn't want to write about it.  Or bring us to the topic of the moment, the highly successful strikes in Iran. Let me read the bottom line here. President Trump directed the most complex and secretive military operation in history.  And it was a resounding success, resulting in a ceasefire agreement and the end of the 12-day war. There's been a lot of discussion about what happened and what didn't happen. Step back for a second. Because of decisive military action, President Trump created the conditions to end the war, decimating, choose your word, obliterating, destroying Iran's nuclear capabilities.  I want to read some of the assessments that have been provided, because whether it's fake news, CNN, MSNBC, or the New York Times, there's been fawning coverage of a preliminary assessment. I haven't had a chance to read it. Every outlet has breathlessly reported on a preliminary assessment from DIA. I'm looking at it right now. Again, it was preliminary, a day and a half after the actual strike.  When it admits itself in writing that it requires weeks to accumulate the necessary data to make such an assessment, it's preliminary, it points out that it's not been coordinated with the intelligence community at all. There's low confidence in this particular report. It says in the report there are gaps in the information. It says in the report multiple linchpin assumptions are what this assessment, a linchpin assumption, you know what that is? That means your entire premise is predicated on a linchpin. If you're wrong, everything else is wrong.  And yet, still, this report acknowledges it's likely severe damage. Again, this is preliminary. But leaked because someone had an agenda to try to muddy the waters and make it look like this historic strike wasn't successful. I'm going to get to the chairman in a moment because he's going to lay out the particulars for you based on his professional military experience. But here's what other folks are saying. The DIA, they put that report out.  says this is a preliminary low-confidence report and will continue to be refined as additional intelligence becomes available. How about the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission? The devastating U.S. strikes on Fordow destroyed the site's critical infrastructure and rendered the enrichment facility inoperable. Have any of these quotes made their way into The New York Times or The Washington Post? MSNBC? CNN?  Any of these quotes? How about this one? This is a new one from the UN, the United Nations. No friend of the United States or certainly Israel often. Here's the head of the UN Atomic Energy Agency this morning, Rafael Grossi. U.S. and Israeli strikes caused enormous damage to Iran's nuclear sites. Don't take my word for it. How about the IDF's chief of staff?  I can say here that the assessment is that we significantly damaged the nuclear program, setting it back by years. I repeat, years. The Iranian foreign minister, the spokesman, our nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure. I'm sure that's an understatement.  John Radcliffe, the director of the CIA, putting out a statement just last night. CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's nuclear program has been severely damaged by recent targeted strikes. This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable, very different than preliminary assessment with low confidence, he's saying historically reliable and accurate source and method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed.  and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years. CIA continues to collect additional reliably sourced information to keep appropriate decision makers fully informed. How about DNI Tulsi Gabbard yesterday? She writes, and I quote, new intelligence confirms what POTUS has stated numerous times. Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed.  Institute for Science and International Security President David Albright. Overall, Israel and US attacks have effectively destroyed Iran's centrifuge enrichment program. Time and time again, I can go down the list. Those that understand, those that see, those that do proper assessments recognize that what the United States military did was historic. And again, before I pass it to the chairman,  Because you, and I mean specifically you, the press, specifically you, the press corps, because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump, because you want him not to be successful so bad,  You have to cheer against the efficacy of these strikes. You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. Maybe the way the Trump administration has represented them isn't true. So let's take half-truths, spun information, leaked information, and then spin it. Spin it in every way we can to try to cause doubt and manipulate the public mind over whether or not our brave pilots  were successful. How many stories have been written about how hard it is to, I don't know, fly a plane for 36 hours?  Has MSNBC done that story? Has Fox? Have we done the story how hard that is? Have we done it two or three times so that American people understand? How about how difficult it is to shoot a drone from an F-15 or 16 or F-22 or F-35? Or what it's like to man a Patriot battery? Or how hard it is to refuel midair? Giving the American people an understanding of how complex and sophisticated this mission really was.  There are so many aspects of what our brave men and women did that, because of the hatred of this press corps, are undermined because people are trying to leak and spin that it wasn't successful. It's irresponsible. And folks in this room,  are privy to that information because of the proximity here in the Pentagon. It's an important responsibility. And time and time again, classified information is leaked or peddled for political purposes to try to make the President look bad. And what's really happening is you're undermining the success of incredible B-2 pilots and incredible F-35 pilots and incredible refuelers and incredible air defenders who accomplished their mission  set back a nuclear program in ways that other presidents would have dreamed. How about we celebrate that? How about we talk about how special America is, that only we have these capabilities? I think it's too much to ask, unfortunately, for the fake news. So we're used to that. But we also have an opportunity to stand at the podium and read the truth of what's really happening. And the reality is you want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated, choose your word.  This was a historically successful attack, and we should celebrate it as Americans. And it gives us a chance to have peace, a chance to have a deal, and an opportunity to prevent a nuclear Iran, which is something President Trump talked about for 20 years and no other presidents had the courage to actually do.  So with that, I want to hand it over to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. They've done technical analysis on this, not just on the strike, but also on our Patriot defenders and all you need. And Mr. Chairman, I'll hand it over to you."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade"], "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 603.831, "text": "Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. And good morning. And all of you, thank you for thank you for being here.  As a follow-up to my comments on Sunday's press conference, I wanted to give you a few updates this morning on something I'm honored to do as a chairman, and that's a chance to get to talk about some of our service members and the incredible things that they do on behalf of our nation. And I apologize ahead of time for the length and the detail.  Today, I'm going to brief you on a couple things. First, I'm going to talk about our air defenders at Al Udeid in Qatar and their actions on Monday. Then I'm going to walk you through a little bit about the academics that went into the attack against Fordow, the massive ordnance penetrator weapon, and we're going to show a video that highlights the effects that that weapon has. Of course, nobody was down inside the target, so we don't have video from the target.  First, on Monday, as the President has stated, on Monday morning, we began to receive indications and warnings that Iran intended to attack U.S. bases in the region. That morning, building on the work that CENTCOM Commander Eric Carrillo had done, and on the orders of the President, at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and around the region, we assumed a minimum force posture.  Most folks had moved off the base to extend the security perimeter out away from what we assessed might be a target zone, except for a very few Army soldiers at Al Udeid.  At that point, only two Patriot batteries remained on base, roughly 44 American soldiers responsible for defending the entire base, to include CENTCOM's forward headquarters in the Middle East, an entire air base, and all the U.S. forces there.  The oldest soldier was a 28-year-old captain. The youngest was a 21-year-old private who'd been in the military for less than two years. So let's put ourselves out there for a second. Imagine you're that young first lieutenant. You're 25 or 26 years old, and you've been assigned as the tactical director inside the command and control element.  You, at that age, are the sole person responsible to defend this base. Listening next to you is your early warning operator whose job is to notify you of imminent attack. There's five people inside a vehicle and five people outside of a vehicle around these, a total of, as I said, 44.  By the way, you've sat in the Middle East for years, deployed over and over again, extended multiple times, always being prepared but unsure of when that particular day will come that you must execute your mission and not fail at doing it. In this case, these Patriot crews were deployed from Korea and Japan as part of our U.S. forces there.  to ensure that we had the most capable missiles in the CENTCOM area of responsibility.  As the day continues, you start to hear more and more chatter in the information space about an impending attack. And as the sun starts to set in the west, you get orders from your higher headquarters to make sure that your missile batteries are pointed to the north. There are just a few other teammates. It's hot, you're getting nervous, and you expect an attack.  Outside of those Patriot vehicles, your hot crew, which is one NCO and four additional soldiers, turns a key and relinquishes control of those missiles to that young lieutenant inside the vehicle, and you wait. You know that you're going to have approximately two minutes, 120 seconds to either succeed  or fail. And then at approximately 12.30 p.m. on Monday, that's 7.30 p.m. in Qatar, as the sun sets in the West, Iran attacks.  As the targets were detected, round after round of Patriot missiles are ejected from their canisters by an initial launch charge. Then the main solid rocket motor ignites. You can feel this in your body if you've ever been around a Patriot taking a shot. And round after round goes out and guides against those missiles coming inbound.  We believe that this is the largest single Patriot engagement in U.S. military history, and we were joined in this engagement by the Qatari Patriot crews.  I'm not going to tell you how many rounds were shot, but it was a bunch because of classified purposes. And we're aware that there's reports of something getting through. What we do know is there was a lot of metal flying around between attacking missiles being hit by Patriots, boosters from attacking missiles being hit by Patriots.  The Patriots themselves flying around and the debris from those Patriots hitting the ground, there was a lot of metal flying around. And yet our U.S. Air Defenders had only seconds to make complex decisions with strategic impact. These awesome humans, along with their Qatari brothers and sisters in arms,  stood between a salvo of Iranian missiles and the safety of value deed. They are the unsung heroes of the 21st century United States Army. And I know a lot of you have seen the videos online and the excitement as those patriots departed their launchers and went up and guided.  This really demonstrates the combat capability and capacity of our Army Air Defenders. Simply stated, they absolutely crushed it. If you'd flip this over, thanks. Let me next move to a walkthrough of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator weapon and share a little bit about the planners who did this and their work on the weapon.  First, let me set the stage for you. There's an organization in the US called the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA. DTRA does a lot of things for our nation, but DTRA is the world's leading expert on deeply buried underground targets. In 2009, a Defense Threat Reduction Agency officer was brought into a vault at an undisclosed location  and briefed on something going on in Iran. For security purposes, I'm not going to share his name. He was shown some photos and some highly classified intelligence of what looked like a major construction project in the mountains of Iran. He was tasked to study this facility, work with the intelligence community to understand it, and he was soon joined by an additional teammate.  For more than 15 years, this officer and his teammate lived and breathed this single target, Fordow, a critical element of Iran's covert nuclear weapons program. He studied the geology. He watched the Iranians dig it out. He watched the construction, the weather, the discard material, the geology, the construction materials.  where the materials came from. He looked at the vent shaft, the exhaust shaft, the electrical systems, the environmental control systems, every nook, every crater, every piece of equipment going in and every piece of equipment going out. They literally dreamed about this target at night when they slept. They thought about it driving back and forth to work.  And they knew from the very first days what this was for. You do not build a multi-layered underground bunker complex with centrifuges and other equipment in a mountain for any peaceful purpose.  They weren't able to discuss this with their family, their wives, their kids, their friends, but they just kept grinding it out. And along the way, they realized we did not have a weapon that could adequately strike and kill this target. So they began a journey to work with industry and other tacticians to develop the GBU-57. They tested it over and over again, tried different options, tried more after that.  They accomplished hundreds of test shots and dropped many full-scale weapons against extremely realistic targets for a single purpose, kill this target at the time and place of our nation's choosing.  And then, on a day in June of 2025, more than 15 years after they started their life's work, the phone rang and the President of the United States ordered the B-2 force that you've supported to go strike and kill this target. Yesterday, I had the incredible honor and privilege of spending time with these two Defense Threat Reduction Agency officers who've given so much. One of them said, quote, I can't even get my head around this. My heart is so filled  With the pride of being a part of this team, I am so honored to be a part of this. To you both, thank you, and thank you to your families. Operation Midnight Hammer was the culmination of those 15 years of incredible work, the air crews, the tanker crews, the weapons crews that built the weapons, the load crews that loaded it. Before I run through this video today, I want to talk a little bit about weaponeering and what goes into an attack.  Weaponeering is the science of evaluating a target. I mentioned all of those factors before that these two DTRA officers had thought about. Ultimately, weaponeering is determining the right weapon and fuse combination to achieve the desired effects and maximum destruction against a target.  In the case of Fordeaux, the DITRA team understood with a high degree of confidence the elements of the target required to kill its functions, and the weapons were designed, planned, and delivered to ensure that they achieved the effects in the mission space. By the way,  In the beginning of its development, we had so many PhDs working on the MOP program, doing modeling and simulation, that we were quietly and in a secret way the biggest users of supercomputer hours within the United States of America. So let me talk about  Let me talk about the graphic a little bit. And the GBU-57, which all of you I know know, is a 30,000-pound weapon dropped only by the B-2. It's comprised of steel, explosive, and a fuse programmed bespokely each weapon to achieve a particular effect  inside the target. Each weapon had a unique desired impact angle, arrival, final heading, and a fuse setting. The fuse is effectively what tells the bomb when to function. A longer delay in a fuse, the deeper the weapon will penetrate and drive into the target.  So on Fordow, in June of 2008, you can see these three holes. Depicted here is the main exhaust shaft with two additional ventilation shafts on either side. The United States decided to strike these two ventilation shafts, seen here on the main graphic, as the primary point of entry into the mission space. In the days preceding the attack against Fordow, the Iranians attempted to cover the shafts  with concrete to try to prevent an attack. I won't share the specific dimensions of the concrete cap, but you should know that we know what the dimensions of those concrete caps were. The planners had to account for this. They accounted for everything. The cap was forcibly removed by the first weapon, and the main shaft was uncovered.  Weapons 2, 3, 4, 5 were tasked to enter the main shaft, move down into the complex at greater than 1,000 feet per second, and explode in the mission space. Weapon number 6 was designed on each side. So there were six on each side. Weapons number 6 was designed as a flex weapon to allow us to cover if one of the preceding jets  or one of the preceding weapons did not work. The video I'm about to show you is a culmination of over 15 years of development and testing. As I said, hundreds of test shots on various models. This is one weapon. So if you take a view of this as five additionals, you'll get a sense of what this looks like.  Hopefully you can see it and there's not too much reflection. Tom runs our videos out there. We'll run it at full speed so you can see it and then go back through it. Go ahead, Tom.  Keep it going for a minute. You'll see inside the mission space.  Unlike a normal surface bomb, you won't see an impact crater because they're designed to deeply bury and then function. I know there's been a lot of questions about that. All six weapons at each vent at Fordow went exactly where they were intended to go. A bomb has three effects that causes damage, blast, fragmentation, and overpressure.  In this case, the primary kill mechanism in the mission space was a mix of overpressure and blast ripping through the open tunnels and destroying critical hardware. The majority of the damage we assessed based on our extensive modeling was a blast layer combined with the impulse extending from the shock. Imagine what this looks like six times over.  A point that I want to make here, the Joint Force does not do BDA. By design, we don't grade our own homework. The intelligence community does. But here's what we know following the attacks and the strikes on Fordow. First, that the weapons were built, tested, and loaded properly.  Two, the weapons were released on speed and on parameters. Three, the weapons all guided to their intended targets and to their intended aim points.  Four, the weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded. And we know this through other means, intelligence means that we have that we're visibly able to see them. And we know that the trailing jets saw the first weapons function and the pilots stated, quote, this was the brightest explosion that I've ever seen. It literally looked like daylight.  Let me now turn to the bomber crews themselves, give you a few details about them. The crews that attacked Fordeaux were from the active duty Air Force and the Missouri Air National Guard. The crews ranked from captain to colonel and most were graduates of the Air Force Weapons School headquartered at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. I will state for the record that there is no beach volleyball  or football at the Air Force Weapon School. They were male and female aviators on this mission, and a crew member told me when I talked to them on video the other day that this felt like the Super Bowl, the thousands of scientists, airmen, and maintainers all coming together. One last story about people.  When the crews went to work on Friday, they kissed their loved ones goodbye, not knowing when or if they'd be home. Late on Saturday night, their families became aware of what was happening. And on Sunday, when those jets returned from Whiteman, their families were there. Flags flying and tears flowing. I have chills literally talking about this.  The jets rejoined into a formation of four airplanes followed by a formation of three and came up overhead Whiteman proudly in the traffic pattern pitching out to land right over the base and landing to the incredible cheers of their families who sacrifice and serve right alongside their family members. Like I said, there were a lot of flags and a lot of tears.  One commander told me, this is a moment in the lives of our families that they will never forget. That, my friends, is what America's joint force does. We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we test, we evaluate every single day.  And when the call comes to deliver, we do so. I could not be more proud standing up here today of our joint force. I'm filled with gratitude that I get to tell their story. And as we stand here right now, our forces remain on a high state of readiness in the region, prepared to defend themselves. And one last thing. Our adversaries around the world should know that there are other  DITRA team members out there studying targets for the same amount of time, and we'll continue to do so. Thank you very much. I apologize for the length. I look forward to your questions."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 1731.679, "text": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just thank you, by the way, for that extensive work, the lay down. I mean, even you have that laser pointer. Yes, sir.  Thank you, squaring me away as always. I mean, even in just the public reporting, if you see the post-strike shaft of the three holes, the vast majority, and fairly so, the vast majority of speculation has been those are the three strike points. When in actuality, what you realize is these are the vents, these are the caps, the first munition took the cap off, and the other five went down the center hole.  which, if you're planning the target, you would want it to be the direct one going to the bottom. These are the types of things that go into the planning for a strike that we wouldn't, the Pentagon would not expect the press corps, the American people, to initially understand, so laying this information out is helpful. But it's also why we asked for a beat.  for a moment, for a day or two, the opportunity to tell that story. Because as the chairman said, these men and women that did this mission, they just want to do their job. They're not expecting their story to be told. They're not expecting the glory. They are grateful for the flags and the hugs of family. That's why they do the job. But they also know they were a part of something historic.  We know how historic it was. The Chairman does. I know. Our staffs know. And so that's why we are \u2013 and the President of the United States knows. And that's why it's almost personal when we see the way in which leaks are used to try to disparage the outcome or muddy the waters about the impact of what happened without being responsible with information and allowing the professionals to assess and provide that information just like the Chairman did.  So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that information. And we welcome a few additional questions. Yes, sir. General, on Sunday you said final battle damage will take some time. And you also said, I think BDA is still pending, and it would be way too early.  for me to comment on what may or may not still be there at nuclear facility. That was just over three days ago. So what has changed? Would you use the term obliterated as well?"}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1863.949, "text": "Sir, like I said, we don't do BDA. I'll refer that to the intelligence community.

Sir, I think I said...  I mean, I think I explained what changed. There was a great deal of irresponsible reporting based on leaks, preliminary information in low confidence. Again, when someone leaks something, they do it with an agenda.  And when you leak a portion of an intelligence assessment, but just a little portion, just a little portion that makes it seem like maybe the strike wasn't effective, then you start a news cycle, whether it's the Washington Post or Fox News or CNN or MSNBC, you start a news cycle that starts to call into question the ethics. That's why.  So you bring the chairman here, who's not involved in politics. He didn't do politics. That's my lane to understand and translate and talk about those types of things. So I can use the word obliterated. He could use defeat, destroy, assess, all of those things. But ultimately, we're here to clarify what these weapons are capable of, which anyone with two eyes, some ears, and a brain can recognize that kind of firepower.  with that specificity at that location and others is going to have a devastating effect. So we all recognize there will be days and weeks ahead. That's why yesterday I said if you want to know what's going on in Florida.  You better go there and get a big shovel, because no one's under there right now. No one's under there able to assess, and everyone's using reflections of what they see. And that's why the Israelis, the Iranians, the IAEA, the UN, to a man and to a woman who recognize the capability of this weapons system are acknowledging how destructive it's been. So that's what's changed.  This is a point, this is how difficult it is to actually manage. You just watched a video of what this weapon is capable of. That's where we find our confidence is in the skill of men and women and the capability of the systems they employed and the recognition so far in the reflections that it was a highly successful mission."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1982.272, "text": " Sir, I think you could, I'd say go out.

I was reading from the CIA director's statement, which came out last night. CIA, again, they do the BDA, they do the assessment.  CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates, it also goes on to say, new intelligence from historically reliable and accurate sources and methods. Now, you can imagine, you can imagine the CIA director is going to be very careful about how he articulates things of that sensitivity. Classified, secret, top secret, compartmentalized, he's going to know things  You're not going to know. But the press isn't going to know. And he's reflecting that the sources he's seeing are highly credible. They've given credible intelligence. They or those processes have given credible intelligence in the past.

So your job is to step back and assess them. And that's why we're urging caution about  putting it, premising entire stories on biased leaks to biased publications trying to make something look bad. How about we take a beat, recognize first the success of our warriors, hold them up, tell their stories, celebrate that, wave an American flag, be proud of what we accomplished. And in the meantime, I can assure you, the chairman and his staff, the intelligence community, our staff and others are doing all the assessments necessary to make sure that mission was indeed successful. Yes, right there.  Sir, thank you. Mr. Secretary, Iran has recognized that their nuclear program was indeed severely damaged, but they also said that the U.S. strikes only strengthen their ability and their determination to complete their nuclear program. How do you respond to that, sir? Is that a provocation from Iran?  I would say Iran's going to have to say a lot of things right now in order to bolster their image, especially internally. You know, in the media, there's a lot of things they'll say for domestic consumption. But we're watching very closely what they do. Again, that's the intel community. Our job as the chairman \u2013 I mean, the chairman laid it out so beautifully. Our job is to be prepared.  And how proud are you? How proud am I? I didn't know the full story of those men and women 15 years ago who've been pointing at that target. That makes me proud to be an American. That's an awesome story. I hope we can tell more aspects of that in an unclassified way in the future. That's a great thing to know. Our job is to be prepared when the Commander-in-Chief calls based on those assessments. So, of course, our IC, the Intelligence Committee, will keep watching what Iran does and pay attention to that. But the President has created the contours, the opportunity  for a deal, for peace in something that the world said was intractable, that wasn't possible. And we got that peace, that ceasefire, that option because of strength, because of his willingness to use American military might that no one else on the planet can do with the kind of planners and operators that the chairman just laid out.  Yes, sir, right there, yep. Yes, sir? Just a quick question. There's public imagery available saying that highly enriched uranium was moved out of Fordow before the strikes. Is that accurate?

And under President Trump, the fact that you know you're going to get permits, you're going to be able to build infrastructure, you're not going to be demonized and threatened with giant tax increases all the time, President Trump is lowering the cost to produce oil and natural gas in the United States. And that means that balancing point around which prices will balance is lower than it was before.  The fastest-growing piece of our oil production is natural gas liquids. These are things that come along when you produce natural gas. And what did Trump do on day one? End the pause on natural gas export terminals. We've approved more increased capacity for export terminals in just these first 130 days than the amount of capacity of our second-largest country, Qatar, in Australia, as natural gas exporters.

Thank God President Trump was elected. So we're doing everything possible now to sweep out the nonsense, but a lot of nonsense was in there. For example, in my department, we've issued four emergency orders just in the last few weeks to stop the closure of reliable plants so we can keep the lights on and stop pushing up electricity prices.  We had to issue an emergency order a few days ago just to let utilities in the Southeast run their plants at full capacity so they could keep the lights on. Under the Biden laws, that's illegal. Emissions rules would have prevented them from producing all the electricity they could, and they would have had rolling brownouts. That's just total nonsense.

If you look at what the members of the committee, where they think the settling point is, there's pretty wide agreement. It's well below where we are today. The tariffs and other uncertainties in the economy threw a bunch of dust in the air. So I do think it's important that we get clarity, A, that there's not going to be an increase in inflation.  Or B, if there is going to be an increase in inflation, that it's not going to be a lasting increase in inflation, that it is in fact going to be transitory. Now, like you say, Steve, we've had three but nine months of inflation readings. And for a month and a half of that, we had the beginnings of tariffs.  So if tariffs stay in their lane, which is to say imported goods are only 11% of GDP, so if people don't freak out and change their behavior, and if we don't get a lot of retaliation from other countries, and if we don't jack up the rates on raising the cost of domestic production,  then my hope would be that we don't see the inflation.

That was literally the same logic at the time of COVID that said, this is going to be transitory, hit to the supply shock, inflation is going to go away.

If there isn't inflation that comes from the tariffs, though, and if we want to explain the data, if you look at the data, the non-tariff affected or less tariff affected parts like services, like housing, they've been particularly encouraging.

Our HBM, high bandwidth memory, which is a critical enabler for AI systems,  grew 50 percent sequentially and we are already at if you look at our FQ3 results HBM is already at an annualized run rate of six billion dollars more than six billion dollars. So we see that growing nicely for us in fiscal year 26 as well in terms of HBM demand. And we also saw  a strong sequential growth in the consumer demand.
