Article 1, section 8 of the US Constitution  says that it's the federal government and Congress who should coin money and determine the value thereof. But our Republican friends tell us that that means that the federal government should be stuck with 1776 technology while the competitors of the dollar race forward in the 21st century. The largest super PAC expenditures in history occurred last year.  The crypto industry spent more on independent expenditures. Take a look at this. You combine all of the expenditures from big oil plus big pharma, put them together, multiply by five, and you still don't have what the crypto industry did last year. And so it's not surprising that we hear words like freedom.  innovation, choice, and competitiveness used to justify making money for the crypto bros, and now we have a bill designed to prevent freedom, innovation, choice, and competitiveness when it poses a risk to their profits. This bill not only prevents us from ever having a digital dollar,  It prevents us from even studying a digital dollar. Now, I think Americans will always have banks, credit cards, debit cards, Zelle, Venmo, cash, money market funds, and pursuant to the bill that it looks like we're going to pass today, they'll have stablecoin, a privacy device,  specifically designed for criminals and tax evaders. And then they'll have mixers to make it impossible for even the most advanced law enforcement, even with a warrant, to find out what's happening. So they have all those choices. What's the one choice you're not allowed to have? You're not allowed to have the currency provided for in the U.S. Constitution. You're not allowed to have a digital dollar or even a study of a digital dollar.  You're not allowed to, if you, and if you don't want to carry a lot of paper around, you can't have the full faith and credit of the United States. Now we've talked about the role of the U.S. dollar and the critical role that it plays in international transactions and why that is a major economic benefit to the United States. The crypto bros occasionally tell you out loud what they're thinking. And that is they want to minimize and destroy the role of the U.S. dollar internationally.  So what do they do to hobble the dollar? They say the Chinese Communist Party can have a digital yuan. The Bitcoin bros can have a digital currency. But America is limited to 70-76 technology. Our banking system is the envy of the world because we innovate. This bill says no innovation.

I think the tariff delay, the front loading that we've seen from some of the U.S. as well and other markets, and the transcriptment, as I said, through other economies that part of it ended in U.S.  And just a general redirection for China into other markets has obviously provided a relief, but also has supported the growth for ASEAN economies. So, that resilience and redirection that we've seen certainly has benefited the ASEAN economy. Then other theme that obviously has been present is the tech. So, tech is still alive and AI and development, which has led to increased demand for chips, which ASEAN, again, is part of that supply chain for chips, which has provided resilience.  As we go into the second part of the year, I think that element related to tariff delay, the front loading and transshipment is going to wind down. But I think the tech theme is still going to be present. But a combination of that with probably deceleration of the onshore demand will probably have a weaker growth in the broader Asia, including China.

And I think if I had to caveat and kind of broaden and canvas the broader trade negotiations,  I think the market expectation is, by and large, that the tariffs that were voiced in the past were the upper limit of it, and the majority of the trading partners will get a lower rate, unless, of course, they try to impose tariffs on the U.S. and, again, escalation of tit-for-tat, which we've seen in case of China.

We've seen that against the euro because, of course, we've seen as part of the tariffs escalation is the uncertainty of U.S. assets has been in the spotlight. So investors looked increasingly to diversify away from U.S. into other markets. And Europe, despite DCB being ahead of the Fed, was a key beneficiary of that  that inflows. Also, from Asia, what we've seen, a trend that we've seen again materializing this year is that the hedging costs for dollar assets is still prohibitive relative to European assets.

And, again, what is Japan government conflicted with at the moment is an economy that is emerging out of kind of this stagnation, but is not yet thriving. It needs a support, a support when the monetary policy needs to normalize and the fiscal policy does not have room.  They would have, and they should, use some element of support. But, again, the room is limited. And we've seen, obviously, the elections that are coming up in upper house on the 20th of July kind of putting a lot of pressure on the JGBs because of that need to provide additional fiscal stimulus, which, again, the room is limited.  When it comes to Korea, certainly the dynamics are related to tariffs, of course. Tech is part of the theme that has kept Korea resilient. And in Korea, what we had is a lot of political instability.

I mean, we've seen this in the behavior out of Trump and the tariffs. I know that this is a far more dangerous game to be playing, but I really feel it's unlikely that Trump would fire the Fed chair. I mean, it would be extremely destabilizing to the markets. We saw that when the announcement was out. I think the S&P dropped 40 or 50 points.  There was a spike in gold. And then on the denial, all that kind of reversed and seemed to the market found a little solace in it. I think that, you know, Trump is not unaware that this would be an extremely negative event for the markets. You know, there's no secret that Trump follows the markets very, very closely.  If he were to fire the Fed chairman right now, I think you'd see gold soar. You'd see a massive spike in interest rates. And obviously, it would affect the equity market.  You know, I really kind of feel like this is the game that he's playing here is we've seen the dollar depreciate considerably. You know, there's it's kind of pick your adventure here watching the markets respond to Fed's to the Trump administration's policy. You know, we're seeing this depreciation in the dollar. And Trump administration's made no bones about it, that the weaker dollar is something that they favor.  you know, is really supportive of the country's industrial fabric. It encourages exports. It may offset some of the damage that, you know, the economy is feeling or potentially fearing, I should say, from the tariffs.

It might not be as dramatic, but it would gradually continue to weaken the dollar.

I think that the Fed's independence is paramount here. And I think you have to rely on the fact that this is a pro-business administration. And I think there's still a lot of gamesmanship here.

And then a quarter or two to show up in the economy. So you're right. I mean today or yesterday is PPI.  was a bit benign and certainly lower than expected, but the CPI came in a little bit hotter.

Lael Brainard is with us right now. It's good to have you with us this afternoon. And that's exactly where I want to start. We spoke to Mike McKee out in Victor, Idaho, and he said there was a collective eye roll when he saw the news earlier this morning from the other  members of the Federal Reserve and Fed watchers out there. Do you look at the news that we got this morning, the comments from the president that we got this morning as being different than other criticism of Jay Powell in the past?  I think there's a lot of continuity. He has clearly been very frustrated for some period of time with the Federal Reserve and their wait-and-see mode while they wait to see how tariffs are going to affect inflation and the economy.  And, you know, he's very impatient to see rates come down. So I saw those comments today as being certainly in that same spirit, although, of course, the rumors early in the day had more urgency to them. Of course, subsequent to that, he seems to have pulled back the comments. And that's a good thing.

So if the president of the United States were  to go ahead and actually make an effort to remove the chair of the Federal Reserve that would fly in the face of decades of institutional convention that puts the Federal Reserve in an independent position to pursue the control of inflation as well as keeping labor markets strong. And I think it would really raise important questions in the minds of  investors in the United States and around the world as to whether the institutional environment that really underpins the value of Treasury securities, the strength of the dollar, and the expectation that inflation will remain low and stable in the United States, all of those things,  I think would be thrown into question, and that should lead investors to demand more to hold long-term treasury. So that should lead to the long end of the curve going up. Whenever the Fed chair gives a press conference, he's asked by journalists about the criticism that the president has made or is making about him. You've worked with Jay Powell for years. You know him. In your view, how does he feel about being this punching bag?  So I don't know how he feels personally, but I know that anybody in that position would feel that they have an important constitutional responsibility, that he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate that there is a legal  a set of expectations regarding the Federal Reserve Chair's role. And of course, monetary policy is set by a committee. It's not set by the Chair alone. And so it is the Federal Open Markets Committee that has  continue to hold on rates. So it's a much broader institutional environment and personalizing it by this relentless focus on the chair, I think is extremely problematic. Again, bad for the United States and ultimately defeats the purpose that I think the president is trying to achieve, which is to see rates go down sustainably in an environment of growth and low inflation."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 290.433, "text": " When you look at the history of political pressure exerted upon the Fed, how do you make sense of today?

And we've seen in those episodes high inflation, and the Fed has really struggled to bring inflation back down. So I think this is a kind of similar set of pressures to what some Fed chairs have felt in the past, but not in the recent past.  I think in the, you know, during the period that we have seen low and stable moderate what they call the great moderation, low and stable inflation. There has been a real understanding that the president, the administration should allow the.  So this is a big change relative to the last three decades and it's highly problematic.  you know, the president h that he wants to see the rates come down. This is will save him $300 billion  interest payments on the national debt. And of course, that's more important than ever now that we've just added through the mega law, another $4 trillion to the national debt. And so when you hear the president talking about this, he really seems to be very focused on those interest payments. And that is exactly the kind of institutional environment that would undermine the credibility of the Federal Reserve in fighting inflation and could actually lead investors to demand higher  interest rates on long term treasuries. That's the great irony in this this whole situation here. I just we have 20 seconds left. I just want you to make a prediction. Do you think Fed Chair Jay Powell will fulfill his term as the chairman of the Federal Reserve until May of next year? I certainly hope so. And yes, I do.

What we are also seeing is how the capital markets can be the delta for getting stronger growth and also higher estimates expected from the street looking ahead, both for revenue and earnings.  those that are more balanced or exposed to Main Street America, consumer and small business, are likely to see much slower growth and some risk of kind of sluggish demand in the future.

And what we've seen even in the second quarter or year to date is  tremendous performance, more than two times the S&P 500 for diversified banks. But that's not the point. The key point is, where do they go from here? We think the Delta, not only for the rest of this year, but really these stocks are going to be priced on 2026 earnings, is going to be how they do into next year. Obviously, two to four rate cuts, some easing on the regulatory framework,  and then also some opening up in the capital markets for investment banking. That's going to help these banks. When you look at them, you know, in terms of P.E. multiples or what Gina was talking about, the overall market, they have to earn into these valuations or multiples.  When we look at more conservative metrics, which a lot of bank analysts look at because they're a conservative lot, such as price to net tangible book value, they're pretty expensive. But I think it's earnings growth and what that does in terms of confidence that they can still have upside over the next year or two. That's the key.  can i be remiss if we didn't ask you about the drama with regard to fed chair jay powell the reports emerging early today that he would be fired by the president and the president was seriously considering doing that we saw a market reaction from the equity side and from the fixed income side and then just a little later in the morning we heard from the president who denied  that he would do that imminently, yet there are certainly concerns about the way that the president feels about the Fed share. We all know that. What would it mean for banks if this were to happen? Would it mean anything? So I'm a global director and I look at markets all over the world. And also, when you look at the bond market and really the 10 and 30 year treasury,  the Fed really matters. It's independence, the respect and responsibility of its two mandates for inflation and full employment. I just think this is color or drama. You know, Jay Powell is highly regarded. And the other issue, of course, is when his term is up next year, likely probably to retire, but he could stay on for a few more years as as a governor.

That's where I would really look as a delta that we haven't seen really in the numbers and size as it relates to mergers and acquisitions, equity underwriting, or other forms of transactions.  look to lower rates, making it more appealing to valuation for both public and private transactions, that's going to be a bonanza for the large banks.

Markets initially cheered the idea that tariffs may not be severe as feared, but that optimism is starting to fade and we're starting to see the first signs of an inflationary impact. So for instance, this week's CPI is one example of that warning. So bond markets are responding  Longer-dated yields are beginning to climb. And with us to make sense of all of those market moves is Simeon Heymann. He is global investment strategist and head of investment strategy at ProShare. That's an ETF issuer that manages some $85 billion in assets. So not really that much. I'm kidding. It's a lot. So thank you, Simeon.  Before anything, we really have to start with a story of the day, and that is Jerome Powell, the fate of the Fed chair. As a strategist, how do you make sense of all of this? Are these real so-called threats, or are they just noise?"}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 16, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 967.077, "text": "Well, thanks for having me. What I find very interesting about this is I think that the president is making the same mistake that a lot of investors do. And what do I mean by that? The focus on the Fed funds rate. In the absence of quantitative easing,  The Fed only controls the overnight lending rate. Longer term yields are determined by market forces. We can park quantitative easing, the thing that happened in the great financial crisis and in the pandemic, but in the absence of that, what history shows is that if the Fed cuts, that usually is a steepener because it's stimulating the economy and the long end usually sells off a little bit. So it's almost a misguided focus because if you get what you wish for,  That's not going to bring down longer term rates. They're driven primarily by inflation, which we see benign reading this morning, but still overall ticking up just a little bit. And the long end has been selling off for a couple of months. So ironically, the best way to bring rates down would be to bring inflation under control. Correct. I mean, that's really the only way of like this is this is macroeconomics 101. It's 101. And the numbers are pretty clear. Yeah. The real rate on the above inflation for the 10 year treasury historically is somewhere around two and a half percent.  So if we really got to two, then you're talking four and a half, which is where we are. But if we end up sitting around two and a half, three, that's where you can have that five handle. So if the real way to bring rates down is to get inflation under control, how do you view the new tariff regime?  Well, that's the risk, and I think part of the tariff story is euphoria around the acknowledgment that it's not going to be as bad as it looked like on Liberation Day. But, as you noted, the euphoria is wearing out, because if we end up with 10 or 15 percent across the board, that's still a lot more than the three we had prior to this administration.

Is the market taking the threat of tariffs going into full effect August 1st seriously right now?  There's a little bit of the euphoria that I just spoke about. In other words, since it's not as bad as the stuff from the lawn on April 2nd, there was such a relief rally. And that might have gone a little bit too far. But I think that's not the only reason that the market has rallied so strongly since roughly April 8th. And that is the fact that fundamentals are so strong. Whether you look at the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ 100, compared to 20 years ago,  return on assets stronger, profit margins stronger. Everything is there in spades.

So you absolutely do want some other sources of diversification. Think about it this way. If you look at bonds, bonds traditionally the offset to equity risk, but that doesn't always work.  It didn't work Liberation Day. Remember, we had the de-dollarization thing and bonds sold off with stocks. And of course, the wound in everybody's psyche is from 2022. The equity market went down 20%.  Long treasuries went down 30 in 2022. So we can't quite count on either bonds or the dollar for either perfect stability or diversification. You've got to look elsewhere. Where do you look? A couple of ideas that we think are important. First, this is a particularly strong environment for cryptocurrency. We know that the regulatory environment has improved a little bit.  But we also improved a little bit. I mean, it's like we're waiting and it looks good. You know I'm I don't do the political beat. Yeah, the odds are something's gonna happen and it doesn't have to be perfect well markets are the crypto markets are marketing believe that believe that and again the the view of  The leading voices there are the regulation doesn't have to be perfect. Just give us something that's reasonable. We'll know what to do. OK, whenever somebody is on our air and says cryptocurrency, I always get pushed back online because people say Bitcoin, not all crypto is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not all crypto. So when you say cryptocurrency as an option out there, what specifically are you talking about?  Well, you can go beyond Bitcoin. And Ether is certainly a reasonable opportunity. And then you have a couple of sister guys. You have Solana, which is more in the Ether camp. And then you have XRP, as an example, with the fixed supply that's more in the Bitcoin camp. So I think there's an opportunity there to be a little bit more diversified. And I think the mistake some folks make in the crypto landscape is they think that, well, it's just a risk asset.  Like everything, it's just going up with the equity rally. But you remember three years ago when the crypto related banks were Bitcoin went up. Yeah. It really can be a diversifier. So I think that's one. You don't think that it's too, has too short of a history to call it a diversifier. It emerged after the financial crisis.

It doesn't mean that you dive in and hold your nose and just go to the bottom of the ocean. But think about, in the equity markets as well, think about the AI disruption.  You know, way back when, in the late 90s, there was this book called The Innovator's Dilemma. And it said that the thesis of The Innovator's Dilemma was that incumbent companies cannot take advantage of technological innovation because it screws up their cash cows. Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School, a legend who just passed away a few years ago. I didn't even realize that. Now, today, we got a lot of incumbents who appear to be  making a ton of coin off of this disruptive technology, which is entirely different than that thesis. But there are still some disruptors, too. So we have this environment where I think you have to at least participate in the disruption, but still have a lot of the legacy companies and, of course, legacy diversifiers. It's not that you don't want bonds, but you don't know that they're going to diversify you. And cryptocurrency and the blockchain is a real thing that's not going anywhere.

So as the government went in for equity, we saw companies like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs also come to the table with a significant amount of capital.

Here are the stories we're following today. Karen, we begin with the story that has had markets in a head spin, the White House pressure campaign on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. President Trump reportedly floated the idea of firing the Fed chair in a room of congressional Republicans this week. The president says he does not intend to fire Powell, but in Oval Office comments heard live on Bloomberg Radio, he did have a caveat.  I don't rule out anything, but I think it's highly unlikely, unless he has to leave fraud. I mean, it's possible there's fraud involved with the $2.5, $2.7 billion renovation. President Trump has said the renovation of the Fed's two main buildings is over budget and too lavish.  While Nathan Bloomberg's Annmarie Hordern was in the Oval Office for the President's remarks, she asked about reports that he waved a draft letter firing Powell before Congressional Republicans. So you didn't show a letter to Republican lawmakers last night? No, I talked about the concept of firing them. I said, what do you think? Almost every one of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are.  And it's unclear whether the president has the power to remove the Fed's chair, but the pressure might not let up. Several of the president's aides, including White House Budget Director Russell Vought and Federal Housing Finance Chief Bill Pulte, are pushing to inspect the Fed's renovation. Of course, Karen, you can expect that plenty of reaction will continue to pour into the possibility of firing the Fed chair. Bloomberg's David Westin caught up with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.  The Fed is an independent agency, and they're meant to be outside the purview of the executive and Congress. They are called to task, and they're monitored, and they're reviewed, and all the things. But the reality was it was set up to be independent so that our central bank in America was independent. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan's thoughts were echoed by Massachusetts Senator and frequent Powell critic Elizabeth Warren. She tells Bloomberg the Fed needs to remain independent.  People in the cabinet, people who are serving in the administration, serve at the pleasure of the president. That is the structure, that is fine. Donald Trump wants to get mad at one of them and fire him, have at it, baby. But it's different for the Fed chair, and that is why that office needs to be held by someone who is independent. For the full conversations with Elizabeth Warren and Brian Moynihan, head over to the Bloomberg Podcast channel on YouTube.  Well, Nathan, a few hours ago, the Senate passed about $9 billion in federal spending cuts requested by President Trump, including deep reductions to public broadcasting and foreign aid. And we get the latest at Bloomberg's Monica Rix.  The 51 to 48 vote wraps up a 13 hour vote-a-rama on the Senate floor, passing President Trump's request to cut about $8 billion in global aid programs, including USAID, and another billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations like NPR and PBS."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 189.24, "text": "Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine joined all Democrats in opposing the package."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 195.586, "text": "It now heads to the House for approval ahead of a deadline tomorrow before Trump can sign it into  Now to the latest on the trade front. President Trump says he'll send letters to more than 150 countries notifying them their tariff rates could be 10 or 15 percent.

Fewer than half of the companies surveyed by the U.S.-China Business Council between March and May said they plan to invest in China in 2025. That's a drop from 80 percent last year and a record low since the group began asking a similar question in 2006.  Karen, a major gathering of foreign policy professionals is underway in Colorado, but as Bloomberg's David Gurra reports, the Trump administration decided at the last minute not to allow senior Pentagon officials to participate.  The Defense Department made the announcement one day before the Aspen Security Forum was scheduled to start, saying its values were not aligned with the administration's. Organizers had to cancel onstage interviews with combatant commanders at a conference that has traditionally hosted officials from Democratic and Republican administrations. Former Ambassador Nicholas Burns, who helps run the forum, addressed the Pentagon's decision in his opening remarks. We regret it very much, but here's our response.  and we put out a statement, you can all read it, our door is open, obviously, to the Trump administration. We want our government to succeed. Speakers will include officials from President Trump's first term alongside advisors to Presidents Obama and Biden. In Aspen, Colorado, I'm David Gura, Bloomberg Radio.  All right, David, thank you. Well, President Trump also continues to face questions about his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. But he says the focus on the late sex offender is a distraction. It's all been a big hoax. It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net.

Turning to markets now, Karen, the S&P 500 enters the day near all-time highs after whipsawing yesterday on the Fed News. Earnings continue today. A dozen companies in the S&P 500 will be reporting, including Netflix. We get a preview from Bloomberg's Tom Busby.  Thanks to the breadth of its content, its pricing power, its advertising-supported tier and password-sharing crackdown, Netflix now has over 300 million global subscribers. And new seasons of hits like Squid Games, Wednesday, Stranger Things, and more will surely keep those subscribers paying up.  But Netflix no longer reports subscriber numbers, so investors will have to look at advertising revenue from its push into live sports programming like WWE Raw and UFC events. Bloomberg Consensus calls for revenue of $11.06 billion, earnings per share of $7.09. Tom Busby, Bloomberg Radio.  All right, Tom, thank you.

While we do have a frontal system headed our way, it doesn't look like we're going to have the right combination to produce flash flooding across a wide section of the New York City area or in southern New England like we had last week. There was some isolated flooding outside the District of Columbia last night, but just don't have the right ingredients. That's not to say that some of the thunderstorms will pass through the region today, won't be able to produce heavy rain and localized flooding. It's just I don't expect as many wide areas as we saw outside of Boston last week or around the tri-state area as we had earlier this week.  I'm Rob Carolin, Bloomberg Radio. Thank you, Rob.

Following the big bank's beat on earnings, Moynihan joined Bloomberg's David Westin to discuss the results, small business health, and independence of the Federal Reserve. Brian Moynihan also offered his long-term economic  Let's listen in.  I'm importing goods and manufacturing them, further manufacturing and selling them. It got pretty interesting here trying to figure out all the trade and tariffs. So I think the certainty on a tax rate helps them, meaning the big beautiful bill passing and the tax rate, that's a very good thing. The alternative would not been good if their tax rates would change. A satisfactory resolution to the trade so that they could learn the rules of the road over the next 30, 60, 90 days and get their plans for next year put together.  And I think ultimately, we're going to have to have a satisfactory resolution on immigration and population growth. Because at the end of the day, what I'm hearing more from construction companies, farming companies, and travel and entertainment type companies is, I'm starting to worry about, I'm starting to struggle with labor availability at any price. And that's not, that we got to make sure they have the workers because they will supply a great service economy and continue to grow.  One of the things you reported today was net interest income, which is really important to all banks, but particularly Bank of America, and just steady growth that you're showing in that. How sensitive are you to the rates set by the Fed? If that comes down substantially, does that affect Bank of America much?  So embedded in our estimates. So we we've told our the world that this quarter we had $14.8 billion in net interest income, and that is the fourth straight quarter of growth and came off the floor last year. This quarter when I was talking to you was the lowest it's been. This quarter was a record in the company's history, and we're saying we're gonna grow from that record to 15 5 to 15 7 in two more quarters, a third quarter in the fourth quarter that embeds in it. The rate cuts in the market that are expected by the market. We don't  We only show it that way. If you have rate cuts over, above that, that would hurt that number, but it would still grow, frankly. And so, and that, the good thing about that is because the great loan deposit growth, 7% loan growth, 4% deposit growth over the last year, that's in the system, that's capitalized in, I mean, that's here, it doesn't go away. And as that continues to stay and we add to it, what you're starting to see is that sets us up great for next year for further NII growth and further EPS growth.  This quarter was the trickiest quarter to get through because year over year, we finally got some NII growth, but year over year, the market's business doing strong, so expense growth is a little more robust. That'll get lined, and then you'll see NII drop to the bottom line, and it will set up for 2026 with even more growth.  talking about 2026, one of the things we're going to have is an all likely a new Fed chair. There's been a lot of talk even today in Washington about the Fed chair. And you said you believe in an independent Fed. But if in fact, President Trump gets his wish as his right under law to appoint a new chair who will be more in line with his views. He said he thinks the interest rate was free at 1% or even below that. Is that good for Bank of America? Is that good for the economy?  Well, let me make two things. One is, you're absolutely right. In May of next year, the term of the current Fed chair ends after being reappointed. And it's the right of the elected president to appoint the next successor and go through Congress. And I think in that dialogue around that, there'll be a lot of dialogue about, okay, how do you set interest rates? What do you think about interest rates? Because the Fed is an independent agency, and they're meant to be outside the purview of the executive and Congress. They are called to task, and they're monitored, and they're  and they're reviewed and all the things. But the reality was it's set up to be independent, so our central bank in America was independent. So I think no matter who gets in, they're gonna look at it and have to look at the facts and make a decision. Because if you drop rates too far, inflation may kick up, and then you're gonna have to raise them back quickly.  On the other hand, if you think the prior Fed has been slow to lower rates, you might lower them faster. Our team believes that the Fed will lower rates in the second half of next year by 100 basis points. No change until then, because inflation is still going through the system. That brings the Fed funds rate down closer to three, which they think is probably more of a long-term rate, and frankly, is more similar to what we had for most of American history. What's been unusual is the period after the global financial crisis, a very low interest rate structure. That is really not a good place to be.  Honestly, we'd rather have a higher interest rate structure, a little more inflation, a little more robust economic growth. So I think everybody has to be a little careful about keeping that engine going, because if this engine fails, the whole world fails.

Lael Brainard is with us right now. It's good to have you with us this afternoon. And that's exactly where I want to start. We spoke to Mike McKee out in Victor, Idaho, and he said there was a collective eye roll when he saw the news earlier this morning from the other  members of the Federal Reserve and Fed watchers out there. Do you look at the news that we got this morning, the comments from the president that we got this morning as being different than other criticism of Jay Powell in the past?  I think there's a lot of continuity. He has clearly been very frustrated for some period of time with the Federal Reserve and their wait-and-see mode while they wait to see how tariffs are going to affect inflation and the economy.  And, you know, he's very impatient to see rates come down. So I saw those comments today as being certainly in that same spirit, although, of course, the rumors early in the day had more urgency to them. Of course, subsequent to that, he seems to have pulled back the comments. And that's a good thing.

So if the president of the United States were  to go ahead and actually make an effort to remove the chair of the Federal Reserve that would fly in the face of decades of institutional convention that puts the Federal Reserve in an independent position to pursue the control of inflation as well as keeping labor markets strong. And I think it would really raise important questions in the minds of  investors in the United States and around the world as to whether the institutional environment that really underpins the value of Treasury securities, the strength of the dollar, and the expectation that inflation will remain low and stable in the United States, all of those things,  I think would be thrown into question, and that should lead investors to demand more to hold long-term treasury. So that should lead to the long end of the curve going up. Whenever the Fed chair gives a press conference, he's asked by journalists about the criticism that the president has made or is making about him. You've worked with Jay Powell for years. You know him. In your view, how does he feel about being this punching bag?  So I don't know how he feels personally, but I know that anybody in that position would feel that they have an important constitutional responsibility, that he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate that there is a legal  a set of expectations regarding the Federal Reserve Chair's role. And of course, monetary policy is set by a committee. It's not set by the Chair alone. And so it is the Federal Open Markets Committee that has  continue to hold on rates. So it's a much broader institutional environment and personalizing it by this relentless focus on the chair, I think is extremely problematic.

And we've seen in those episodes high inflation, and the Fed has really struggled to bring inflation back down. So I think this is a kind of similar set of pressures to what some Fed chairs have felt in the past, but not in the recent past.  I think in the, you know, during the period that we have seen low and stable moderate what they call the great moderation, low and stable inflation. There has been a real understanding that the president, the administration should allow the.  So this is a big change relative to the last three decades and it's highly problematic.  you know, the president h that he wants to see the rates come down. This is will save him $300 billion  interest payments on the national debt. And of course, that's more important than ever now that we've just added through the mega law, another $4 trillion to the national debt. And so when you hear the president talking about this, he really seems to be very focused on those interest payments. And that is exactly the kind of institutional environment that would undermine the credibility of the Federal Reserve in fighting inflation and could actually lead investors to demand higher  interest rates on long term treasuries. That's the great irony in this this whole situation here. I just we have 20 seconds left. I just want you to make a prediction. Do you think Fed Chair Jay Powell will fulfill his term as the chairman of the Federal Reserve until May of next year? I certainly hope so. And yes, I do.

And what we've seen even in the second quarter or year to date is  tremendous performance, more than two times the S&P 500 for diversified banks. But that's not the point. The key point is, where do they go from here? We think the Delta, not only for the rest of this year, but really these stocks are going to be priced on 2026 earnings, is going to be how they do into next year. Obviously, two to four rate cuts, some easing on the regulatory framework,  and then also some opening up in the capital markets for investment banking. That's going to help these banks. When you look at them, you know, in terms of P.E. multiples or what Gina was talking about, the overall market, they have to earn into these valuations or multiples.  When we look at more conservative metrics, which a lot of bank analysts look at because they're a conservative lot, such as price to net tangible book value, they're pretty expensive. But I think it's earnings growth and what that does in terms of confidence that they can still have upside over the next year or two. That's the key.  can i be remiss if we didn't ask you about the drama with regard to fed chair jay powell the reports emerging early today that he would be fired by the president and the president was seriously considering doing that we saw a market reaction from the equity side and from the fixed income side and then just a little later in the morning we heard from the president who denied  that he would do that imminently, yet there are certainly concerns about the way that the president feels about the Fed share. We all know that. What would it mean for banks if this were to happen? Would it mean anything? So I'm a global director and I look at markets all over the world. And also, when you look at the bond market and really the 10 and 30 year treasury,  the Fed really matters. It's independence, the respect and responsibility of its two mandates for inflation and full employment. I just think this is color or drama. You know, Jay Powell is highly regarded. And the other issue, of course, is when his term is up next year, likely probably to retire, but he could stay on for a few more years as as a governor.

What I find very interesting about this is I think that the president is making the same mistake that a lot of investors do. And what do I mean by that? The focus on the Fed funds rate. In the absence of quantitative easing,  The Fed only controls the overnight lending rate. Longer term yields are determined by market forces. We can park quantitative easing, the thing that happened in the great financial crisis and in the pandemic, but in the absence of that, what history shows is that if the Fed cuts, that usually is a steepener because it's stimulating the economy and the long end usually sells off a little bit. So it's almost a misguided focus because if you get what you wish for,  That's not going to bring down longer term rates. They're driven primarily by inflation, which we see benign reading this morning, but still overall ticking up just a little bit. And the long end has been selling off for a couple of months. So ironically, the best way to bring rates down would be to bring inflation under control. Correct. I mean, that's really the only way of like this is this is macroeconomics 101. It's 101. And the numbers are pretty clear. Yeah. The real rate on the above inflation for the 10 year treasury historically is somewhere around two and a half percent.  So if we really got to two, then you're talking four and a half, which is where we are. But if we end up sitting around two and a half, three, that's where you can have that five handle. So if the real way to bring rates down is to get inflation under control, how do you view the new tariff regime?  Well, that's the risk, and I think part of the tariff story is euphoria around the acknowledgment that it's not going to be as bad as it looked like on Liberation Day. But, as you noted, the euphoria is wearing out, because if we end up with 10 or 15 percent across the board, that's still a lot more than the three we had prior to this administration.

Is the market taking the threat of tariffs going into full effect August 1st seriously right now?  There's a little bit of the euphoria that I just spoke about. In other words, since it's not as bad as the stuff from the lawn on April 2nd, there was such a relief rally. And that might have gone a little bit too far. But I think that's not the only reason that the market has rallied so strongly since roughly April 8th. And that is the fact that fundamentals are so strong. Whether you look at the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ 100, compared to 20 years ago,  return on assets stronger, profit margins stronger. Everything is there in spades.

So you absolutely do want some other sources of diversification. Think about it this way. If you look at bonds, bonds traditionally the offset to equity risk, but that doesn't always work.  It didn't work Liberation Day. Remember, we had the de-dollarization thing and bonds sold off with stocks. And of course, the wound in everybody's psyche is from 2022. The equity market went down 20%.  Long treasuries went down 30 in 2022. So we can't quite count on either bonds or the dollar for either perfect stability or diversification. You've got to look elsewhere. Where do you look? A couple of ideas that we think are important. First, this is a particularly strong environment for cryptocurrency. We know that the regulatory environment has improved a little bit.  But we also improved a little bit. I mean, it's like we're waiting and it looks good. You know I'm I don't do the political beat. Yeah, the odds are something's gonna happen and it doesn't have to be perfect well markets are the crypto markets are marketing believe that believe that and again the the view of  The leading voices there are the regulation doesn't have to be perfect. Just give us something that's reasonable. We'll know what to do. OK, whenever somebody is on our air and says cryptocurrency, I always get pushed back online because people say Bitcoin, not all crypto is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not all crypto. So when you say cryptocurrency as an option out there, what specifically are you talking about?  Well, you can go beyond Bitcoin. And Ether is certainly a reasonable opportunity. And then you have a couple of sister guys. You have Solana, which is more in the Ether camp. And then you have XRP, as an example, with the fixed supply that's more in the Bitcoin camp. So I think there's an opportunity there to be a little bit more diversified. And I think the mistake some folks make in the crypto landscape is they think that, well, it's just a risk asset.  Like everything, it's just going up with the equity rally. But you remember three years ago when the crypto related banks were Bitcoin went up. Yeah. It really can be a diversifier. So I think that's one. You don't think that it's too, has too short of a history to call it a diversifier. It emerged after the financial crisis.

It doesn't mean that you dive in and hold your nose and just go to the bottom of the ocean. But think about, in the equity markets as well, think about the AI disruption.  You know, way back when, in the late 90s, there was this book called The Innovator's Dilemma. And it said that the thesis of The Innovator's Dilemma was that incumbent companies cannot take advantage of technological innovation because it screws up their cash cows. Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School, a legend who just passed away a few years ago. I didn't even realize that. Now, today, we got a lot of incumbents who appear to be  making a ton of coin off of this disruptive technology, which is entirely different than that thesis.

It's Thursday, the 17th of July in London. I'm Caroline Hepke. Coming up today, markets are rattled as President Trump floats the idea of firing Jerome Powell to lawmakers before denying he has any plans to do so.  Germany rejects the EU's 2 trillion euro proposed draft budget, calling plans for a significant hike in spending unacceptable. Plus, can the man who cleaned up Britain's banks fix the country's wildly unpopular and indebted water industry? We have a special report. Let's start with a roundup of our top stories.  President Trump is denying reports that he intends to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. That's after he is said to have raised the idea in a closed-door meeting with congressional Republicans that was then leaked to the press. Separately, the New York Times reported that Trump has a draft of Powell's termination letter, which was shown to lawmakers during the meeting. Bloomberg's Anne-Marie Hordern put that claim directly to the president in the Oval Office."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 78.972, "text": " So you didn't show a letter to Republican lawmakers last night?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 81.978, "text": "No, I talked about the concept of firing them.

But I'm more conservative than they are."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 92.725, "text": " President Trump added that while he doesn't rule anything out, he's highly unlikely to remove Powell unless there is evidence of fraud, in his words. The president then went on to make a series of unfounded claims about fraud related to the cost of renovating Federal Reserve buildings in Washington.  Now markets reacted sharply to the initial reports that Powell could be axed. Stocks, the dollar and long-term U.S. government bonds all retreated, while short-term treasuries rallied on speculation that a new Fed chair would cut interest rates. Those moves were quickly unwound as Trump walked back the reports.  But Bloomberg Economics says that they believe Trump is testing the markets to see whether he can fire Powell, and the sharp reaction appears to have convinced him to pull back on the firing rhetoric for now. It's a message echoed by our Markets Live stratheist Mark Ranfield.  The more that it gets talked about, particularly by President Trump, the more traders will have to take it seriously. And you will probably see those odds start to increase. Now, it may well be that Bloomberg Economics are right that Trump will be watching the market reaction. And if the market reaction is not too severe, then maybe that is the telling point that makes investors say, yes, this is a real possibility and it could happen sooner than later.  So everybody is watching the movements in the markets, the pricing odds in the futures and the betting markets as well. You put all those together and it's beginning to look like a case of no smoke without a bit of fire.  Mark Cranfield speaking there as Bloomberg Economics modeled what replacing power with a more dovish chair could mean for the U.S. economy. While making certain assumptions, the model found that removing the Fed chair could drive real U.S. GDP down by 0.6 percentage points by the second quarter of next year with an unemployment rate close to 5% and headline inflation CPI of around 3%.  Well, President Trump said that he would send letters to more than 150 countries, notifying them that their tariff rate could be 10 or 15 percent. In an interview with Real America's Voice broadcast later on Wednesday, Trump said that the rate was going to be the same for everyone for that group.  Trump added that the trading partners that would receive those letters were not big countries and they don't do that much business. Asked about the prospect of a deal with the European Union. Well, the president said that the US could make a deal possibly with Europe, but that he's very indifferent to it.  Let's think about bank earnings too today. J.P. Morgan is now worth more than its three largest U.S. rivals combined. The U.S. lender scored $30 billion of profit in the first half of the year, and it now has $1 trillion more in assets than any other U.S. bank.  It comes as American banks posted record earnings performances, with Goldman Sachs posting its best stock trading revenue in history. RBC Capital Markets Head of US Bank Equities Strategy Gerard Cassidy says you can put the record performance down to President Trump's Liberation Day.  We have to remember that the markets obviously drive, are a major factor behind the investment bank's trading revenues, and increased volatility is good for trading. It's not as strong for investment banking revenues, but for trading you want volatility, and we certainly had that at the start of the quarter.  Well, to Cassidy's point, trading revenue at the five biggest banks in the U.S. hit $71 billion in the first six months of the year, the most for that period ever. Opinions differed on whether it would last, though, with Goldman's CEO David Solomon saying that the coming quarters wouldn't be on the same scale, whereas Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser says that volatility will be a feature, not a bug, of the new world order.  Here in Europe, Germany has rejected the European Commission's \u20ac2 trillion budget proposal just hours after it was announced in Brussels. The seven-year plan is \u20ac800 billion larger than its predecessor as the bloc tries to fund support for European companies.

Let's think about the markets though. In terms of the volatile day that we had yesterday, the threats, the independence of the Fed, the dollar this morning is back to some gains, but that was hit hard yesterday after the flurry of speculation then denial from President Trump. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index this morning is up by 0.2%. The VIX Index also yesterday was above  at 19, given the repeated attacks on Powell. In terms of Treasury yields this morning, let's look to the 10-year yields, which are up almost two basis points at 4.47. The Fed's Williams talking about the restrictive stance of the central bank being entirely appropriate. Remember, European stocks yesterday dropped for a fourth session in a row, down 0.6% of 1%. There were some major names hit yesterday after results like Renault and ASML.  Looking to Asia, some gains, MSCI Asia Pacific Index is up currently 0.2%, U.S. stock futures are in the red right now. So, those are the markets. Well, in a moment, we'll discuss the threat to the Fed's independence from political interference and also a special report on Thames Water and the man being brought in to fix the U.K. 's faltering water industry.  But another story got my attention this morning as I got up before the bid men to be here in the studio. The era of bragging about how little sleep you get as a top executive is over. I must say I cheered at this. Kate Crader has been writing about the routines  that CEOs have for getting a good night's sleep. And this is in Bloomberg Businessweek's The CEO Diet. Well, she has Uber's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, pretty simple, get rid of the screens. He says he now falls asleep by reading. Yes. Wow, a book. It's back. Also, a long soak, Sam Calgioni, who is a founder of the craft brewer, Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. He apparently takes a half-hour-long bath before going to bed.  Daytime Nappers are in there too, Vita Coco's co-founder Michael Kerban. And then the estate agent to the rich and famous Rainie Williams, who co-founded Beverly Hills Estates, her list is enormous. Magnesium and zinc and an energy supplement and a long skincare routine. Anyway, it's a really good  read. So, I'm going to put a note and a link to that article in our show notes. Kate's story gives you, well, all of their financial vital statistics, none of the competition about sleeping being for wimps. So, a really nice story today.  Now, President Trump took his pressure campaign against the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to a new level yesterday, putting markets into a short-lived nosedive. Trump then denied a plan to imminently axe Powell, but he didn't rule anything out. Joining me now to discuss is Bloomberg's Markets Live strategist, Mary Nicola. Mary, good morning. Bloomberg Economics says that President Trump is testing the markets to see whether he can fire the Fed chair. Well, what was the market reaction in more detail?  There's been a lot of volatility. So obviously, we saw that the U.S. dollar was undermined. And then, of course, that we saw a steeper U.S. Treasury curve as a result. So clearly, the market is unhappy with some of these noises. And as long as the idea continues to get floated, I think that you'll still see a reaction that negatively, because what he's essentially doing is undermining the Fed's credibility. He's blurring the lines.  between fiscal and monetary policy, and that continues to be a cornerstone for the US. And so as long as these ideas continue to get floated and the market reacts negatively, that's going to be a key test for how long this goes. Now, if you look at the polymarkets,  The polymarkets are only pricing in about a 20% chance of Powell leaving by 2025. But again, it's going to start increasing if more of these noises come through, and that's going to increase volatility and undermine the dollar and steepen the yield curve. Okay. Fed independence absolutely critical, says JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon. Wall Street CEOs have been commenting on this situation, a lot of them. What have they been saying?  Yeah, absolutely. They've reiterated. Each one of them has said the same thing in terms of talking about the importance of Fed independence, Fed credibility, and not blurring those lines between monetary policy and fiscal policy. And the fact that how important it is for the Fed to take action based on what it sees available. So we already heard from Fed Williams saying that, you know, current policy is appropriate where it's  stands. And of course, you've had some CPI this week showing some bubblings in inflation. So clearly, there is an indication that they want to take a more measured approach to policy, whereas the administration, the Trump administration, clearly wants rates to move a lot lower at a much faster pace than what the Fed is thinking.  And of course, there still is a lot of uncertainty out there. So you don't know the risks, the impact of tariffs that's really coming through. And then, of course, you had an increase in fiscal spending as a result of the big, beautiful bill. So there's a few pockets that are bubbling. And of course, what these bank CEOs are saying is just the importance of the Fed credibility at such a time.  The other question is about whether the next Fed president influences the board. What are the risks around the Fed board being captured politically and the U.S. ends up with lower interest rates, which is what President Trump would like to see? I mean, we already know that the process to replace Powell is underway and his term is up in May next year.  Yeah, but the problem is it's going to be policy mismanagement. So if you end up having inflation expectations unanchored, which is one of the key jobs that the Fed is doing, or having extremely low rates,  when the economy is chugging along absolutely fine. And then there becomes an absolute mismanagement in the economy. And that's where investors become really, really nervous and jittery and could actually exacerbate what some of the key themes that we've seen where the cracks in U.S. exceptionalism and also the Sell America theme that we've noticed since the start of the year.  So it's a really fine and difficult line if that we start seeing that the Fed move in favor of political pressure rather than what is really being asked for by the economy and what needs to anchor growth and of course inflation.  Okay, Mary, thank you so much for being with me this morning. Very good to have you on the program. Bloomberg's Markets Live Strategist, Mary Nicola. So, I want to turn to a story here in the UK. The man who cleaned up Britain's banks, John Cunliffe, is set to reveal his plans to fix the country's wildly unpopular and indebted water industry. Joining me now is Bloomberg's Priscilla Azevedo-Rocca, who's been writing about this. Good morning, Priscilla.  Look, firstly, can you just tell us now how bad the crisis at Thames Water and really across the industry is in the UK?  The crisis with Thameswater is really bad. The companies in the process of renegotiating is huge that file that by now it's nearing 20 billion. It's looking to inject equity at the same time. This has been dubbed just to give some perspective. This has been dubbed as the biggest corporate recapitalization in Britain's corporate history.  So there's a lot of will into making this work. Could the creditors of the company which now are actually on things water they're negotiating a plan with water regulator off what in and in the company itself and the management of the company to do this recapitalization. But they are asking for a lot of concessions and these discussions have been really heated.  If they don't reach an agreement, there's a high risk on the table that this company will fall into the special administration regime, which is very similar to nationalization. So the stakes are very high at the moment. Yes.  Also the stakes are high and therefore when you read Sir John Conliffe's career, when you know about his career, he's held such a series of senior roles, I mean at the Bank of England, at the UK Treasury, as a government advisor over decades. What is his task now?  That's right, he's a very seasoned civil servant and he's been tasked by the UK government to look at the current system and make the system work. So from day one, they excluded nationalization, they excluded changes to the current price control mechanisms, which is established by the regulator that sets up how much companies are allowed to spend and invest and charge customers.  so basically he was brought in said okay this system is clearly not working what can we do what can we change to make it work without changing how things are structured and in this process in his findings and throughout his  Travels and when he talked to industry and he's entering report he indicated that he's looking particularly at the role of regulators which is very similar to what he has done in the post. Financial crisis person with the banks to have more accountability and he's also running on the right type of investors for the sector in that means attracting.  People that want to be there for a long time they want lower returns they want the sector to be boring again compared to what we have now which are investors that have a short.  time framework, that they are looking to extract returns, and that doesn't really work for this sector. Okay. What is the utility? It should be a sort of steady stream of income. I mean, critics have obviously blamed privatisation for allowing companies to extract profit.  at what they see as the expense of infrastructure. I mean customers are going to have to pay. This is partly the outcry over Thames Water and why it's been so politically significant and probably will stay that way.  Yes that's right. It's not only things water is across the country. Bills have gone up to a record high earlier this year in April. And the issue here is that we have very very old infrastructure that requires improvement. For years we had the political will to keep the bill lower to keep like household bills lower. There was this angle from the political side. And at the same time we had investors that extracted hefty  returns from being part of those companies. And that combination has put us where we are now. So we had years of underinvestment in a massive infrastructure that requires huge improvements. That is really really old. We had what is considered now what the market is viewing as the wrong type of investors for this type of assets."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "Unidentified SPEAKER", "start": 1206.098, "text": "And"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1206.138, "text": " and lower bills, which is also the political angle to this.

And that combination has put us where we are now, with climate change, with population growth, with water needs rising.  The UK regulator approved 104 billion of investment for all water companies combined for the next five years period. And that's the highest ever in history, which gives you a little bit of scope on how much is needed to improve the system, right? And we got to a point where we have all these three factors against it. So this bill comes at the end of the day.

You want to coordinate with violent criminals. I'm happy to partner with you. I've got the receipts. No, the governor could like claimed over 11,000 11,000 individuals. We've coordinated with ice since I've been covered, become governor of the state of California. Violent criminals. This is not about violent criminals. Quite the contrary.  So as it relates to the random nature, this indiscriminate nature, I hope the judge begins to rationalize that, this sort of racialization of these enforcements. I mean, Homan himself, talk about a tough guy. Homan himself, I mean, just talk about a self-inflicted wound. He said, yeah, on the basis we can do whatever we want, on the basis of how you look. In some cases, what car you're driving.  So that was a pretty obvious decision, the lower court. But what's no longer obvious is what happens at the appellate and obviously the Supreme Court. But I'm hoping it will rationalize some of this. And at peril again, you're gonna see this in other cities. And I worry about people's lives. I'm telling you, we're on the verge. This is serious. I mean, if someone just randomly, if I'm walking down the street with my kids and someone grabs me,  with a mask on and tries to throw me in an unmarked van. And I am looking at my kids. I'm surprised someone hasn't gotten hurt. Someone is going to get hurt. So the best thing that happened to this administration, maybe that they have to come to realization of what they're doing and change their tactics, even if they're not compelled to do so at the appellate level. I pray that's the case.  I'm not going there. And look, that gets hyperbolic. Yeah, I worry about that. And you got someone to drop 30 feet because they were scared to death and lost their lives. Farm worker. Yeah, I met that 16 year old kid. His mom and dad were disappeared after 20 years going to the same workplace, dragged out of their cars.  I met an 86 year old woman who, by the way, coincidentally in 1986 was able to get her citizenship. Yeah. And she said she literally had P. T. S. She was expressing and she's shaking as she was sitting there in a coffee short said when I heard the helicopters, it reminded me when I was kid and we used to learn how to hide in the baskets in the fields. She said that's what it felt like again.  despite Donald Trump saying we're not going after workplaces, we're not going after non-violent folks that are essential to our economic well-being. We're not going after farm workers.

As the House considers funding $831 billion to the Department of Defense for the funding of our great men and women in our military to defend our nation and our nation's interests, it's important to talk about the foreign aid that we are funding to foreign countries.  The American people are $37 trillion in debt. $37 trillion in debt. The debt keeps rising and the interest on our debt is at $1 trillion now per year. $1 trillion.  My amendment would strike 500 million of military assistance to Taiwan. This is an increase of 100 million from fiscal year 2025 and will be used to provide a wide variety of assistance, including planes, drones, missile defense, munitions, and more. The entire, listen to this, as we're giving an extra 100 million  making it $500 million in this Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, the entire defense budget of Taiwan is less than $20 billion. Our defense budget is $831 billion. It wouldn't be so high if we weren't giving foreign aid. We've given Taiwan over $2 billion in funding and munitions over the past two years. We've already given them $2 billion, but now we're giving them another $500 billion.  Increasing foreign aid to Taiwan will only increase their reliance on the United States. And the United States should be serving the American people and stop enslaving the American people in massive debt that drives the inflation that is causing Americans to suffer, that is causing Americans to not be able to afford everyday life.  The United States is $37 trillion in debt, and we can't even hardly afford our own massive military budget.  let alone funding the significant portions of other countries, of foreign countries, and foreign nations, and foreign people that do not pay taxes here in America. We have so many of our own domestic problems here at home and should not be funding foreign countries, foreign aids, and quite frankly, instigating World War III with China.  Before we start worrying about Taiwan's borders or Ukraine's borders or any other country's borders, we should be focusing on the continued security of our own border and deporting the criminals and terrorists and millions of people that invaded our country and are somewhere within our country after they invaded our own borders.

One of the very few areas the administration expressed any slight disagreement with our bill was wanting more money for Taiwan. The administration has proposed including $1 billion while this bill provides $500 million.  Now, had OMB delivered budget materials to us in time for consideration, we would have certainly taken a look at providing what they requested, but that wasn't the case. Supporting Taiwan in the face of unrelenting Chinese aggression is absolutely in the vital interest of the United States. I want to point out that Taiwan makes 90% of the world's chips and close to 100% of the highly  needed ships for artificial intelligence and high-technical devices. The funding will go a long way to make sure that Taiwan has the resources necessary to help prevent a Chinese invasion.

America's strength around the world does not only stem from our military power, but our network of alliances in Europe and the Pacific that allow us to project power. Our allies support us, and we support them.  That means when our allies are threatened, the United States needs to be with them. That's exactly what we're doing in Ukraine, helping sovereign nation defend itself against, defend its democracy from Russian aggression. A similar situation could easily occur in the Pacific, where Taiwan is threatened by the People's Republic of China. China has a recent history of seizing territory.  Look at the evasion of Tibet in the 1950s. They've suppressed democracy in Hong Kong. And when the Chinese president speaks of reunification of Taiwan, we should believe that he will attempt it. We cannot allow that to happen. China may not stop with Taiwan. If Taiwan falls, other Pacific island nations like the Philippines would be threatened.  And America is not alone in these concerns. Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand are deeply concerned about the future of Taiwan's democracy. And that's why they're working with us to deter China and to prevent innovation of Taiwan from happening. The $500 million in this bill will assist Taiwan in preparing their military, increasing their readiness and their deterrence capabilities.

The best way to compete with China is to have a strong American economy. We shouldn't be having to fund the protection of a foreign country that is producing over 90% of our chips, when we should be producing those chips right here at home.  Currently, many of our rare earth minerals are tied up on federal lands, and this is a problem that is tying up the production of chips here in America. You see, America should be building our strength and resilience. Instead of an additional, let's say an additional 500 million being given to Taiwan,  for their defense budget, we shouldn't be investing that $500 million into America's ability to produce chips so that we don't have to be the world's police that go defend all these other foreign countries from China's aggression. The best way to beat China is with a strong America.  But decades of America-last policies, where our manufacturing jobs were sent overseas and sent to China, is what made China strong. America created that problem, and America is continuing to create that problem by dependence on foreign countries for our own manufacturing. This is why rural America has been crumbling for decades, because of the economic loss of their own small towns.  In America today, the cost of college tuition has increased by over 180 percent. That means it's unaffordable for many students, and they're laden with student loan debt. According to American Compass, in 1985, 40 weeks of a typical worker's income could provide the middle class essentials for a family of four.

I apologize for our tardiness. I was with the President. Let me begin with a few scheduling announcements today. President Trump will travel to Scotland, where he will visit both Turnberry and Aberdeen from July 25th to July 29th. During the visit, President Trump will meet again with Prime Minister Starmer to refine the great trade deal that was brokered between the United States and the United Kingdom.  And the President and the First Lady will travel to the United Kingdom for an official state visit from September 17th to September 19th, later this fall. This will mark a truly unprecedented second state visit for President Trump, and he is honored and looking forward to meeting with His Majesty the King at Windsor Castle.  There has been a wave of positive economic news over the past week, which I would like to highlight today. Joe Biden's inflation crisis has been defeated. Prices paid to American businesses for goods and services were flat in June, which is lower than all 50 forecasters in the Bloomberg survey predicted. And core inflation, which is the best measure of inflation, came in lower than expected again in the month of June.  Since President Trump took office, core inflation has tracked at just 2.1 percent overall and has come in below or at economists' expectations every single month. Wages are growing at a strong pace and prices are falling for everyday Americans.  We also saw prices for new and used vehicles and airfares drop last month. In addition, prices for gas, fuel oil, energy commodities, hotels, airfare, public transportation and fresh vegetables are all down over last year.  As we said all along, trust in President Trump. The American Dream is back, and everyday families are already reaping the benefits of this incredible economic turnaround in just six months. President Trump has ended the era of economic surrender and implemented powerful tariffs to stand up for our workers and businesses and rebalance America's trading agreements.  Despite all of the doom casting from the so-called experts claiming that these tariffs would be the end of the world as we know it, the opposite has occurred. Tariffs are not inflationary, as President Trump has said all along. In reality, tariffs are a source of massive revenue. We're seeing trillions of dollars in private investment pour into our country right now because the companies around this world want to make their products right here with American labor and not have to pay any tariffs at all.  Customs and tariff revenue has already totaled more than $113 billion since President Trump entered office, helping to lead a budget surplus in June for the first time in nearly a decade. We are truly entering a golden age as a result of these pro-growth and America-first trade policies.  On another matter, yesterday in the East Room, the President was proud to sign the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act into law, surrounded by angel families, to help finally end the devastating fentanyl crisis that has ravaged millions of Americans.  Under the HALTS Fentanyl Act, anyone who possesses, imports, distributes, or manufactures any illicit fentanyl-related substances will be subject to criminal prosecution in the same manner as any other Schedule I controlled substance.  This legislation will close the loopholes that criminals use to skirt around the law and make it easier for law enforcement to prosecute vicious traffickers who peddle poison in our communities. President Trump has always made tackling the drug crisis a top priority, and this important bipartisan legislation further follows through on that commitment.  The complete and total success at our southern border that many in the media in this room continue to ignore is another example of the President keeping his word to families who have lost loved ones due to fentanyl, and it's another win for the American people. Customs and Border Protection just released the final operationalized stats for the month of June, and I must highlight some of these incredible numbers.  There were only 6,072 Southwest apprehensions in June, 15% lower than the previous record that this president set in the month of March. To put that in perspective, the Biden administration routinely saw the same number of encounters in a single day. And on many days, that number was more than 10,000 apprehensions at the Southwest border.  There were also zero illegal aliens released along the Southwest border for the second consecutive month in a row. President Trump promised to end the illegal alien invasion, and he has delivered on that promise to the American people in record time. With the border sealed, deportations are ramping up. This past weekend, our brave ICE agents were arresting violent criminal illegal aliens all across the country.  ICE Atlanta arrested an illegal alien from Mexico convicted of attempted rape of a child in North Carolina. ICE Baltimore arrested an illegal alien from Guatemala who was previously convicted for sexual abuse of a minor in Maryland. ICE Houston arrested a criminal illegal alien from Mexico whose previous conviction includes aggravated sexual assault of a child in Texas.  ICE Salt Lake City arrested a 32-year-old illegal criminal alien from Mexico who was previously convicted for child abuse and injury. ICE Baltimore arrested a criminal illegal alien from El Salvador convicted in Maryland for possession of child pornography. And ICE San Antonio arrested a criminal illegal alien from Mexico convicted of aggravated sexual assault in Texas.  The men and women of ICE are heroes. They are putting their lives on the line every day to get the worst of the worst, these types of criminals, out of our communities and out of our country. And the President continues to strongly have the backs of all ICE agents who are doing their jobs to keep all of us, including everyone in this room, safe.  In other news, following President Trump's bold executive actions protecting American children from irreversible chemical and surgical mutilation, the largest provider of these barbaric practices will now be closing its doors.  The facility in Los Angeles, California, is just the latest facility downsizing or eliminating their irreversible and harmful services that feed into the lie that you can somehow change a child's sex. The Biden administration peddled dangerous policies that defied medical science in favor of radical transgender ideology. But President Trump has put an end to that to ensure America's children's innocence is protected.  and our children can lead healthy and productive lives. Finally, last night, Senate Republicans passed President Trump's $9 billion rescissions package. This will help restore fiscal sanity in our country by rescinding billions in wasteful foreign aid and finally ending taxpayer funding for PBS and NPR.  two media organizations that have ridiculously used federal dollars to push a partisan left-wing agenda for many years. The House should pass this rescissions package immediately and send it to the President's desk for signature. On another note, I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the President's hand and also swelling in the President's legs. So, in the effort of transparency, the President wanted me to share a note from his physician with all of you today.  In recent weeks, President Trump noted mild swelling in his lower legs. In keeping with routine medical care and out of an abundance of caution, this concern was thoroughly evaluated by the White House Medical Unit. The President underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies.  Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70. Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.

All results were within normal limits.  An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart failure, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified. Additionally, recent photos of the President have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand.

It was this President who directed the Department of Justice and the Attorney General to do an exhaustive review of all files related to Jeffrey Epstein, which they did.

The President has been working so hard this week. On Tuesday, he went to Pennsylvania, where he secured $90 billion in investments for the Commonwealth, for the people of that state. After that, he came back to the Oval Office at 8 p.m. He went in there to whip votes to get the Genius Act signed into law.

Congresswoman Salazar introduced legislation that would give some illegal immigrants in the country a path to citizenship. Ten Republicans signed on to what she's calling the Dignity Act.  I'm curious what the White House's position is on the legislation and if the President would veto this bill if it made it to his desk. From my understanding, the White House, nor the President, has actually read through this legislation. We've been focused on, of course, the one big, beautiful bill, which passed, which is another historic accomplishment of this President in record time, the Genius Act this week, the rescissions package. That's been the focus of the White House. But the President has made it very clear he will not support amnesty for illegal aliens in any way.  I want to give you a chance to respond to the CEO of NPR. She's claiming that the cuts to their network will, quote, be a real risk to public safety of the country. Congressman Murkowski has argued that public broadcasting stations save lives. Could you respond to these concerns?  The NPR CEO said cutting NPR will be a risk to public safety. I am not sure how NPR helps the public safety of our country, but I do know that NPR, unfortunately, has become really just a propaganda voice for the left. Just a few examples for you. In 2020, NPR refused to cover  The Hunter Biden laptop scandal and the run-up to the election, they said their assertions don't amount to much, writing, they did not want to waste the listeners' and readers' time on stories that are just pure distractions. That does not sound like an unbiased opinion. That sounds like a partisan opinion to me. And this is a taxpayer-funded organization. In 2018, that same CEO that you're talking about called the president in the Oval Office, who nearly 80 million Americans elected, she called him racist.  shared a photo of herself wearing a Biden for President campaign hat, serves on the board of a Soros-funded activist group. In 2020, PBS's White House correspondent at the time characterized President Trump's speech then at Mount Rushmore as a love letter to white resentment promoting the myth of America. In 2017, PBS devoted an entire panel talking about what it means to be woke and white privilege. In 2023, PBS's Washington Week  Roundtable covered up Joe Biden's clear mental divine. That's actually quite the clip. I would encourage all of you to look at it. These are not honest news organizations. These are partisan, left-wing outlets that are funded by the taxpayers.

He talked about it a lot on the campaign, and I think he was quite surprised by the uptick we were seeing in the embracement by the Democrat Party when it comes to  the chemical castration and mutilation of young, innocent bodies. And so the President made it a very early priority to sign very strong executive orders to cut off the funding for any hospital or any medical facility in this country that provides such barbaric procedures.

The reality is we just don't have that many machinists, welders, or advanced skill sets in this country anymore. So what we do is build and run these advanced factories that make the workforce 10 times more productive and enable a much lower entry point. So we can train someone in 30 days and they're 10 times more productive instead of taking 10 to 20 years. And that's what we really need in this country is this quantum leap above China's manufacturing model where it's about supercharging the worker versus replacing them.  So yes, we are lucky enough to work with most of the large defense primes, neoprimes and startups, as well as part of this financing is launching these dedicated divisions to support the maritime and munitions industrial base where we are, frankly, a thousand to one behind China, which is a really important moment in time to go fix really fast."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 171.562, "text": "It's a super fascinating to me, especially when you start talking about this idea of bringing shipbuilding back to America.

In this era, it's not about automating jobs away, it's about using automation to enable 10 times more productivity.  The way we think about it is to leapfrog China here, it's all about the people. And we want our software powered factories to give people like an Iron Man suit so that you can get up and running in 30 days instead of 20 years from any background. 100% of our workforce now have never set foot inside a factory. You know, they're from Home Depot, they were a bus driver, they're a Marine. We feel like this is what the country needs is these advanced factories that are powering industries like shipbuilding, the submarine industrial base that are, as Secretary Phil had said,  years behind schedule and the number one problem is the American talent.

In manufacturing, you know, we need millions and millions and millions of skilled welders, skilled quality experts, skilled machinists, skilled technicians.  And we could train a million of these folks, but we can't train 10. And we need this productivity gain through AI, robotics, and software-powered factories to really help us get there at the start. I think you could give me a billion dollars and say, go hire a million machinists or a million welders, and it's just not possible because we destroyed the talent in this country for the last four decades. And upgrading the next generation of the workforce with AI and robotics, one, we just need to do it because there aren't  that level of skilled workforce left in the country. And secondly, manufacturing is the last job AI will ever replace. It's really about enabling and empowering versus destroying jobs. I think the second point is, when we de-industrialized, we lost 80% of the manufacturing revenue offshore. And if we can get more productive in the country, what that will create is  10 times more new jobs as that volume comes back on shore and the productivity of the country ramps back up.

I think the biggest challenge our country is going to have is making these big bets on national champions.

I don't think we're there yet, and we have to do a lot more, a lot faster, but certainly we're able to keep up with the scale right now, and grateful to our team and customers for letting us go and do that.

And now he's in our company running 10 machines at once with all these advanced things and working with software engineers. I don't think the country has realized what advanced manufacturing can look like as a cool job. You know, one of the biggest problems that we've got culturally is your dad lost their job in manufacturing in the nineties. So you told your son or daughter to go get a four-year college degree.  At Hadrian, people understand this. It's an awesome place to work, we think. People have really advanced skill sets and get to work on the national mission. As a country, I think we need to wake up and recognize that these new factories and new jobs are a far sight better than the jobs of old and certainly what we see in China, but I really think we have to reinvigorate the culture about the skilled trades and that you don't need a four-year college degree to earn a lot of money or be really successful in this country."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 20, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 541.465, "text": " So are you developing the software and the hardware that's on these factory floors?

At Hadrian, we have the largest set of trained labelled data in manufacturing anywhere in the world, is my belief.  And that will enable us to get better and better with our AI models over time as we scale faster and faster, we've got more data. But because manufacturing has been offline for 30 years, you really need software powered factories to capture that in the first place. So that as we scale, the system keeps improving.

Let's go AI first in manufacturing and re-show all this volume and not worry about whether we're going to lose jobs because we don't have the skilled workforce.

And we may not be overweight NVIDIA anymore, where it's a 6% weighting in our portfolio. It's still pretty large after trimming it. Microsoft still 5% weighting in our portfolio. But then we also have names like Broadcom at a 5% weighting.  So it's really, how do you put that piece of pie together? And we trim those, too.

The only one worse this year, Joe mentioned, is Tesla. The trouble with Apple is that it's still a 33 times trailing PE.  My comment to that would be the market doesn't seem to care. It's been an expensive PE for most of the last two years. I think the reason why the market is giving it that premium is not because they're delivering earnings growth. It's because someday they will again. So that's kind of like a bet that they're going to get their earnings growth story back together.

President Trump says Coca-Cola will be updating its American ingredients list. That news coming in a Truth Social post from the president, who is a noted fan of Diet Coke. He said, I've been speaking to Coca-Cola about using real cane sugar and Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so. He added, it's just better.  U.S. Coca-Cola is made with high-fructose corn syrup, at least as best as we know. It is a secret recipe. Archer Daniels Midland is one of the biggest producers of that ingredient. The shares for Archer Daniels are down by about 5.7 percent, much lower in the pre-market. When asked later yesterday about the president's claim, Coke didn't explicitly say that it would make that switch to cocaine sugar. In a statement, the company said,  We appreciate President Trump's enthusiasm for our iconic Coca-Cola brand. More details on new innovative offerings within our Coca-Cola product range will be shared soon. So if you're reading through the corporate speak here, it sounds to me like, oh my gosh, he made public comments that we were making to him kind of privately with maybe something we're planning. I would almost wonder, based on that statement, if they're just going to do  a different line of Coke that says pure cane sugar and keep the old stuff there too. In fact, they go on to say that they're thinking about introducing something called New Coke. Do you remember that? Yes. It was during the Cola Wars with Pepsi. Pepsi. Yeah.

The highest profile candidates so far include Kevin Hassett, current director of the White House's National Economic Council, who you may know from our interviews over the years, including one just this Monday.

Becky kicks things off.  Kevin, we are very glad to have you here with us this morning. Becky, it's great to be with you. It's a slow, lazy summer day on a Thursday. I don't know what could possibly be on your mind. By the way, we booked you before a lot of the blowup that came yesterday with what was happening. But you are here, and you are somebody who has been mentioned on the short list for people who would be headed to the Fed. We've thought that for a long time. We've had people like Ken Langone, who was here earlier this week, talking about how  He is a huge fan of yours. I just wonder what you're thinking right now where you see things. Well, I think Ken's a great man. He's an American hero. I came to know him when I started to work for Druckenmiller about 15 years ago. And I talked to him all the time, and I usually ask him what's going on in the real economy. Almost everything he touches turns to gold. And over the last six months, every month, he would just sound a little bit more positive about what was happening. And he told me something's happening out there that's different.  And I said to him once, I might sound a little like Joe, I said, why aren't you more supportive of the president then? This is because of policy. And I think, listen, my sense is that we're at the forefront. We're at a transformational moment in US economic history.  This is, as George Shultz told me before he passed, a hinge point in history. I think the president's language is this could be a golden age. And frankly, I think they all could be right. Good policies could advance this US economy, what we call AI. In a couple of years, we'll just call business. And AI is going to make almost everything cost less. And the US can be a big winner. That's my argument to Ken. I think Ken's now come on to the president's side. That's what he said when he was here.  And it's a hugely exciting moment. If I were to step back for a minute, if I were the president, what I'd be worried about is a central bank that doesn't see any of that. A central bank that is stuck with models from 1978, governance from a prior period, and don't recognize we could be at the front end of a productivity boom.  And if I were the president, I'd be worried that they might not see it. And they might think economic growth is somehow going to be inflationary. I think we were probably in the early innings of a structural decline in prices. Ken sees it on the front lines of real businesses. And I think if you look over the period of the next year or two, it's a pretty special moment. We've been talking today about how  far the Fed should forecast, how predictive they should be, if they should be dependent on data that's coming in. And there's one school of thought that says it would be better to have somebody who sees this and can anticipate in advance. That's what great money managers do. But great money managers don't always get it right either. We spoke earlier with Nick Timmeros, who made the point that, look, sometimes it's better to wait so that if there is a mistake, you can recalibrate much more quickly.  So I heard a little bit about that interview, and I heard Nick say something like, well, what we need is continuity. My goodness, I think that's the last thing that we need. The broad conduct of monetary policy has been broken for quite a long time. The central bank that sits there today is radically different than the central bank I joined in 2006.  I don't think we need policy continuity that brought about the greatest mistake in macroeconomic policy in 45 years, that divided the country, that caused a surge in inflation. I don't think we need continuity when the central bank doesn't have credibility. Last September, Becky, as you'll recall, the Fed cut interest rates 100 basis points.  50 basis points before the election, 50 basis points after. Inflation was 50% higher then than it is now. And what did the bond market do when they cut rates? Long rates went up 75 basis points. That's a credibility crisis. So listen, this isn't the first time you've heard me in the last decade say we need regime change at the Fed.  It's not just about a person. It's about an approach to economics. It's about approach to what they're doing. And I'm troubled when I see them moving the goalposts. It is very puzzling to me, Becky, how you could think that we should do emergency rate cuts last September, and now all of a sudden you stand there like a hawk. That's not good for the institution. I don't think it's good for the economy to be changing the goalposts like that. Let me ask you, as somebody who's been there before, how much power slash influence  the chair ultimately has, if you're in a room with 11 other voting individuals who may not agree with that person. Historically, there's been sort of an alignment. Everybody's tried, I think, to come to a unanimity on most things. And whether you think that the Fed, I don't know if in history there have been times where there's been complete and utter  distinctions between views on the Fed and what it ultimately means. So there have been exactly those times. Paul Volcker, when he came in, not only have 12 years of experience in government and six at the Fed, I've got some knowledge of Fed history. Paul Volcker came in and said, we don't need continuity. We need regime change. And it was that regime change that brought inflation back.  and reestablish the Fed as this beacon of credibility. But the president at the time put in some members under the Volcker team afterwards that forced what some thought would be a coup. It hasn't always been pretty. In fact, my own view, Andrew, is what the Fed needs is more robust discussion of ideas.  Less groupthink. I don't like it that everyone's following the same models. To give you just one simple example, the dominant models at the Fed, which might have been the best models there were in 1978, what do they think, Andrew? They think inflation comes if the economy runs too hot and workers get paid too much.  That's not my view. I think we could use a new idea, a new theory of inflation, so let me practice one for you. Inflation happens when the government prints too much, spends too much, and lives too well. That theory, that theory that money has something to do with monetary policy, is nowhere in the central thinking of the Fed. I think if those ideas were imported into the discussion, we could have a good family fight about it. But you don't get to decide how much is spent. That's up to Congress and the  The president has to sign off on those things. Would you support them? And I guess the biggest question, Kevin, is people are wondering the next Fed chairman.  Is he going to be independent? Is he going to say, and I say he because right now the candidates that we're hearing are all men, is he going to be independent? Is he going to do what he thinks is right despite what the White House may advise or think, what the administration thinks? So in a word, yes. So I've strongly believed for 20 years and history tells us that the independent operations in the conduct of monetary policy is essential.  But that doesn't mean the Fed is independent in everything else it does. In fact, if I look at the track record of the Powell Fed over the last six or seven years, they've tried to say, how dare you be critical of us? We're independent in everything. Well, that's nonsense.  They wandered into climate change, a subject upon which they have no comparative advantage. With a change of administration, they said, just kidding. They wandered into another political area of which they were never assigned, diversity, equity, and inclusion. They changed the remit that Congress gave them about whether they were in the business of full employment or full inclusive employment.  This change in their definition in 2020 is one of the key reasons why we had the great mistake, the great inflation. And on spending, Becky, during the period of the last administration, what did they say to Congress? Spend, spend, spend. So like you, I think they should stay in their lane. But it's very strange to me that they're asymmetric.  Spend a bunch of money when it's popular. And now if you get asked about spending constraint, what does the leadership of the Fed say? Oh, no, that's not about us. You should establish what the rules of the road are and stick with it, regardless of the administration. I think the Fed has done a very good job of blaming others for their mistakes.  It's been very popular to blame the president because he's being so mean to them. Well, most of the Fed's mistakes are because of choices they've made. They've done a very good job in the business of politics. The inflation, that has done huge harm to the American people. First, they blamed Vladimir Putin. It was because of the war.  Then what did they do next? They blamed the pandemic. Supply chains, they would say. Well, supply chain was legit for a lot of inflationary. Well, it changed the level of prices because that's what happens in a market economy. But that's not what inflation is. Inflation is what happens to the Fed. The Fed is responsible for inflation. The Fed makes a choice about inflation. And the problem is the Fed has made that choice poorly.  So they've got someone new to blame for all these mistakes, and a lot of their co-conspirators in the media seem to believe it. The new mistake is the reason why they're not doing the right thing on rates is because of the president and those tariffs."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 23, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 1526.673, "text": "He's being so mean to them. I will say, changing the goalposts."}, {"keywords": ["Trump", "Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 24, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1529.318, "text": "But that's not the cause of inflation. The Fed controls that. The changing of the goalposts that you mentioned earlier, where the Fed cut  50 basis points right before the election, 50 basis points right after the election. What was different was we have a new president, a new administration, and the tariffs came in. And I think even you, back in January, in your op-ed piece for the Washington Post, pointed out that, look, the Fed's job is to make sure that the tariffs don't turn into an inflationary pressure.  I think that's right. I believe that. But here's what's happened. The Fed now says, well, we'll make a decision about interest rate cuts depending on whether prices of goods in the next month or two go up. Well, what that's really saying is they must be doubting their own inflation-fighting credibility.  If they were a very credible central bank, they could say, we're looking past this one-off change in prices. And so their hesitancy to cut rates, I think, is actually quite a mark against them. It's as if they've lost some of the credibility.  and inflation, bygones are not bygones, Becky. The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it is stuck with them. So one of the reasons why the president I think is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy. And I hear from Andrew, I heard from another speaker that was on, well, will the new Fed chairman, regardless of who it is, will he have credibility because the president's being so mean and pushing them around?  the credibility deficit lies with the incumbents that are at the fed in my view  Well, let me ask you a related question then. So we saw yesterday David Solomon, we also saw Brian Moynihan came on and they said, look, the independence of the Fed is critical. The market, the global investing community needs to believe that whoever's running the Fed and everybody involved in it is independent from the president. That's conceptually, do you agree with that idea? And then if that's true, and this is a sort of very interesting sort of behavioral science sort of experiment,  To some degree, whoever gets this job is going to obviously be appointed by the president, so they're connected to them in some way. But at the same time, as Nick was saying, and maybe you'll disagree with Nick, Nick said that that person needs to somehow demonstrate to the market that they're independent of the Fed. Otherwise, they won't have the credibility. So I hate to agree with Nick, but I guess I have to agree on one small part here.  The good news is I have a track record. I have a track record going back 20 years, including in the darkest days of the financial crisis at the Fed. The track record makes me understand who's really talented at the Fed and who do we need to elevate and who is sort of holding on to 1978 models who we need to relegate. Credibility comes through tough times.  In the 2008 financial crisis books that you wrote about with all this outrage, I can't find anyone at the Fed who was more aggressive in trying to get to the bottom of that and pushing radical new things that you might even describe as dovish. And the 2020 pandemic came.  there was uh... huge shutdown of the economy a month before chairman powell in the group over there said well maybe we should be cutting rates i spoke and wrote vociferously that the u s should be leading an international effort to cut rates they were slow there  In 2018, Jay Powell and his band of brothers put out dots that they were going to continue to raise rates through a market meltdown. I said they were out of their minds. They ended up cutting. So I think experience does help.  uh... experience means there are times to be dovish in times to be hawkish i'll give you one example of a time to be hawkish uh... twenty twenty one twenty twenty two interest rates were zero the fed was buying a hundred billion of assets every month payrolls were going up by five hundred thousand congress was spending five trillion and what did this group say this group then said it's all transitory  I don't know. There's a time for a bird to change his feathers, and it's with the times. It has nothing to do with who's president. If anyone ever said just shut up, listen and learn that, because that's I said that to myself before you started. But, you know, for anyone, oh, Kevin wants to cut rates now because he wants a job. I mean, you just put out a sort of a dissertation on what your feelings are that totally.  For me, at least, you explained yourself fully. I don't know if you get the job, but after listening to that, I'm ready to at least say you should be seriously considered. That was a masterclass. Well, listen, I appreciate it, but this isn't actually about one person. This isn't about getting a job. I mean, what I just harangued Andrew about, that might be the greatest hits. These have been my views since the beginning of time. The classic thing, Kevin, is President Trump  Whatever his reasons are, he wants to cut rates. It could be because he's a real estate guy. But somehow you two arrive at kind of the same conclusion, maybe from totally different places. But if you're right, you're right. I'll say two things about that. One is we created the second monetary instrument called quantitative easing in the darkest days of the oil financial crisis. It's a second monetary policy tool.  When we created it, we had cut rates to zero, so we said, we're going to start buying all these bonds and all these mortgages from Fannie and Freddie. Now, if you listen to the Powell Fed, they say, oh, that big balance sheet, that has nothing to do with monetary policy. The real reason why we can begin reform at the Fed with a rate cut  which is just the first step to regime change, is if you look outside this window, financial markets, financial conditions, they are hot. IPO markets are back. Credit spreads are narrow. SPACs are back. Financial conditions are very loose here.  What about the real economy? It's the real economy I talked to Ken Langone about. We're near a housing recession. Real households, first-time homebuyers, small businesses, they're having a hard time getting credit. So at the same time, what can we do? Take a little of this looseness out of financial markets by getting the Fed out of the fiscal business, out of the political business.  shrink that, and then redeploy some of that liquidity to people that need it most in the real economy. I think the Fed has the balance wrong. A rate cut is the beginning of the process to get the balance right. A strong real economy is what we need. So this can be a golden age.  You know, I was thinking about what you said about AI and the productivity gains we're expected to see and why that is part of the reason. And it reminds me of the other side of the Fed's mandate, which is full employment. Do you worry that the productivity gains that we see in AI will lead to a much weaker jobs market? You look at Microsoft or any of these companies that are talking about how they can do a lot of this work with fewer people at this point.  Yeah, so the amazing thing about this revolution, I think, is it's coming very quickly. In that ways, it's a little different than the internet or cloud or even the combustion engine. Yeah, far different than the industrial revolution.  So I'm very open-minded about the speed of the change here. But I'll say something else. I think humans are underrated. I think humans have this incredible adaptability. If you look at the things that we all call work, 50 years ago they wouldn't have considered any of this real work. What will be real work in 10 or 20 years will be different.  There's a thing that bothers me about this speed of the transition. It's not that the U.S. will fall behind. The U.S. is going to be at the forefront of this. The relative growth between the U.S. economy and the economies around the world will widen. The president is right. The U.S. will be a big winner. My own judgment is this will be America's century again because of these policies and because these technologies are born here. I think that's all true. But if you said to me, what's a lagging worry?  Technology is moving up and to the right. The K through 12 education system is moving down and to the right. We need to make sure that these tools can be plugged into the most talented young people, regardless of where they are, so that they can achieve great outcomes. And the educational system, I would say, is an Achilles heel. It's why the work that Secretary McMahon and others are doing are so essential.  I agree with your point that quantitative easing has seen its time and its moment. If you shrink the balance sheet quickly and really push things back to where they were before all of this, there's still a question of what that means for credit availability and what that does to the economy in term two. This is an experiment we're still trying to figure out how to get out of and what the impacts are.  Yeah, so I totally agree, Becky. If you did any of these things quickly, regime change in policy shouldn't be done overnight. Quantitative easing, all this Fed purchases, we did in a dark weekend when we were making things up. And I would argue was very necessary at the time. And so do I. We had an exit plan in 2010 and 2011 that once I left the Fed, they sort of forgot about. So there needs to be an exit plan to get the Fed out of the fiscal business.  to give powers back to Secretary Besant and to the President and Congress on fiscal policy. But it can't be done in a rushed way. It has to be done deliberately. So I'll just make this up. We need a new Treasury-fed accord like we did in 1951, after another period where we built up our nation's debt and we were stuck with a central bank that was working at cross-purposes with the Treasury.  That's the state of things now. So if we have a new accord, then the Fed chair and the Treasury secretary can describe to markets plainly and with deliberation, this is our objective for the size of the Fed's balance sheet. The Treasury can say, this is our issuing calendar. And by the end of, let's say, this administration, we'll be at an equilibrium rate on the balance sheet so that markets will know what is coming. None of this should be rushed.  But that would not, just to follow up on this, that would not be working in conjunction with the administration. It would be working with Treasury on goals that the Fed, it thinks, are important to try and pursue and how you would present that to the markets as such. Well, it would be in conjunction, but here's a distinction that my friends at the Fed don't make.  What we talk about independence, this is the independence and the operations of monetary policy. QE and QT is part monetary and part fiscal. And it is there that we have to work in concert. The reason why I think the Fed is in such hot water isn't because of buildings and isn't because the president's mean. It's because they've wandered outside of their remit and they dare to say anyone who criticized them is criticizing independence.  The Fed's a powerful institution, but it's a narrow institution. And when it decides to spread its wings, it intrudes on other parts of the Constitution, other parts of our government. We've got to take a break. We're going to come back with you in a minute.

Don't answer the question. He'd feel horrible about it. He wants to be the guy. I know, but one of the things he's talking about is the Accord.  Stick around. Will this potential candidate for Fed chair answer that question? Credibility is the coin of the realm. If the same person is in both of those jobs, you're going to have a bit of a credibility deficit. We'll be right back. You're listening to Squawk Pod.  Up and Andrew, cue. I want to get back to Kevin Warsh with the question that we just asked, which was around this idea that, and you talked about an accord between the Treasury and the Fed, which raised it in my mind, this speculation just last week that potentially Secretary Besant could also become the head of the Fed at the same time, and what that would portend. So I don't know if I'm supposed to say this on air, but I love Scott. I think Scott's doing a great job.  He and I have a similar pedigree. We both worked for the finest investor in the world in Stan Druckenmiller. So if you're going to try to goad me into saying something bad about Scott, I simply can't do it. That's not the intent at all. I think he's doing a great job, and I think he's serving the president well. The question is whether you think that the same individual, not whether it's Scott or somebody else, could do both of those jobs, and what that would mean to this whole independence concept, and how people will feel about this accord, even, idea in that context.  Well, it would make the accord easier if the same person was on both sides of it. But listen, I guess I'd describe it to you this way. When I was a kid and I went to the Fed 20 years ago as a governor, I went downtown to see Paul Volcker, who was the great man. I think I brought my autograph book. I was so excited to meet him. I was a child to become governor. I asked him these narrow questions about the Fed.  and he said i can listen all support you all tell the democrats that you're gonna be fine but the job of being chairman of the fed is two things it's one you gotta get interest rates about right into he said you gotta make sure you look like you know what you're doing my view  is the group that's there. They're well-intended, I am sure. There's huge amounts of talent. They haven't had interest rates about right for a long time. And they don't really look, as they change goal posts, like they have control and a deep understanding of what's going on. Credibility is the coin of the realm. If the same person is in both of those jobs, you're going to have a bit of a credibility deficit, the kind of credibility deficit that the Powell Fed has right now. So what I'd rather have  are two people that understand that we have one government, that interest rates are part of it. The Fed has operational independence for that narrow area. And we work together seamlessly because we are on the verge of this transformational moment. And these two people can be on the same team, even if one of them is independent interest rates. The last really effective chairman of the Fed that we had was who?  So, God, you're asking me to pick which. I'll say this. I'm just asking you to go back about four of them to get there."}, {"keywords": ["Trump"], "line": 29, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 2420.655, "text": "All right."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 30, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 2420.996, "text": "Well, let me say this. Greenspan? I don't know if this is in my interests or against. Ben Bernanke in The Darkest Days of the Financial Crisis was brilliant. And here's the thing he did that I thought was impressive.  He put the likes of me and Tim Geithner and Don Cohn in his room, and we disagreed then and now about everything, and he wanted to hear us fight it out, and then he would decide. So during the darkest days where we're making stuff up, he broadened the discussion instead of narrowed it. Here's another thing he did in the crisis period. He was humble about what we know.  No silly dots and silly forecasts. No placing blame on other people. No taking responsibility. And I know it's very common now to say the problem is the president's being so mean to these guys. Most of these Fed's problems are because of Fed mistakes. The Fed needs to stop defending their mistakes and vindicating their critics and get on the right track. I'm a Fed guy, Joe. I think it can be fixed. It was a great institution. And to use a cliche, I think it could be great again.  You're going to stick with us for one more second? I'm sorry. I need a letter from Becky addressed to Stan that says, Mr. Druckenmiller, I'm sorry Kevin is late for work today, but we didn't let him leave. We're going to do that now. He's watching. He's seeing the letter. We'll wrap things up with Kevin Ward.  Philosophically, so you like Bernanke in those dark days. I think Greenspan almost reached the level of demigod, but one person almost, the Mount Rushmore of Fed chiefs was Paul Volcker in your view? Paul Volcker reestablished  fed credibility after it had been squandered after a bad period of economic policy and inflation in the 1970s. That needs to happen again. I need to just put in a final word for Alan Greenspan. Alan Greenspan was a deft and effective chairman who kept the Fed in its lane and didn't wander out of its lane. Part of the reason why he was successful, he knew the Fed was powerful, but it wasn't all powerful. And he worked with governments regardless of who was in the White House to make a stronger economy.  And as I said off camera, you don't like a lot of guidance. When Alan spoke, he said a lot, but you never know what the hell the guidance was anyway, because he was so good at being sort of... Inscrutable? Inscrutable. But that's the way it fed. It's best when a leader of an organization doesn't reveal all the things they don't know.  Strategic ambiguity. If you don't know, it's better not to look silly with a bunch of forecasts that will turn out to be true. Keep your cards a little close to your vest, and make sure when you speak it matters, because I'll end with where we began. Fed credibility is everything. It's more important, even than the printing press. We got 20 seconds. Should the president fire Jay Powell? You're going to send me off with that, Joe?  Do you think he will? I'm not in the politics business. That's why I tried to stay to central banking. I think that regime change at the Fed will happen in due course. In due course.

And they set targets for the number of EVs that they want to be selling. And manufacturers of these EVs, such as Tesla, get carbon credits. They get these credits that they can then sell on to higher polluting car manufacturers, permitting them to sell more of their polluting vehicles.  in that 7.1 billion profits it made in 2024, we found over 38% were from carbon credits that are being traded at the state level. So that's kind of our floor for what we understand Tesla just last year made from subsidies.

And for a Model Y Tesla, which was their biggest selling model, the one that just overhauled, that's about $45,000 on the road in the US.  it's just got 16% more expensive, nearly 17% more expensive, because that's gone. Now, that also applies to every BMW, every Ford electric vehicle. Every electric vehicle suffers from this. But if you took about 630,000 Teslas sold in the US last year, if all of them benefited from the tax credit, and you've got to assume most people would, that's worth nearly $5 billion in discounts that Tesla wouldn't be able to offer otherwise without paying for it themselves.

So that's the, if you go to the fundamental level,  Tesla's just got more expensive for everybody in America. The part about those state-level credits, which are meant to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, the beauty of them for a company like Tesla, you get a credit for every electric vehicle you make.  to try and hit a certain proportion of the total sales. If you're Tesla, you don't make anything but EVs. So that is free money. And you can then sell them to General Motors, to Ford, if they're not hitting their targets. As someone once put it, these kind of credits, when it comes to saving carbon, you pay someone else to go on the diet for you. You've got this free reserve of money, and it makes up over a third  of their profits. So these are really, really important.

Its valuation is nearly 200 times what it earns. Ford, which makes all sorts of cars, is nine times what it earns. NVIDIA, which is the AI growth stock,  is only 50 times.

And certainly, just on the reconstruction, I'll come to the arms, but just think about that.

Good morning. Thanks so much for starting your Thursday with us. I'm Savannah Sellers. Joe is off this morning. We're going to begin with those severe summer storms that we are continuing to track across the country. In the Midwest, people are cleaning up toppled trees and debris this morning after at least five tornadoes tore through southern Wisconsin yesterday. Take a look at this. I got a tornado right in front of me. Tornado right in front of me. Right here, right here. Tornado on the ground. Tornado on the ground.  Holy ****! I got it! As you can hear, though, these massive twisters stunned storm chasers. Meanwhile, in the Northeast, one man died and 13 others, it includes kids, were injured yesterday after they were struck by lightning. It happened during a Cub Scout event at an archery range in New Jersey. Well, the severe storm risk is slightly lower today, but we are still watching out for heavy rainfall, in fact, up to 10 inches, and that could trigger flash flooding in states along the Gulf Coast.  We, of course, have Andrew Lassman here tracking it all for us. But first, let's go to NBC News correspondent George Solis. He's in New Orleans, which is being threatened by a tropical storm. George, good morning. The rain here in New Orleans and surrounding region expected to come in waves. Now, this system isn't expected to develop into a tropical storm or depression, but it's still expected to bring a lot of tropical moisture. And what that means, intense rainfall and the potential for some flooding. Now, some areas in Louisiana and around the region could see up to 10 inches. So residents here  Of course, on high alert, what we've seen are a number of businesses putting sandbags out in front of their businesses. We saw a number of people also collecting sandbags from a number of regions around New Orleans and surrounding parishes regions here. People not taking any chances.  Outside of that, this storm expected, again, to be a downpour. It could move very fast. A lot of folks keeping their eye on the forecast. Elsewhere in other parts of the country, tragedy struck. One man dead, more than a dozen injured after a lightning strike in New Jersey. We're getting more information about that particular incident right now. Unfortunately, some more details looking to be forthcoming here in the next several hours. The other big headline today is that intense  heat. More than 70 million people under those heat alerts. So hydration, hydration, staying indoors as much as possible. And of course, we cannot talk about weather without some of those severe twisters that we've been seeing ramp up, particularly around the Midwest. We saw some yesterday, some of those images completely harrowing of those twisters just  ripping through the sky across several towns. Some more assessment of those tornadoes expected today, but back here in Louisiana again the storm here set to make landfall if you will in the next several hours. We're looking at again some rain starting to fall now and again it's supposed to ramp here ramp up here throughout the day again as much as 10 inches in some regions and folks here definitely bracing for whatever this storm brings. Back to you.  All right, George, thank you. Well, let's get to meteorologist Angie Lesman. She is tracking that tropical disturbance along the Gulf Coast for us this morning. Hey, Angie, good morning. Hi there, Savannah. Good morning to you. George got it right when he said that we're going to see some heavy rainfall and the potential for flash flooding here in the coming days. It's not just a today problem along the Gulf Coast. It's going to be multiple days of this. So ample amounts of rain are on the way. Here's the lay of the land of what we're dealing with right now.  The system really can't get its act together. We're talking about just a 30% chance of any development. So right now we're looking at it to be fairly unlikely for this to develop into a tropical depression or anything beyond that. But that doesn't mean it's not going to be impactful when it comes to the weather that it brings across this region. Here's what we're looking at and how it times out as we get through the day today. Notice some of those showers that are focused across essentially the panhandle of Florida back to the west over Louisiana.  Louisiana is where we'll see some of that heaviest rain. It looks like this system will kind of stay spinning right near that central Gulf Coast. So that's where most of the heaviest of the rain will be. And then tomorrow, more of the same again across that same region. Galveston, Texas, back to the east towards Pensacola is where we'll see the potential for flooding with additional rainfall on the way here, even as we get into tomorrow. By the time we get through the weekend, specifically Saturday, it looks like we'll pick up a  a good dose of rain across this area. So I think more widespread amounts an inch, two inches, three, maybe up to five inches. But there's going to be some localized spots, especially the closer you get to the coast, where we could see anywhere from 10 to 15 inches of rain. So really concerned about the flash flooding across that region over multiple days heading into the weekend.  Bigger picture look. We've got a cold front that we're tracking across the east in the northern tier of the country. Scattered showers today from Ohio Valley all the way to New England. We'll see kind of a lower threat of severe weather but some gusty winds and heavy rainfall on the table once again across that area. And then tomorrow we'll see some of those showers and thunderstorms focused across the southeast and more of that rain across parts of the Midwest.  When it's all said and done, an inch or two across this region, not quite as concerned, Savannah, about the flash flooding in this area, but of course, multiple days of rain on the way along the Gulf Coast. All right, Angie, thank you so much. So much going on. Now let's turn to the White House. President Trump is now downplaying reports that he's been planning to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. So markets initially dropped, this was yesterday, after a White House official said the president would likely soon fire Powell. And this was after he received support  for that move from GOP lawmakers following a meeting on Tuesday. They said he asked them about it. What do you think? Should I fire him? They all said yes. Well, markets then rebounded after Mr. Trump, who's, of course, long criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates, denied that he was planning to oust the Fed chair.

But first, let's talk about how this all unfolded from that meeting I mentioned where the president sort of sourced opinions on if he should fire him to then these comments saying it's not happening. Is the door still open to fire, pal? What do you think?  Right. This is something that the president has floated now for months. His ire for Jerome Powell is only increased with the passing of time, with the Fed refusing to largely lower interest rates. And that is what has led the president to go behind closed doors with Republican lawmakers back on Tuesday afternoon.  and tell them that he was considering firing the Fed chair. But that's when, less than 24 hours after that, you heard there from the president directly saying that it's highly unlikely that he will. That said, there's a Republican Florida lawmaker who was in the meeting there with the president.  who said that she was told that it was 99% imminent that he was going to go through with this here. So there's a lot of back and forth between the president, will he or will he not? But if he were to do this, the stakes of it would be sky high.  Caleb, let's bring you in here and just talk through why the president wants this potentially. Like, he's said verbally so many times how he wants them to lower those interest rates. Of course, that has not actually happened. You have told us that you're not predicting it will happen. Why is it that he wants that? Why is it that the Fed won't do it?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 551.557, "text": " Yeah, two reasons.

That would free up more money for the Trump administration to pursue  whatever they want with that money.

So we heard it there in that sound that we played, and there was a lot more of it in this press conference from the Oval Office yesterday of the President criticizing this planned $2.5 billion building renovation project, saying, you know, they don't need parks on the ceilings of buildings, things like that.  Is this considered controversial? And also, specifically the fact that he used that word fraud yesterday was kind of throwing something new in there, I think, a little bit, where it's like this potential, if he wants to, there could be cause to potentially fire the Fed chair. Tell us about this.  Right. Number one, the Fed denies that their construction project of their Washington headquarters is going and ultimately building things like garden rooftop terraces or having new slabs of marble throughout it or a VIP dining room. They deny what the White House is claiming as part of this construction project.  There's a legal question as to whether the president can actually fire the Fed chair. Just this spring, the Supreme Court suggested that the president did not have the power at will to fire Jerome Powell. And so that is where you are seeing sort of a pretext being laid by Russ Vought, his OMB director here at the White House, but also the president himself, suggesting there may be fraud.  through this construction project, because Jerome Powell has specifically said on two occasions that if the president were to try to fire him or ask him to step aside, he would be specific and respond no here. And so this is where this gets at the legal heart of this, of whether the president, even if he wants to before his term ends in May of 2026, Jerome Powell's term ends next year, whether he even has the ability to go through with such a move as this.  Caleb, we did see briefly markets react negatively when these reports were surfacing, which was pretty close to them when we heard from the president saying, I'm not planning to do this imminently. What could happen if he follows through with it? How do you see markets reacting?

Now we head to Capitol Hill, where the Senate worked overnight to approve $9.4 billion in spending cuts requested by President Trump. The final vote was 51 to 48, with two Republicans opposing the measure. That was Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.  This vote brings President Trump one step closer to having his Department of Government Efficiency cuts approved by Congress. NBC News correspondent, Capitol Hill correspondent, I should say, Julie Sorkin joins us from Washington with more on this. Hey, Julie, good morning. So what more can you tell us about this overnight vote, the cuts that are in this bill, and what I just mentioned there, sort of like the approval from Doge since we already saw so much of that happen?  Yeah, I think Savannah senators are unfortunately getting used to pulling all-nighters and voting overnight because we've seen this trend over the last couple of months as they try to pass the president's key agenda items. And this was certainly high on the list for the president. This is a rare move for Congress to make because essentially what they're doing in passing  This $9 billion rescissions package is giving back the funding they already appropriated. This is why you saw two Senate Republicans ultimately vote against this package, which would cut funding to foreign aid and also public broadcasting here back home. Senator Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski had concerns about those cuts, but also concerns about what  president this would set in ceding power to the executive branch, even more power. The last time this happened was back in the 1990s when a president had signed a rescissions package. So a really rare move here happening overnight. Julie, what happens next with this bill?  Well, it's going to head to the House. They could take it up as soon as today. Remember, the deadline to take this package up is actually Friday because of the procedural sort of machinations of how this process works, given that it is so rare. You mentioned Doge. Of course, that is a reason why they're trying to codify these spending cuts. $9 billion is really a drop in the bucket. And think about how difficult it is for them to put up the votes because, of course, Democrats are not voting for this, not helping Republicans out.  get these packages passed. They wanted to target a lot more in cuts. You'll remember on the campaign trail, Elon Musk, back then when he was friendly with the president, was saying that they would cut close to $2 trillion. Obviously, that's not happening. They passed a multitrillion-dollar package, Savannah, that adds money to the deficit. This is Republicans' attempts to begin to cut some of that spending. But again, just $9 billion, and still kind of a long road ahead.  Julie, also let's talk about what else you might see today in other news. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on a series of nominations later this morning. There's obviously always stuff to talk about here, but there is this one that's sort of controversial, so back and forth here. Tell us what you're watching.  Yeah, Mel Bovee, he is somebody that the president nominated to be for a lifetime appointment on the Third Circuit of Appeals. And he is controversial, Savannah, because of comments he's made in the past. He's the principal deputy attorney general for the Trump administration already. He was a lawyer for him. And he had suggested, according to whistleblowers that Democrats had tried to bring forward to stop this process. According to that whistleblower, he suggested that perhaps the Trump administration should  defy court orders, specifically when it comes to the court rulings where they tried to counter the administration's efforts in deporting migrants to foreign countries where they have no relations to in some cases. Of course, we saw that play out so publicly with Kilmar-Abrego-Garcia Democrats trying to stop this from going through. But it does sound like it will be successful. The Judiciary Committee is meeting this morning to process that nomination.  to the full floor for a vote. Tom Tillis, who was kind of that last holdout that we were watching, said yesterday he would vote for him. So it does seem like he is on a glide path to confirmation here, Savannah. All right, Julie Cirkin, thank you so much. Well, now to a devastating story out of Arizona that's gaining national attention this morning. The husband of a well-known TikTok influencer could face felony child abuse charges after their three-year-old son drowned in the family's pool. NBC News correspondent Camila Brunel has the latest on the investigation.  I love you. I love you. It's a tragedy followed by millions that could soon be a criminal case. Social media influencer Emily Kaiser's son drowned in the family pool back in May. And this is Trig. Trig was just three years old. Emily often posting about him.  I'm so grateful for Trey again. Like I love him so much. Police in Chandler, AZ say they're recommending a felony child abuse charge against the boy's father, Brady Kaiser. At the time of the drowning, Emily wasn't home, according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by our Phoenix affiliate KPNX.  Brady told police that after dinner he saw Trig in the backyard playing near the pool. He said he was distracted by his infant son and added that he lost sight of Trig for approximately three to five minutes. The documents say the dad immediately jumped in trying to save him and called 911.  Trigg died at the hospital a few days later. It rises to the level of criminal charges under the law when it's a negligent act, meaning that the parents are careless and they should have done something to prevent the death of their child.  Brady Kaiser could not be reached for comment, and Emily's attorney did not respond to our request for comment. But in a lawsuit attempting to seal the records related to Triggs death, her attorney called it a heartbreaking accidental drowning, adding Emily is going through a parent's worst nightmare.  Our thanks to Camilla Bernal for that report. Well, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office says the case is under review, but told NBC there's no timeline for a charging decision. We have much more to come here on Morning News Now this morning. Later this hour, a shocking discovery in Southern California. 21 children, many born by surrogates, found by police during a child abuse investigation. The charges the parents now face. But up first after the break, escalation in the Middle East. Israel launching a new wave of airstrikes on Syria. We'll be right back.  Welcome back. Israel has launched a wave of airstrikes against Syria. Now, this is in an effort to protect the Druze. That's an ethnic and religious minority that Israel views as an ally. Druze and Syrian sectarian forces have been involved in deadly clashes for days in the southern part of Syria.  The Syrian president said today protecting the Druze from sectarian violence is a, quote, priority. On Tuesday, the Israeli military hit the Syrian defense ministry in the heart of Damascus, as well as what it called a military target that was near the presidential palace. Well, the attack on Damascus marks a significant escalation by Israel against Syria's Islamist-led government, and the first real test of the relative stability  in that country.  Yeah, and it was a great history lesson. I mean, you summed it up. But what we're hearing about this morning is that this seems to be holding, and that is a very tenuous thing, a very fragile ceasefire that has been imposed on southwestern Syria and the area around Suwayda. You mentioned that the regime had agreed to this.  that a Druze leader who has his own militarized forces had agreed to this. But there was another rival leader of that Druze leader who agreed to the cease-fire, who last night vowed to continue fighting on until Syrian forces were ejected from Southwest Syria. Now, whether or not he continues to intend to do so, it looks as though this cease-fire is holding, despite his dissent.  So, you know, that is a big question, but we have to watch this. This is not a sure thing. It looks as though this is a fragile cease-fire that could fray at any moment after hundreds of people have already been killed.  Matt, so let's talk about the U.S. involvement here. Relations between Syria and the U.S., they appeared to be warming following President Trump's visit to the Middle East. That was back in May. He met with the Syrian president in Saudi Arabia. But then Secretary of State Marco Rubio, this was just yesterday, he said, we agreed on specific steps that will bring this troubling and horrifying situation to an end.  Let's talk about that. Do we know what steps? What do we know about the U.S. trying to de-escalate this fighting and where U.S. relations stand on both sides of this?  I don't have any details from the backroom negotiations that were going on, and I don't even know if there were backroom negotiations that were going on. But I can tell you this. The U.S. is in a very unusually good position to negotiate between the Syrian regime and the Israelis, not just because the Israelis are longtime American allies, but because the Trump administration has made an extra effort to try to rehabilitate Ahmad al-Shara, who's the president of Syria after he unseated the former dictator late last year.  Bashar al-Assad. So that means that they are in a good position to try to end this fighting. That might be what happened. But there were also Druze leaders who didn't want to see Israeli intervention, who wanted to negotiate with the regime, who wanted to end the fighting. And their voices may have prevailed before the U.S. even intervened. But it's important to note here.  Bringing in Ahmed Ashera, the Syrian president, from the cold. He's a former jihadist. He was part of Al-Qaeda. He had ties to Islamic State. Bringing him in from the cold is a priority of the Trump administration. And Israeli attacks against Syrian forces, that jeopardized that whole project. Let's talk more about Israel. The Israeli defense minister is going to be in Washington today. The plan is to meet with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other U.S. officials. What's on the agenda?  Yeah, I mean, this is going to cover a lot of what usually is discussed between two counterparts like this, weapons provisions, mil-to-mil cooperation, as they call it, in Washington and in Foggy Bottom. But, you know, we're also going to be hearing probably from Pete Hegzeth a little bit about Iran and the Gaza Strip. Pete Hegzeth has been speaking openly about American attacks against Iran, about American attacks against the Houthis in Yemen. We haven't heard Pete Hegzeth discuss  in any open way, the day after for the Gaza Strip. And that is a crucial question going forward. Who will be governing Gaza? What will be the U.S. role? What will be Israel's role? And, crucially, whether or not Hamas will have anything to do with the future of the Gaza Strip, or whether it will go to the moribund Palestinian Authority that now governs the West Bank. So, we're going to have to wait for a readout from this conversation. The fact is, is that Israel cats  had spoken in the past with major leaders from the administration. Pete Hegseth was not always there. He's been beset by scandals for the past several months. He wasn't always the guy the administration was putting forward.  All right, Matt Bradley, thank you very much. Well, in Canada, police in Vancouver are investigating what they call a hijacking after a suspect allegedly stole a small private plane.

What was your reaction when you learned they had 21 children? I was a little bit hysterical, to say the least.  Up next, the latest on a case out of Southern California that's raising questions about surrogacy agencies in America. This is Morning News Now. We are back now with a shocking case unfolding in Southern California. Police removed 21 children, many born by surrogates, from this home and placed them into protective custody in what began as a child abuse investigation. The parents have been arrested for child endangerment and neglect. NBC News correspondent Emily Ikeda has the story.  New details in an alarming child abuse investigation that led officers to discover 21 young children who lived inside this Southern California home. Many of 65-year-old Guojun Xuan and 38-year-old Sylvia Zhang's children had been born via surrogates, according to Arcadia Police. This was my first experience being a surrogate. Kayla Ann Elliott thought she was helping a couple have a second child. What was your reaction when you learned they had 21 children?  I was a little bit hysterical, to say the least. You just don't expect that you're going to hand the baby over to their parents and then all of a sudden find out that there was abuse and neglect going on. It all unraveled in May after a hospital contacted Arcadia Police to investigate the case of a two-month-old who arrived with head injuries, prompting detectives to pull surveillance video, cell phones, and hard drives from the home."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 39, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2005.962, "text": " We believe that the other children were also subject to physical and emotional abuse.

They have since been released and have not responded to our requests for comment. As investigators zero in on the agency tied to their address, Mark Surrogacy, with the help of the FBI, according to Arcadia Police.  Kelly Fell is with the Center for Bioethics and Culture Network. It's not illegal to have 20 children. It's not illegal to hire surrogate mothers. But certainly, this should open up our eyes to the fact that we are allowing an industry to just do what it pleases. Police say all of the children have been placed in protective custody. And while public records show the business license for Mark's surrogacy was recently terminated, a pregnant surrogate tells me the agency continues to contact her. Back to you.  All right, Emily, thank you so much. Well, for more on this, let's bring in our friend NBC News Legal Analyst Angela Senadella. Angela, good morning. I think this is just such a head-scratcher, so concerning to so many people, but we did just hear there, not illegal to have 20-plus kids, not illegal for surrogacy, but there is this patchwork of laws about surrogacy, state-by-state kind of. So is there anything in place that could prevent something like this from happening?  You're exactly right, in that there's nothing, like, patently illegal about someone having 21 children via surrogacy. I mean, obviously, in this country, there's no limit to the number of children you could have. Also, in the state of California, surrogacy is really recognized as very legitimate, so long as the contract was legal and was entered into knowingly by both parties with independent attorneys. But I want to note here that the reason why the children were removed really doesn't have anything to do with the surrogacy  directly, it's about child abuse and neglect, and whether or not it is your own biological children or children you had via surrogacy, or for any reason, if there is neglect or abuse in the home, then investigators can remove them. Right. Okay, this is also another really concerning and strange detail. The company involved in the surrogacy here of these kids,  is apparently registered to the couple's address in Arcadia. I mean, is it legal for someone to essentially operate a surrogacy company to broker those children, those adoptions for themselves? Yeah, that's a great question. So again, it looks really weird on its face, but there's nothing  patently illegal about doing it. That said, though, the parties who enter this contract have to know what's happening, right? That's also why all parties have to be represented by independent attorneys. That's part of surrogacy law in California. So if there was any fraud involved, and again, we don't really know because we haven't seen any of the contracts, then it's possible that there was something illegal about it. But you don't really have to disclose immediately that you own the agency. There's no law that requires that.  So you say if there's any fraud involved, like let's just take the woman who was in Emily's story there, who we just heard from, who was a surrogate mother who handed off a child to these parents. The fact that they sort of represented themselves as a couple trying for their second child, is that fraud? And could that mean that there is something there?  that could help that woman get that child back, as she said she's interested in. Right. So the determination of fraud would really come down to what was in the contract. But generally in these contracts, the most upfront issue is who has custody, right? So I'm going to guess that in these contracts, it's pretty clear that whoever carried this child does not have custodial rights to that child, that they relinquish them immediately.  So even if there is fraud in a case like this, it's not likely that then the custody would go back to the mother who carried it or the woman who carried it. It would go to the state in a case like this, and the state would then determine who could be the next legal guardian. Right, and in fact we know, for example, that that child is in foster care now rather than back with this surrogate mother.  Is there anything that you would recommend from a legal standpoint for surrogate mothers to protect themselves? Yes, so as the law requires, make sure you get an attorney who really knows what they're doing. You could also put into the contract, for example, that a background check is required for the parents who are going to be having the children. You could even ask  for full disclosures in the contract of who are the parents and what their housing and living situation is like. So all of these things, like contract law, can be negotiated up front with a good attorney. You just have to make sure it's in the contract. All right, Angela, so many questions on this one. As we get more information, we'll probably be talking to you again. Thank you so much. Well, coming up, sweet disposition. Coca-Cola now dodging a claim by President Trump. But the company is switching back to cane sugar. We'll have the latest.  Plus, a digital dilemma for public libraries, why a growing demand for e-books could become the prologue for a new legal chapter for publishers and authors. We'll get you ready next on Morning News Now.  Welcome back. In the last few years, the world of thoroughbred racing has tried to tackle the persistent problem of life-ending injuries to horses as a way to ensure the future of the sport. But this year's spring meet at the iconic Churchill Downs track in Kentucky saw an increase in the number of fatal injuries. The track reported, get this, seven horse fatalities. That was just during May and June. And that is more than the total number from all of last year.  Well, as you can imagine, these deaths leave an impression, of course, also on fans who turn out for a fun day at the track. Reporter David Mattingly from our NBC affiliate in Louisville has a look at the problem that haunts the sport. It was a Friday in June when 28-year-old equestrian Kayla Centauri and her family checked one off the bucket list with a visit to Churchill Downs. But a fun day at the track instantly changed when a horse stumbled.  It was very obvious. It was a very catastrophic break in one of his front legs where it was just swinging. And suddenly, cheers from Sensori's family turned to tears. And I was too. I was sitting there crying because I, again, I love these animals so much. I have my own horse. It's traumatic seeing it happen in person.  That trauma was repeated seven times for horses racing in Churchill Downs Spring Meet. Reviews and investigations have been launched into why the numbers went up over last year. Equine Medical Director William Farmer says the problem is not with the horses that reside and train at Churchill Downs. He attributes the increase to horses that travel from track to track.  And so when they come here to Churchill Downs and that injury occurs, it may not necessarily be a fault or a reason of Churchill Downs racetrack, but just the timing of that and that horse's cycle.  Failure to prevent common fatal injuries adds fuel to arguments from horse racing critics, who point to the ongoing fatalities as evidence that horse deaths are unavoidable. The fact that it was up in 23, down in 24, and now it looks like it's going back up, that really doesn't mean anything. There's a certain level of killing built into the industry.  Despite the spring increase in fatal injuries, Heisa, the horse racing integrity and safety authority, is expecting a return to the trend started with last year's low numbers. Overall, we're seeing still the positive trend of keeping the numbers much lower than they were pre-Heisa. But I do think we're going to see a slight uptick in the second quarter that I hope and expect we'll make up for in the third quarter.  But even if the sport recovers its safety momentum, it has lost a piece of its future. Kayla Centauri came to Churchill Downs as a fan. She left sad and conflicted."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 41, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 2487.205, "text": "But just seeing it in person and being there.

Let's turn now to some money headlines for you. We're kicking things off with a Coke. We've got the latest on speculation from the White House about a possible sweet switch up at the soda giant. CNBC's Silvana Henao has that and some other Monday news. Hey, Silvana.  Hey Savannah, good morning to you. Well, President Trump says Coca-Cola has agreed to use real cane sugar and that's following criticism of sweeteners such as high fructose corn syrup by Health Secretary RFK Jr. Now, a Coke spokesperson says the company  appreciates the president's enthusiasm for the brand. He is a noted diet Coke drinker, and she says more details on innovative offerings will be shared soon. U.S. Coke bottlers switched to corn syrup in the 1980s, and that was, of course, a cost-cutting move, but the company has long indulged fans of cane sugar by importing glass bottles of Mexican Coke. Returning to sugar in U.S. production? Well, that could affect the nation's corn farmers.  You know, Coinbase is moving further into the consumer market with an everything app that goes beyond trading. So this base app replaces the Coinbase wallet and will combine wallet trading and payments, as well as social media messaging and support for many apps. And the aim is to expand Coinbase's reach to a new category of consumers who aren't necessarily interested in buying or trading crypto, but could still benefit from that so-called on-chain ecosystem.  And TikTok will now let songwriters highlight tracks they've written or co-written directly on their profiles. So the list will live in the music tab on their profiles and it's similar to what TikTok offers to artists. Now they'll also get a songwriter label right below their account name.  And music is such a huge part of TikTok, with the platform boosting the popularity of songs and driving some TikTokers to stardom, Savannah. Oh, yeah, and giving people record contracts and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, it's huge. It's crazy. All right, Savannah, thank you so much. You got it.  OK, so I feel like you're either a physical book person or an e-book, Kindle type of person. I'm a physical book person, but it turns out a lot of people are checking out digital copies of books from their public libraries. Get this, last year alone, more than 730 million e-books were checked out across apps and libraries.  But listen to this, some librarians say it's getting hard for their budgets to keep up with the digital demand. So many libraries have these agreements to buy print books for less than the market price, but it actually costs much more to license e-books, and they can come with a lot of restrictions. Publishers and authors argue those high prices and those restrictions are necessary for their bottom line. The debate is now turning, though, into a legal battle in some states like Connecticut.  Eric Offgang is the author of this New York Times article, Libraries Pay More for E-Books. Some states want to change that. And he joins me now. Eric, good morning. So this is an interesting one, just because I think maybe it's sort of surprising that a digital e-book would cost more in some way. Or maybe people don't even know that you can check them out. So let's talk about that digital ecosystem at public libraries. What is different about the process of lending out an e-book versus a print book? Like, I think it makes sense to a lot of people. The print book, obviously, like, here you go. This is your copy until you return it.  versus an e-book that almost seems like unlimited in some way. So what does this look like? Yeah, it is surprising in a lot of ways because I think inherently we think it would be easier and less expensive to borrow an e-book, either an audio book or a digital version of a book. And it's actually much more expensive for libraries. And that's because they have to treat them like they would a physical book. So they can generally only lend out one at a time.  And the publishers charge libraries more than they would you or I, a regular consumer. They charge them sometimes as much as 10 times what they would a traditional print book. And the reason is because they say the process is very different. If you want to borrow a book from a library, the physical book, you have to make time to go down there and check that book out. Whereas those of us who use e-books, it might be late at night, you're having trouble falling asleep.  Check out a book. You can do it very quickly. OK, so now let's talk about this legal aspect. Connecticut, it's the first state to pass a law that's going to require publishers to negotiate with libraries over e-books. What's in this law exactly? And explain the precedent for any type of negotiation like there is with print books.  Yeah, so basically the idea is right now a lot of books, for instance, I wrote about in the story Fahrenheit 451. It costs libraries $52 to buy that book, that e-book, versus something like $10 for a print book. And it expires after two years. So after two years, whether someone takes it out or not, they have to buy the book again. And this is really expensive for libraries. In some books, they have to buy the book.  the e-book after it's been taken out six or seven times. The contracts vary by book, but they tend to be pretty expensive for libraries. Now the law in Connecticut, librarians have basically said that it's going to make it illegal for libraries to purchase books that are  that have a contract that is either term limited, so it expires after a certain amount of time, and expires after a certain amount of checkouts. And there's some other things that'll make it illegal for libraries to buy. Basically, the idea is that it'll make it so that libraries won't be able to agree to these e-book prices and will have to bring the publishers to the bargaining table. That is the hope. What does this mean for authors?  Yeah, so authors, it's a strange issue because authors and librarians usually, you know, are in lockstep. But on this issue, they're often separate. You know, the Authors Guild is very opposed to these. They say that e-books are different inherently than print books because they're so much easier to borrow and that it really can cut into the sales for authors if people are just going to go on and borrow e-books. Librarians don't agree with that claim, but that is a debate.  All right, Eric Afgang, interesting stuff.

Right now on Morning News Now, Mother Nature's wrath wreaking havoc on millions of Americans across the country this morning, from tornadoes in the Midwest to extreme heat here in the Northeast. Our Angie Lastman is covering it all as you start your Thursday.  Also this morning, the widening Republican rift over President Trump's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The MAGA mainstay is now breaking with the commander-in-chief as he attacks some supporters and tells them to move on. Plus, we might still be in the middle of summer, but back-to-school shopping is already kicking into high gear. So where can parents lock in those lower prices on classroom essentials before it's too late? We are watching your wallet.  And later in the hour, the so-called Gen Z stare is the viral TikTok trend that's serving up some generational beef between millennials and Gen Z. We will explain what all that means. We're going to begin this hour, though, with the extreme weather that's impacting just about every corner of the country.  Cleanup is underway in the Midwest after multiple massive tornadoes tore across southern Wisconsin yesterday. And then here in the Northeast, we are bracing for another scorcher, but that is just days after those torrential downpours. The Southeast is also dealing with unrelenting heat. And all this comes as people in cities like New Orleans are packing their sandbags and cleaning out the storm drains.  as a tropical disturbance threatens to trigger flash flooding along the Gulf Coast. NBC News correspondent George Delis, he is there in New Orleans, he's tracking it all for us. A lot going on, George, good morning.  Yes, Savannah, good morning. Residents here in New Orleans and surrounding regions on high alert as this storm system moves in, bringing in some of that tropical moisture, meaning intense rainfall and the potential for flooding. We're talking about 10 inches, some flood watches in effect. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, some tragedy to report as one person was killed and at least a dozen others were injured by a lightning strike.

So residents that we spoke with say they take every storm system, including this one, very seriously. Savannah? George, thank you so much.  Meanwhile, it's hot and humid across the southeast today, so let's get a check on your morning news now weather. Angie Lassman's here in studio with your forecast. Hey, Angie. Hi, Savannah. Good morning to you. We, of course, have summer in full swing across much of the east, and we've got a whole lot of heat alerts out there right now. The northeast included in that, as well as parts of the south stretching up into the Tennessee Valley. 71 million people right now under heat alerts. It does include New York, Washington, D.C., Norfolk, and these locations extending up into Boston are going to see, once again, temperatures well above 90 and feeling like  the triple digits in some spots. You can see where we land today in Washington, D.C., 97 degrees, low 90s for Boston, mid 90s for Jackson and Nashville. You look just back to the West, though, and this cold front that is sparking up some showers and thunderstorms and potential flooding is bringing us a little relief behind it. That's all settled in for parts of the Midwest. Notice the mid 70s in Minneapolis. We're running cooler than normal in Chicago, with just a high of 73 degrees today.  If you're looking for some of that milder air in parts of the northeast, you're going to get it, especially the interior areas tomorrow. Notice Binghamton down to the low 70s. Detroit, you'll be in the 70s. Minneapolis will keep that streak going. But the southeast, not so much. We keep those 90s on tap from Fort Worth all the way to Wilmington. And again, the humidity levels will be up, so it'll be feeling warmer than that as well.  Heading into the weekend and into early next week, it's pretty typical for mid-July. We're going to see kind of some mixed highs out there, but up into New England, temperatures in the 80s. We've got a couple of high 80s to low 90s out there for the mid-Atlantic. And then we keep the 90s going for Memphis as well. On top of that, of course, we are tracking this tropical disturbance that we've been watching over the past couple of days. It reemerged into parts of the Gulf of Mexico, or Gulf of America, rather.  and we are looking at some heavy rain across parts of the central gulf coast here for the next couple of days. This is going to be something that you see not just today but into tomorrow and potentially saturday where we pick up ample amounts of rain. As you look at those uh the timeline of this through thursday and even into friday you can see some of the heaviest the rain kind of displaced off to the west side of the center of that system  And that means that anywhere from Louisiana stretching out to parts of the Florida panhandle could see some of the heaviest of the rain, really intense hourly rainfall rates. So we, of course, are concerned about the potential for flash flooding. When we look all the way through Saturday, some double digit rainfall amounts are expected. So we've got 10 to 15 inches in localized amounts. I think close to the coast is where you'll see those higher amounts. And again, just to the west of that center is where we're seeing really the impressive rainfall.  So watching for the flood concerns across that region as we get through at least Saturday. Notice the big picture look for looking ahead to the weekend. Less humid conditions as expected across the Northeast. We'll see a whole lot of sunshine for the West. We've really got a great kind of Friday on tap for folks there. There's the rain that's still in the picture from the Gulf Coast stretching up into the Tennessee and Ohio Valley and a little bit of that rain across parts of the upper Midwest as well. We head into Saturday. Some of that rain centered from the Great Lakes and out into parts of the east here as we get into Sunday.  All right, Angie, thank you so much. Well, as millions of Americans continue to deal with devastating flood damage or the threat of one that could happen, we're taking a closer look at what you can do to help protect your home and your family as these extreme weather events become more common. NBC News Chief Consumer Investigative Correspondent Vicky Nguyen is here with steps that you could take right now so you are ready before the next storm. I think so many people have this on their mind. Vicky, I'm so happy you did this. Good morning.  Yeah, it's a really top of mind issue, important to discuss, important to be ready. Good morning to you. Most of us do not have flood insurance, but as we're seeing with these latest storms, severe weather can strike quickly and it can leave behind tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to your home. So this morning, we have expert advice to help you prepare and also tell you what to do in the aftermath of a storm.  It can happen in seconds. Just one inch of flood water can cause immense and costly damage. The floods came fast. It was dramatic from no real warning to a huge influx of water. Massive storms turned Lisa Spurn's New Jersey neighborhood into a marshy mess, even crippling her recently installed drain system. When the water started coming in, it seeped into the hallway, then it seeped into our playroom, and then before I knew it, it was in the basement.  Do you have any idea at this point how much it's going to cost you to fix all the damage? It'll be, at best estimate, tens of thousands of dollars.

All right, Vicky, so many people, again, like we just mentioned, probably thinking about this and wondering, should I go ahead and splurge on flood insurance? What do you think? Yeah, I think it's super important for people to know that it can be expensive, but it can be worthwhile. As you saw with Lisa there, she's not even in an area that's considered a flood zone, and yet she's had three floods in the past 20 years. So a couple of options. You can either go with your private insurance, start with your homeowner's insurance, and ask them, how much would a flood policy cost to add on each year?  Also, FEMA has a program, the National Flood Insurance Program, that is supposed to ensure affordable access to a policy. The thing is, you do want to compare, you want to shop around, and make sure you ask a lot of questions about what exactly is covered. So true, because in your home insurance, by the way, flood is not normally. No, it is not normally covered. Neither is earthquake. Those are separate policies. Wow. All right, Vicky, thank you so much. You bet.  Well, now to Washington, where President Trump is slamming some of his own supporters who are calling for this release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Certainly a talker. Gabe, good morning.  Hey, there, Savannah. Good morning. It is a rare rebuke from the president taking on some of his own allies. Now, Epstein died by suicide in prison in 2019.

And while sightings are up, shark attacks are rare. The United States had 28 unprovoked shark attacks last year. Half of them reported in Florida. More people are being more alert. We're having increased sightings because there are more eyes on the water. Marianne Walsh with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy says while Cape Cod sightings are up, the actual number of sharks is consistent.  All this extra shark talk that's going on right now, warranted or not? This is a special year. It's the 50th anniversary of JAWS.

Look to the lifeguard stand, see what kind of flags they might have overhead. There are a couple different ones that might give an indication about potential shark activity. A yellow flag can mean that there are bait fish in the area. Remember, those attract sharks. Then there's the purple flag that can refer to hazardous marine life. That could be jellyfish or stingrays or sharks.  And then there's the double red flag. If you see two red flags stacked together, that means no swimming allowed. The waters are closed and sharks could be the reason there. But all of these are maybes at each beach. So when you get to a beach for the first time, you should find out what the lifeguards would use to signal you in case of any kind of emergencies, because these signals are not necessarily universal. They can mean different things in each community. Just another reminder, as an expert said to us,  Beaches are wild environments. You are stepping into a wild environment when you go there. But obviously, we still want everyone to be able to have fun this summer. Back to you. Absolutely. Really good advice and tips there. Get the information. Know what the warning signs are. Jesse, thank you so much. Well, we are learning more details this morning about a big change that could be coming to airport security checkpoints.  After we just heard one last week right about shoes, well now this one involves liquids and gels. It was just last week when the TSA announced it would no longer require passengers to take those shoes off while going through security. NBC News Senior Correspondent Tom Costello has the details.  Yeah, good day. When Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took office, she said she immediately began looking at the TSA requirements, regulations, procedures, passenger screening, asking whether they were still appropriate. And now, after having removed the requirement for passengers to take off their shoes for screenings, now she says she's considering the same with liquids and gels. Here's the secretary."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 78, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 4118.122, "text": " liquids I'm questioning so that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 79, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 4123.852, "text": "We have put in place in TSA a multi-layered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it still is safe.  So any change to TSA procedures could be months away, potentially even years away. TSA and Homeland Security say that they are partnering with companies to test the technology that would screen potentially for liquids and gels. A reminder, the 3-1-1 rule remains in effect at checkpoints.  You cannot carry more than 3.4 ounces in a single plastic bag when you go through the checkpoint. Anything more than that must be thrown out or must be checked. Now, I got to tell you, a lot, in fact, most security pros I talk to, including former top homeland security experts, are very worried that the TSA is pulling back security requirements.  They make the point that, first of all, we have major events next year. We have the World Cup. We have the America 250 celebrations. In addition, this year alone, we have already had U.S. action in the Middle East, in Iran, in Yemen, supplying weapons to the Israeli military and Gaza.  The FBI has already warned of potential terror cells, sleeper cells, in the United States. The liquid explosives rule came about after somebody tried to blow up a plane with liquid explosives. And the shoe requirement came into place after a shoe bomb attempt. There is currently no technology at airport security checkpoints.  to screen for explosive liquids or shoe bombs. So the concern is that the United States is pulling back on the very security requirements, the checkpoints that have kept this country safe for so long. Bottom line is this is still a work in progress, no imminent decision, we're told, from Homeland Security, at least not yet. Back to you.  All right, Tom, thank you so much. There's much more to come on this hour of Morning News now, including some exclusive NBC News reporting that's now revealing the limited impact of America's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites last month. First, though, after the break, this is an alarming security breach here. It was at the National Guard. Defense officials are blaming Beijing for a hacking campaign that lasted nearly a year. That is next.  Welcome back. Officials are on edge this morning after the U.S. Defense Department discovered an alarming security breach at one branch of the military. The department found that an elite Chinese cyber group got a nickname. It's called Salt Typhoon. It hacked into at least one state's National Guard network for nearly a year.  And it believes the hackers may have obtained sensitive military or law enforcement information. NBC News Digital Reporter Kevin Collier joins us now to explain what happened here. He covers cybersecurity, privacy, technology policy for us. Kevin, good morning. So, this was revealed in this Department of Homeland Security memo back in June, but there's still a lot we don't know. Like, for example, which state's National Guard was actually hacked. What does this mean for National Guard networks and, more broadly, just American cybersecurity?  I mean, at minimum, these hackers were able to access physical maps, service members, personal information, descriptions of how the computer networks are set up. And crucially, these are top-tier Chinese intelligence hackers, and the National Guard is set up at this intersection of the U.S. military, individual states, law enforcement. The memo we found, found that at least as of last month, officials were still working to determine how the hackers might have pivoted to other states' Guard networks, state government networks, law enforcement networks. The Guard told me they're still assessing the impact here.  How are Washington and Beijing responding to these details in this memo? Beijing kind of gave us a non-denial denial, as they generally do with cyber operations. Washington is generally on its back foot with this stuff. You have to remember that the Trump administration has fired a whole host of cyber personnel in its first few months. And this campaign was able to sit presumably undetected for nine months from March to December last year.  Kevin, this isn't the first time I understand that this particular group had hacked major U.S. infrastructure. Tell us about that happening before and the fact that it has been able to happen multiple times. What does that mean we need to do to make ourselves more secure? Yeah, I mean, most notably, this is the same group that was behind what was probably the largest cyber espionage operation against the United States infrastructure in history. This last year, they hacked most major U.S. telecom companies,  AT&T Verizon. They access the calls text messages and voicemails of top U.S. officials. It was the Trump campaign. J.D. Vance the Harris campaign then Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office. They did all of that. Those are the ones we know about. Parting U.S. cybersecurity is extraordinarily complicated problem. It does not look like we are positioned to make serious strides in the immediate future.  All right, Kevin, fascinating reporting. Thank you so much. We now have some exclusive reporting from NBC News to bring you this morning. A new U.S. assessment has found that last month's American strikes on Iran only destroyed one of three nuclear sites. And then the other two, they were not as badly damaged, and they may have been downgraded to just a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months.  That's according to five current and former U.S. officials familiar with this assessment. Well, additionally, a current U.S. official and two former U.S. officials told NBC News that U.S. Central Command had developed a much more comprehensive plan to strike Iran, but that President Trump rejected it. It would have lasted weeks and involved hitting three additional sites. Responding to our reporting, a spokesperson at the Pentagon said Iran's nuclear facilities  at the three sites were, quote, completely obliterated. Well, now let's turn to developing news. This is out of eastern Iraq. Officials there say dozens of people have been killed after a fire tore through a shopping mall. NBC News International correspondent Claudia LaVonda joins us with that and other world news in 60 seconds. Claudia, good morning.  According to Reuters, at least 69 people have now been killed and another 11 are missing after a massive fire engulfed a hypermarket in Iraq. Videos posted on social media show firefighters trying to contain the massive blaze in the city of Al-Qud. An investigation on the cause of the fire has been opened.  Now to the tiny African kingdom of Eswatini. The Trump administration deported five immigrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba to the southern African country after officials say they committed serious crimes in the U.S.  But now, as Watini officials say, they are planning to repatriate them, pushing back on what is reportedly considered the first, quote, third country deportation. And let's end this tour of the world in Belgium now, where on Wednesday, organizers of the Tomorrowland Music Festival said a fire severely damaged the main stage.  the major electronic dance music festival opened its doors to thousands of visitors from around the world today. Organizers say no one was injured in the fire, and they're trying to find a solution to allow major stars like David Guetta and Swedish House Mafia to play. Back to you, Savannah. All right, Claudio, thank you. Well, coming up, clearing the air. The former first couple, Barack and Michelle Obama, speaking out about rumors that their decades-long marriage is on the rocks. We've got more on that next.  Back now with a closer look at what's making news in the world of politics this morning. We're going to start with the passage of a key package in the Senate to cut billions in funding. NBC News Capitol Hill correspondent Julie Cirkin is here with more. Hey Julie.  Hey Savannah, good morning. We begin here on Capitol Hill where Senate Republicans, as you mentioned, narrowly passed a $9 billion rescissions package, a pretty rare move for the Senate since they voted to give back funding they already passed into law because the Trump administration asked them to. The cuts impact foreign aid and public broadcasting here at home. Two issues, Senator Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, both Republicans just couldn't get past.  Plus, the idea of giving the executive branch even more power didn't sit right with them. The package, Savannah, now heads to the House for a vote, where they have to pass it by tomorrow. And staying in Washington, Jerome Powell's job might be safe, at least for the moment, because President Trump yesterday said it was, quote, highly unlikely that he would fire the Federal Reserve chair.  But that doesn't mean he's happy with the job Powell is doing. Trump has long criticized the man he himself appointed to the top post of the Fed, calling on Powell repeatedly for months to cut interest rates. The president even asked a group of lawmakers earlier this week whether he should fire Powell. But even Speaker Johnson said it isn't clear what authority Trump has to do it.  And finally, and perhaps most importantly, we had a major softball game here in D.C. last night. Unfortunately, the press team, a.k.a. the Bad News Babes, coached by our very own Ryan Nobles and Frank Thorpe, lost to Team Congress. The score was 5-3, but the game did end early because of lightning and storms.  But no matter what, the real winners are the young women battling breast cancer who will hopefully benefit from the money raised by this annual tradition. Since the games began back in 2009, more than $4 million has been donated to the Young Survival Coalition. And that is a look at what is making news in politics this morning. Julie, did you play? Savannah? No. No one wants to see that. I was, like, looking for you in the footage.  No, not for me, but I supported my teammates. I guess that all matters. You know, it wouldn't be for me either, so I totally understand. There's no chance I would have done that either. All right, Julie, thank you.  Well, 80 years after the U.S. tested a nuclear bomb in a New Mexico desert, nearby communities are still dealing with the aftermath.

Coming up, playing it safe online when Morning News now returns. The new safety feature is being introduced on one of the world's biggest platforms with America's teen gamers in mind. That is next. Stick around.  Welcome back. We now have a topic we want to discuss that we talk about a lot on this show, and it's digital safety for kids online. According to the Pew Research Center, virtually all teenagers in the US now report using the internet every day. Maybe not a surprise, but take a look at this. Roughly half of them say they are online.  quote, almost constantly. So with all that time spent online, of course, safety becomes even more important with concerns that young people's mental health is suffering or that they could be targeted by bad actors. Always a concern for parents. Well, today we're going to talk to the man who runs one of the world's most visited gaming destinations. Roblox has nearly 98 million daily users. They notch up billions of hours of engagement playing millions of different games.  In November, it announced new safety features for users under 13 years old. And now today, the platform is introducing this expanded suite of features for its teenage users, those who are 13 to 18. Well, the co-founder and CEO of Roblox, Dave Bazzucchi, joins us now. Dave, good morning. Thanks so much for being here. So first, if you just could, for parents or people maybe who are not parents,  who don't really know a lot about Roblox or how it works. The fact that you can create games in addition to joining games, and there's a lot of flexibility here. Just explain a little bit, if you could quickly, about how Roblox works, what users come to your platform for.  Hey, thanks for having us on the program. Every day, almost 100 million daily active users come to our platform to play, to communicate, to hang out. And everything they're doing is happening in creations made by the community. We have hobbyist creators. We have kids getting interested in STEM. And more and more, we have large studios on the platform. It's part of what we've shared as our vision of really having over 10% of the gaming market  running on Roblox. And today's a big day in that we've been innovating on safety and civility for almost 20 years. And we're introducing the notion of age based communication. And I'm really glad to be here to share more about it with you.  Yeah, so let's talk now about these new features. Age-based communication, sort of meaning that that's always a concern, right? When I mentioned bad actors a second ago, that's a lot of times how bad things happen, right? As people who are maybe much older than your child or who are not who they say they are are able to communicate with children. What will these new features mean? Explain trusted connections, what that looks like, and also how parents are able to get information about who their kids are communicating with and what they're saying.  Yeah, our vision really is to go way beyond government or legislation and also go beyond an area that most social platforms aren't delving into, and that's this vulnerable teenage of 13 through 17. We're introducing four pieces of functionality that work together. The first is trusted connections, so allowing teens to connect with people they really know and trust, typically in the real world, and making that possible through age estimations.  So the combination of these two things together we're allowing them to speak a little more freely when you have a trusted connection and we estimate your age to make sure you're ready to do that. What's really important about this is we're constantly trying to keep people on the Roblox platform not as much for growth or because we want more engagement.  Because our platform is very safe and we don't allow image sharing. We don't allow a lot of the other things that happen on other platforms like unfiltered communication or communication that's not monitored for critical harms. In addition, we're introducing a bunch of new ways that teams, for example, can  can watch their notifications, things that just basically help them monitor their account or who they're hanging out with, or even screen time for teens. And finally, we're allowing teens who connect with their parents to bring their parents into the fold and have their parents also watch spending or who their connections are.  I want to ask you about that age confirmation, because this is some new technology that you're rolling out, kind of a new added step, because that's where so much of the criticism comes, whether it be gaming, whether it be social media, is that if kids are able to just say, hey, I'm not actually 13, then they're totally, like, exempt from any of these protections. But you guys are trying to confirm that if somebody is, in fact, under the age of 18, that they're put into these. How are you doing that?  We believe the future of unfiltered communication between teens in private is going to be based on age estimation and trusted connections. So AI has been a driving force of our company in safety and civility for over four years. We have over 200 AI models running.  for our voice systems and all of that. We're using AI along with a very quick cell feed to estimate age. And we're only going to allow trusted connections and free communication for those who we estimate to be over 13. We're not waiting for, for example, device manufacturers to give an age. It's something we've decided we have to do. And we think this will be the new standard for safety and civility for teens.  Can you tell me maybe what you would say to a parent who's concerned about the content that they see? I mean, I have done some reporting in my past, like I said, because you can create games about that sort of being abused, and almost even at the time I was reporting on, like, strip club-like environments within a video game that I know some parents were super surprised to see was even a possibility with their kids being able to see. How would you reassure parents that the content that their kids are seeing is age-appropriate?  Yeah, so in addition to all of the things we're introducing today about communication safety, content safety is also first and foremost on our platform. We've innovated with experience guidelines, with a very concise policy for all ages.  We have zero tolerance on Roblox for any content that is not age appropriate. We've introduced the notion of 17 and up content for certain types of content. And once again, we, with the introduction of AI over the last four years, just continuously get better and better and better and faster and faster at just making sure 100% of the content on our platform is age appropriate. We have no tolerance for people who try to get around our guidelines.  Dave Bazzucchi, thank you very much for joining us this morning to talk about these brand new features. We appreciate your time. Thank you very much.  Let's stay on some business headlines. Walmart is reportedly shaking up its aisles, so to speak, with some new structural changes. CNBC's Silvana Henao has that and other money news. Hey, Silvana. Hey, Silvana. Good morning to you. Yes, so Walmart is restructuring some support and training rules in its stores. That's according to a memo seen by Reuters and Bloomberg First reported hundreds of store jobs would be affected. Now, Walmart is eliminating the position of  market coordinator and is adjusting some roles in its training academies to train more associates in person. The memo says Walmart plans to offer affected employees other roles as coaches. Large theater chains including Regal and Cinemark have held talks about jointly marketing their big screen theaters to compete with IMAX.  Bloomberg reports the talks have focused on setting standards for premium large format theaters with options including a new brand name. Now the chains are motivated by a desire to reduce their growing influence of IMAX which commands about 10 percent of box office revenue for blockbusters.  And sales of Tesla Cybertruck have dropped sharply from their peak last year, so much so that the larger and more expensive GMC Hummer EZ outsold the steel Cybertruck last quarter. The new data from Cox Automotive shows Tesla sold just over 4300 Cybertrucks versus the 4500 Hummers GMC sold. Now both were beat by the Ford F-150 Lightning, which has reclaimed the crown as the best selling electric truck,  Even the Lightning is struggling as Ford recorded its lowest sales total for the vehicle in more than a year, Savannah. All right, wow. All right, Savannah, thank you. It might only be mid-July, but one sign that the end of summer is sort of near. Back to school shopping. It is in full swing.

Are people's concerns about prices going up valid? Do we think that's going to happen? So we've already seen some prices increase, like backpacks are already a little bit higher. You look at pens and pencils, those prices are higher. Tablets and paper, that's not higher. But these are things that we've been really watching. It's a back-to-school price creep overall.  And we think that maybe later in the fall, you'll start to see prices rising even more. You've got companies with bigger import costs. And so at some point, they're going to be passing that on. But they're not right now. You've seen so many back-to-school sales already, right? The reason why they're not passing them on quite yet is because they preloaded all of this inventory. With all this uncertainty in the world, they preloaded all this inventory. So you're still seeing pre-trade war kind of prices, I think, in some of these sales.  And I said that some of these deals are available right now. What are stores trying to offer people? OK, so you've got Walmart saying that it's going to have lower than last year prices on its 14 best-selling items. They're going to have $1, $5, and $10 deals. Target has $5 backpacks. And it says its 20 most popular items will be under $20 together.  Look at this. They have a 20% student and teacher discount. Staples has that too. Please use it. I did that last year when I sent my first kid to college. When you buy all the stuff for a kid going to a dorm room and you get a 20% discount, that really, really helps. And Amazon has bundles and digital coupons as well. But, you know, we started getting press releases, you know, the beginning of June from these big companies saying, we are not going to raise prices. We are not going to raise prices because they just really want to make sure that they're getting you in the dorm. Because surveys show us, Savannah,  that people are willing to switch stores and switch brands if they're going to find something cheaper elsewhere. So what is your advice to parents? Maybe they're kind of more like me. They're like, well, I don't want to think about this yet. It's summer. Is the advice to buy now? What would you say? I think the advice is to buy now. Stay within your budget. Don't overbuy.  A lot of personal finance experts, including me, say, reuse the stuff that you didn't use last year, the big binders and stuff. You can reuse some of that stuff. My kids always say, but, mom, it's not new. I'm like, in two weeks, it's not going to be new anymore anyway, so please use that.

There are now more than 27 million Americans working as independent contractors, having the flexibility to make their own schedule to decide when, where, and how they want to work. More and more I'm hearing from people back home, and they want jobs that offer this type of freedom.  Just one example I'd love to share. I got picked up by Uber or Lyft at the New Orleans airport, and the guy had just moved from San Francisco to New Orleans. Two great cities, but obviously he chose the best of the two, and he just wanted to do it. And so he calls up Lyft and says, I'm moving to New Orleans. He shows up and then goes immediately to work. Because he worked independently, he had that freedom to move place to place without losing a source of income.  And then another guy, he's a daggum chemical engineer. And he says he'd rather be a Lyft driver. And he goes, I'm tired of the cubicle. He goes, I got this car. I take the car fishing on the day off. I can take my day off anytime I want to take a day off. But he stays with his chemical engineering job because he wants the benefits.  but he'd rather have the freedom and the benefits. Now, I get that. People need a 401k, they need health insurance. So, whether it's a hairstylist, musician, artist, in my state, a swamp tour guide, a rideshare driver, software designer, independent truck driver,  None of them should have to choose between a flexible work schedule and having a 401k or health coverage. So, Congress, we should modernize labor laws to catch up on the 21st century and meet the needs of today's workers. Now, our labor laws are about 100 years old, and that prevents the independent worker from receiving the benefits that they would have if they choose to be a flexible independent worker.  Now, we've heard from companies that want to give benefits to contractors, but they don't because of fear of misclassification lawsuits. So last week, I joined Republican colleagues Senators Paul and Scott in releasing a legislative package modernizing federal law, giving power back to the workers.  This pro-worker package establishes a safe harbor so that a worker can keep his or her independent status while unliking benefits for themselves and their families. It strengthens workers' flexibility. It makes it clear what legally constitutes an independent contractor.  The package also increases workers' access to health care and retirement accounts like Solo 401ks that are already available under federal law. I appreciate Senator Paul and Tim Scott for their leadership. And by the way, this is not partisan. States with Democratic governors like Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Wisconsin, red states like Georgia, Utah, and Tennessee, all working on pilot programs or legislation supporting portable benefits.  And while these concepts are being vetted in laboratories of democracies, outdated federal law still brings the threat of lawsuits preventing workers nationwide from accessing benefits. It's time we establish consistency and clarity for every worker,  so that those who wish to be independent contractors can not only have the flexibility and independence, but also the financial security. So, I urge all of us, Democrat, Republican, to work together to achieve this goal, just as Democrats and Republicans on the state level are doing the same thing. I thank the witnesses for being here. Thank you all for representing your position. And I look forward to our discussion on how we can empower workers to succeed. With that, I recognize Senator Sanders.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, panelists, for being with us. I don't have any good Uber stories. But what I do know is that in America today we have more income and wealth inequality than we have ever had in the history of the United States.  We have a situation where the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 93%. CEOs of large corporations now earn 350 times more than their average workers.  According to the Rand Corporation, not a socialist operation, over the past 50 years, $79 trillion in wealth has been redistributed from the bottom 90% to the top 1%. Today, quite unbelievably, the average American worker makes less, less in real inflation accounted for dollars than he or she did 52 years ago.  So that's where we are right now. There are a lot of reasons for that that we're not going to get into today. But one of the more important reasons why the working class in America is worse off than they were 50 years ago, despite huge increases in worker productivity, is the fact that corporate America has been waging a war against the trade union movement for decades.  According to the latest Gallup poll, 70% of the American people support labor unions, and yet only 6% of private sector workers belong to one. All over the country, people want to join unions, and yet in the private sector, mere 6% are in unions. Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, I'm afraid that the bills that we are considering today would only make a bad and unfair situation even worse.  These proposals would make it easier for large corporations to misclassify workers as independent contractors in order to avoid paying them decent wages and decent benefits. These bills are not about giving workers the freedom to work. These bills are about giving corporations the freedom to deny workers the right to form a union. They're about giving corporations the freedom to pay workers poverty wages and denying workers the overtime pay that they are owed.  In other words, they would give corporations like Amazon, Uber, and Lyft the freedom to exploit their workforce. The reality is that the safe harbor provisions included in this legislation would give large corporations a blank check to break our nation's labor laws. A few years ago, I met with truck drivers in California who were misclassified as independent contractors. Never forget that.  big lineup of trucks near the harbor. One truck driver told me he worked 100 hours a week and not only did he not get paid for that work week, he ended up owing the company a check. What was his crime? The trucking company forced him to lease the truck he was driving for an outrageously high fee and then fired him for speaking out against that injustice. And that's happening all over the country.  At yesterday's hearing, we heard concerns from Senator Hawley about how Amazon drivers are misclassified as independent contractors and denied the right to form a union even though they wear Amazon vests, drive Amazon vehicles, deliver Amazon packages, and have their work schedule controlled by Amazon. He was right.  Instead of denying workers the right to form a union, we should make it easier for workers to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits. Virtually every major union in this country supports the PRO Act, the right for workers to join a union without being illegally attacked by their employer.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record letters opposing these bills from the AFL-CIO, the SEIU, the National Nurses Union, United, the National Employment Law Project, and others. Without objection. Instead of denying workers the right to decent wages, we should be raising the minimum wage to at least $17 an hour.  Instead of denying health care to workers with pre-existing conditions, we should do what every other major country on earth does, guarantee health care to all people as a human right. If we're serious about addressing the retirement crisis, which is what we're talking about today to some degree, the way to do that is to bring back defined benefit pension plans.  Now, I know that a lot of young people in the audience may not even know what a defined benefit pension plan is. Guess what? Your grandparents, when they went to work, if they worked for a large company, when they retired, they had a pension plan. They knew exactly how much they were getting for the rest of their lives. According to the Congressional Research Service, in 1975, 44% of private sector workers in America had a defined benefit pension plan.  that guaranteed a monthly income in retirement. Today that figure has dropped to just 9%. This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. And we should not have millions of people reaching retirement age with nothing in the bank.  worrying about how they're going to make it through their last years on earth. And that has got to change. And that is why I've introduced the Pensions for All Act this morning. This legislation would provide comprehensive retirement coverage to the more than 56 million working class Americans who currently have no pension plan through their employer. If we can guarantee a defined benefit pension plan for members of Congress, not a bad plan, guys, we can and must  provide that same level of retirement security to every worker in America. That is precisely what this legislation would do, and I am proud that it has the strong support of the UAW, the Alliance for Retired Americans, and the Association of Flight Attendants. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. And so now we'll hear from our witnesses.  I'll first introduce Patrice Onuka, who is the director of the Center for Economic Opportunity at the Independent Women's Forum. Ms. Onuka is an expert on economic and employment issues and has written extensively on independent work. She's a senior adjunct fellow with the Philanthropy Roundtable.  and a Tony Blankley Fellow at the Steamboat Institute. She holds a bachelor's degree in economics and political science from Tufts and a master's degree in international relationships from Boston College. We look forward to hearing from you today. Thank you, ma'am."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 638.547, "text": " Thank you, Chairman Cassidy, Ranking Member Sanders, and the members of this committee. I appreciate being invited to speak today. My name is Patrisse Nwuka, and I'm Director of the Center for Economic Opportunity at Independent Women. We advance policies that enhance people's freedoms, opportunity, and well-being, and we have a special focus on women's opportunities.  Flexible work through independent contracting is critical to women's labor force attachment. Independent workers value the ability to work for whom they want, when, where, and how they choose. They do not want to lose that flexibility, yet some of them lack access to benefits such as health care by the nature of this 1099 work arrangement. This creates economic and health vulnerability and disincentivizes entrepreneurship. But Congress can overcome some of these challenges by avoiding mass reclassification of workers through stingent employment tests,  and instead harmonizing the independent contractor definition across federal agencies with a clear and simple test. Also, create a safe harbor so that organizations and companies can offer portable benefits to independent contractors without triggering misclassification. I'll share more on this with you today.  No worker should be forced into a traditional 9 to 5 job. Freelancing and self-employment are longstanding work arrangements in the United States. An estimated 70 million people freelance, nearly half of them women. Over 80% of independent contractors said they prefer their work arrangement over traditional employment. And flexibility is the driving force.  People are raising children, caregiving for aging parents, and managing their own health issues. Others find independent contracting as an entry into entrepreneurship. When you look at women, nine out of 10 female workers who left full-time employment did so because of flexibility, like Jeanette Lonergan, a long-haul freight driver who serves as the primary caregiver for her father-in-law while she's working a full-time job.  So independent contractors want, and in some cases need, to remain independent because of their unique circumstances. Today, employer-provided healthcare is the predominant source of health insurance for working-age adults. And for many American workers, that is fine, but it is out of the reach for independent contractors by law, even would-be entrepreneurs. 20% of them say that they've abandoned the idea of starting a business because of fear over losing health insurance.  Now, not all flexible workers are the same. According to the IRS data, the largest share of independent contractors are supplemental earners who have full-time jobs elsewhere and may also have benefits, employer-provided benefits. Yet, there's a meaningful share of independent contractors who do not because they don't have that full-time work or a spouse that has healthcare coverage and they would benefit from some kind of option. Now, mass reclassification is the wrong solution to this problem.  Expanding health care benefits by forcing independent contractors to be reclassified as employees is ill-advised and undermines workers' choices, their freedoms, and their labor attachment. The Protecting the Right to Organize Act utilizes an ABC test, while the Department of Labor's independent contractor rule, finalized in 2023, uses a multi-factor test. But both approaches effectively would reclassify millions of independent contractors against their wills.  When California did so, we saw the devastating impacts. Self-employment fell 10.6%, and overall employment fell over 4%. Entire professions were wiped out, and professionals were left with nothing to show for it. Jessica Tucker, for example, she was earning $60 an hour as a transcriber. She says, AB5 took this away from me, and my family has been struggling to put food on the table ever since.  Portable benefits, though, are the right way forward. They respect independent work status. They stay with the worker instead of with a specific employer. And workers can get access to lots of different benefits. But federal law prohibits companies and individuals from being offered this. And so a safe harbor in federal law  would make it possible for affordable benefits to be offered. And the support, public support, is strong. At Independent Women, we released polling this year that found 82% of women said the government should not force people to work nine to five jobs. And an even higher share, 87% of women and 83% of adults, say the government should make it easier for independent contractors without traditional employment to get access to affordable health and benefits.  States aren't waiting for Washington. We've seen it in Utah, Pennsylvania, and other states, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Wisconsin. So key bills that can overcome these hurdles, well, the Unlocking Benefits for Independent Workers Act, and similarly, the Modern Worker Security Act,  as well as the Worker Empowerment Act. Policymakers, you all have an opportunity to harmonize the independent contractor definition across federal law, and even more, to unlock portable benefits for independent workers without sacrificing their freedom.

Ms. Coven also co-founded the nonpartisan group Fight for Freelancers to advocate for independent workers. She writes a substack on this issue. Ms. Coven is a graduate of the University of Missouri Columbia School of Journalism, and thank you, ma'am, for testifying.  Thank you, Chairman Cassidy and Ranking Member Sanders, for the chance to speak on behalf of America's tens of millions of independent contractors today. My name is Kim Cavan. I'm from New Jersey. My parents were public school teachers, and I grew up in a proud union household. I earned a journalism degree from the University of Missouri, and I had staff jobs at newspapers and magazines until I was about 30. That's when I realized some freelancers were earning more than I was.  It's one reason I chose to go freelance 22 years ago. Now, I'm 53. Freelancing is one of my best life choices. When Gallup says two-thirds of Americans want to be their own bosses, I get it. You can count me strongly among the 80 percent of independent contractors who prefer this way of working. It was alarming to all of us in 2019 when California passed Assembly Bill 5.  The claim was that AB5 would stop employee misclassification, but it went way beyond that. The regulatory language hurt independent contractors across more than 600 professions. When New Jersey tried to copy AB5, some friends and I created a coalition called Fight for Freelancers. We packed our statehouse for a standing-room-only public hearing where we testified for more than four hours straight  Women, men, people of all races, ages, people who had voted for you, Senator Sanders, and for President Trump, all of us stood shoulder to shoulder fighting for our freedom to earn a living. We won. And ever since, we've been fighting to stop this lunacy nationwide. I respect people who choose traditional jobs and unions, but I do not see that same respect being given to independent contractors.  Instead, we're being forced to fight the PRO Act in Congress. We had to sue the U.S. Labor Department. And our friends in California are still suffering. AB5 is such a disaster that Governor Gavin Newsom's former Deputy Chief of Staff said it's truly horrific how many people are negatively impacted by it. The Trump administration's Deputy U.S. Labor Secretary called it catastrophic.  Members of the California Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights warned that it disproportionately and negatively affects women, immigrants, people of color, and the politically powerless. A California assemblyman is asking the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate.  It's just bad policy. California's pace of job creation tanked by 81%. Union membership went down. Self-employment for affected professions took a 10.5% hit. Overall employment dropped, too. And right now, the state of New Jersey is trying to create AB5 on steroids. Attorneys say a proposed rule almost entirely eviscerates any chance of being an independent contractor, while the state itself  says the rule won't create a single job. This is not targeting employee misclassification. This is weaponizing regulatory language to attack independent contractors. We just had another public hearing in Trenton and it was standing room only again for more than three hours in a heat wave.  The chief legal officer at Prudential, with headquarters in Newark for 150 years, said what's happening may be impossible for them. AAA's witness said it could jeopardize public safety by impairing roadside towing. The president of the bi-state motor carriers, who's sitting right behind me today, said this would cripple the port of New York and New Jersey. It went on and on, and there was a new talking point  This is not unions versus independent contractors. But just as we see at this table here today, every single witness for this in New Jersey was employed by unions or affiliated with organizations that have strong union ties. I listed them in my written testimony, and I can provide video.  I also detailed how some of their so-called research is highly questionable. Some of it seems purposely mischaracterized, including in a government report. You're going to hear a lot today about how employee misclassification is wrong. That's true. But it's equally wrong to reclassify independent contractors right out of business. We shouldn't need a law to protect our freedom to be our own bosses, but here we are.  Please pass the Modern Worker Empowerment Act and end this madness once and for all. Thank you. Next witness is Kev Coleman, a research fellow at Paragon Health Institute. Mr. Coleman is an expert on the topic of health insurance, which is a major focus of today's hearing, association health plans.  His expertise provides a critical perspective on affordable healthcare options for independent workers. He holds degrees from Eastern Nazarene College, Yale University, and Duke. I look forward to hearing from you today. Thank you for being here, sir. Chairman Cassidy, Ranking Member Sanders, and members of this committee, my testimony is intended to  illuminate briefly the small business needs for association health plans, otherwise known as AHPs, and the ways by which AHPs can satisfy those needs. My name is Kev Coleman. I'm a research fellow at Paragon Health Institute, an independent, nonpartisan policy research organization dedicated to reforming government and empowering patients. Prior to Paragon, I worked largely in technology startups, including co-founding Association Health Plans, Inc. My testimony today represents my views alone.  The National Federation of Independent Businesses 2024 survey reported health insurance cost remains, quote, the number one small business problem, a position it has held since 1986. For small businesses, the past decades have brought increased revenue or insurance expense and declining coverage availability for its workers. Almost half of small employers offered health coverage back in the year 2000, but by 2023, that percentage had fallen to 30%.  Within this period, there was also significant decline in the use of small group health insurance. National Association of Insurance Commissioners' data shows covered lives declined by nearly a third from 2014, the first year of Affordable Care Act small group insurance coverage, until 2023, the most recent year for their published data. Government data for this same period found small business cost of single coverage rose by 35 percent and family coverage rose by 37 percent.  AHPs offer relief to the situation. Technically, an association health plan is not a type of insurance, but rather a legal instrument by which a group of businesses can band together and cooperatively sponsor a single health plan limited to their own workers. Assuming their aggregated employees is of sufficient size, the AHP can access the large group health insurance market, a market that already covers over 80 million Americans.  There are many antecedents for AHP's cooperative arrangements, such as credit unions, professional employer organizations, and group captives. Such organizations employ similar strategies where demand for products or services is pooled among multiple businesses who voluntarily work together to secure lower prices.  A primary way large group health plans achieve savings is scale. For example, large group plans covering thousands of employees are in a better position to negotiate with insurers because a large plan offers an insurer a bigger risk pool over which health claims may be moderated. Large group plans also pay less for the same benefits because of rules on their medical loss ratios and practices around actuarial load.  In the brief 2018 period when reforms expanded AHP access, new AHPs provided both broad health benefits and double-digit savings. In my own research of nearly three dozen of these plans, the highest savings reported for a fully insured plan was 23 percent and 29 percent for a self-insured plan. Separate research found savings examples like the Tennessee Realtors AHP that reported savings of 25 to 50 percent.  Likewise, at the time, Avalere Health's market projections had predicted future AHP premiums were substantially lower than those in the small group and individual markets. The 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA, codified AHPs as a subtype of multiple welfare arrangements. In the decades since ERISA's passage, AHP regulation has improved consumer protections on the federal as well as the state level.  Congress amended ERISA in 1983 to give states authority to regulate self-insured AHPs. States, for their part, have enacted numerous laws and regulations to improve AHP governance and oversight in the decades since this amendment. On the federal level, HIPAA guarantees that an eligible employee may not be denied AHP coverage based on health factors. Specifically, it's prohibited from denying coverage based on health status, preexisting medical conditions or mental illness, medical claims history, and genetic information.  Opponents of AHPs have sought to prevent access to large group health insurance by small businesses. However, these foes of AHPs are oddly silent regarding why large group coverage is acceptable for big businesses, universities, and nonprofits, but not traditional small businesses and self-employed. This double standard is all the more problematic given the excessive insurance prices small businesses pay.  Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. Thank you. Senator Sanders to introduce his witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to introduce Tim Driscoll, president of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craft Workers. Mr. Driscoll first joined the Bricklayers Union in 1985 as an apprentice. He has served in several leadership roles with his union and was elected president of the Bricklayers in 2020. Mr. Driscoll, thanks very much for being with us today.  Thank you, Ranking Member Sanders and Chairman Cassidy. I'm here today on behalf of BAC, the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craft Workers. Today's hearing, as I understand it, is an examination of proposed legislation that seeks to address the accessibility, portability, and security  of benefits for workers and those who may indeed work for multiple firms and at times need to work across state lines. I'm well acquainted with the needs of such workers because BAC members, along with millions of other building trades workers, find it necessary to work for multiple employers, often across various jurisdictions, throughout the year. And the availability and security of benefits is a core concern for our members.  My union is dedicated to strengthening laws that protect workers and the benefit systems that they rely upon. Unfortunately, the Unlocking Benefits for Independent Workers Act falls short on both these counts.  Misclassification of workers as independent contractors is rampant in the construction industry and other sectors of our economy. It provides low-road employers the ability to mistreat workers as contractors, denies those workers the essential protections afforded to employees, and deprives state and local governments of the tax revenue that such employment should generate. The Unlocking Benefits for Independent Workers Act would only accelerate this insidious race to the bottom.  by providing unscrupulous employers a safe harbor under all federal laws when such companies provide employees any benefit or protection that's commonly provided to employees. This unnecessary expansion of independent contractor status would leave affected workers without the basic protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act and would make it next to impossible for them to exercise their ability to form unions or bargain collectively under the National Labor Relations Act.  This proposed legislation is an extreme departure from the benefits and protections that workers have relied upon for decades and is a thinly veiled attempt to weaken the rights of workers to join unions, to be paid fair wages, and to have safe working conditions.  Similarly, Senator Scott's Modern Worker Empowerment Act would narrow the test for employees under the FLSA to the usual common law rules and thereby expand the ability of unprincipled employers to misclassify workers as contractors. Congress was clear when it established the FLSA that people working for someone should enjoy the benefits and protections afforded by the act.  This broad scope laid out under the economic realities test has been established through decades of case law and rulemaking. However, the modernization promised by the proposed bill is an open invitation to opportunistic employers who would exploit workers and deny them the most basic protections that the Act guarantees.  Rather than spend time on disingenuous efforts, Congress should instead focus on passing the Protecting the Right to Organize, or PRO Act, so that all working people have the freedom to join together, negotiate with their employers for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.  Research consistently shows that when union density is strong, whether in specific regions or occupations, it leads to better wages, improved benefits, and a higher standard of living for entire communities. Unions achieve this by uniting workers to bargain collectively for improved standards at work, standards that benefit non-union workers as well.  Robust unions help set wages for entire industries and occupations. They reduce wage disparities by ensuring fair pay and bring living wages to underserved communities. Crucially for today's proceeding, the PRO Act offers vital solutions to the challenge American workers face. It guarantees bargaining rights for employees who are misclassified as contractors and establishes a process for helping newly organized workers achieve a first contract.  These are the real policy solutions that face American workers. These are the solutions that provide workers a real voice on the job and empowers them to secure the benefits they need. These are the true reforms that workers across our country need today. Thank you again for the opportunity to address the committee and speak on behalf of American workers this morning. I look forward to answering any questions that the committee may have.  Mr. Driscoll, thanks very much. I'd now like to introduce Karen Friedman, the Executive Director of the Pensions Rights Center. Ms. Friedman has worked for over 20 years to advocate for workers and retirees. The Pensions Rights Center conducts important work to find innovative solutions to the retirement crisis facing working Americans. Ms. Friedman, thanks very much for being with us. Thank you so much. Good morning, Chairman Cassidy.  Ranking Member Sanders and members of Congress, thank you so much for this opportunity to testify today about expanding coverage to the millions of private sector workers who are not now covered by an employer-sponsored plan. The Pension Rights Center, which was founded in 1976, is a national, nonpartisan consumer organization that works to promote and protect  the retirement income security of workers, retirees, and their families. We work on sort of two different directions. Our policy program works to identify and address gaps in the retirement income system and work for innovative solutions. Our legal program is the go-to place for individuals when they need help with a pension or a 401k type plan.  On that score, the Pension Rights Center is proud to be the resource center for six regional pension counseling projects, which provide free hands-on assistance to individuals in 31 states, helping them address their retirement income problems to ensure they get the benefits they've earned. Since the inception of the program, which is funded by the Administration for Community Living, the counseling projects have provided and helped  more than 70,000 people recovering some $294 million in earned benefits. PRC's passion and my passion is to help people and ensure that everyone can retire with secure income. Since our founding, we've heard from tens of thousands of people from across the country who tell us how they're suffering, struggling in retirement  because they cannot make ends meet. Why? Some don't have a pension. Many don't have enough money saved in their 401K plans, and an alarming number don't have a retirement plan at all. To top it off, the average monthly Social Security benefit in 2025 is less than $24,000 per year.  With so many people living on just that modest Social Security benefit alone, over 5.7 million older Americans are living in poverty. That's why it's so vital that we not only ensure pension coverage for all American workers, but we also need to work to strengthen and expand Social Security, which is America's most important anti-poverty program.  Just yesterday, I was talking to Cindy. She's a woman we've helped for many years. She lives in Kansas City, Missouri. She said something incredibly astute. And actually, it's very similar to what you said, Senator Cassidy. She said, Karen, when you're talking to the senators tomorrow, remind them that retirement security is not a partisan issue. It's not a Republican issue. It's not a Democratic issue.  It's an American issue. She continued, we are all united in wanting to have sufficient money after years of hard work so we could pay our bills, stay part of our communities, support local businesses and help our kids and grandkids. The great part is Cindy can do all that because her husband has a good defined benefit plan, which she thinks  everyone should have. According to the National Institute of Retirement Security, a poll that they did, people across party lines agree with Cindy, with 80% of Americans saying that all workers should have a pension so they could be independent and self-reliant in retirement. Sadly, that is not the case for most people.  In fact, polls show that running out of money in retirement is a top concern for all Americans. A poll from Alliance Life Insurance shows that 64% of Americans are more worried about returning without adequate income than they are about death. So that's a pretty amazing statistic. Unfortunately, the facts support people's fears. Just half of private sector workers participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan.  Even for those who are covered, there's been a dramatic shift from defined benefit plans, which provide secure, guaranteed lifetime income, to less secure 401K plans, where individuals are not saving nearly enough money to make it through retirement. To that end,  PRC has developed policy principles, which are included in my written statement, that we think should be used to evaluate any legislative proposal that aims at bolstering retirement income, particularly for low and moderate wage earners. In short, our top four principles for new proposals are these, universal coverage,  secure income, adequate income, and retired contributions from employers and employees. Ranking Member Sanders, we applaud you for introducing the Pensions for All Act, which embodies these principles. Your visionary bill is modeled on the pension plan provided to new members of Congress. I think that workers of all views appreciate the value of this type of pension and feel that every American deserves no less.  Your bill is aspirational and an inspirational challenge to all of us to think big. Thank you again. I guess I've just run out of time. Thank you again for inviting me today. Thank you. Thank you for inviting me today and I'm happy to answer your questions. Okay, thank you so much.  United here. Everybody wants the model of my office. We want to be pro-family, pro-worker, pro-patient. I think each of you could say that. Now, the question is, how do we get there? And we want that person, our fellow American, to retire with adequate benefits.  As an aside, by the way, Ms. Friedman, I agree with you regarding social. And one thing that we've ignored so far is that in eight years, there'll be a 20% cut by law in social benefits. Senator Kaine and I have a bipartisan bill that would attempt to address that, even increasing benefits for those at the lower income scale. That's not this committee, but I just want to mention that because Social Security getting a cut of 20% would be anti-worker, anti-patient, anti-family. So that said,  Now, I'm going to speak to the two of you, please. Senator Sanders pointed out some things we should be concerned about. Increasing wage inequality, disparity, and his prescription is as we heard. But in California, both of you referenced how AB5, ostensibly that was going to improve things for workers,  ended up with lower employment overall, not just among independent workers, but if I read your testimony correctly, Ms. Cavan, among union workers, too. Yeah, so why don't you start, Ms. Cavan, real quickly, because I have limited time, and just speak to what seemed to be, oh, we're addressing this, and probably California has the greatest disparity between CEOs and workers. We ended up with workers being worse off.  That's right. The union data that I cited came from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. And if you look at the chart, you can see the line going straight down. Talking about what I said in my opening statement about I went freelance because I thought I could earn more money, accurate. That turned out to be true for me. And it turns out to be true for a lot of people. One of the most recent studies that just came out on that  was Upwork, they looked at the skilled freelancers who are performing knowledge work. We brought in about $1.5 trillion in 2024, and more than a quarter of us in the United States are freelance. Those who earn exclusively through freelance work report a median income of $85,000, surpassing their full-time employee counterparts at 80,000.  Does that include the benefit of, Mr. Driscoll would probably ask, does that include the benefit of benefits? If you say 20% of your income goes towards benefits, is that 85K accounting and that differential accounting for the fact that the person who's full-time employed has benefits as well? Well, we have to pay for the, we don't get access to those good juicy group rate plans. That's what you're trying to fix and Senator Paul is trying to fix for us.  I actually brought my health insurance stub, my monthly pay stub that I have to shell out to get silver level, not even gold, Blue Cross plan in New Jersey, $999.87 a month just to get access to the healthcare. That's supposed to be affordable healthcare. No, it's not. And I took a little poll.  We have to buy individual plans. And I took a poll among independent contractors that I know. Some of them are getting jacked for $2,000 a month. If they have kids, $3,000 a month. Premiums. These are premiums. This isn't even going to the doctor and getting something done. And yeah, a lot of us do well as freelancers. And yeah, we have to pay more for the health insurance because the rules have to be changed. How would you comment upon this?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2541.052, "text": " I mean to the point that in California, you know, the fact that the original bill had to exempt over a hundred different occupations because it was so sweeping. And then even after that you have 600 occupations full of tens of thousands of Californians who are still under the gun of AB 5 and they have lost incomes.  They've lost contracts. They've lost livelihoods. They've lost small businesses. I've spoken to a woman who had a breast cancer survivor. She was raising three children while starting a business. And AB5 in 2019, it really helped to push her out of business. So when you talk about  mass reclassification, which is what this effort really is, it's a sweeping effort to try to consider every single independent contractor in every occupation as the same.

In fact, it is double what it is in most other countries around the world.

Ms. Kamen? I agree, not the way you're suggesting. Mr. Coleman?  I don't think the question really understands the philosophy of human rights versus localized... Despite the fact that every major country on earth guarantees health care to all people. Yes. Mr. Jusko? Health care is absolutely an essential right everyone's entitled to. Ms. Friedman?  Mr. Driscoll, you state in your testimony that the misclassification of workers as independent contractors is rampant in the construction industry and has led to a destructive race to the bottom. Please tell us how this has harmed construction workers and why you believe Congress should not make it easier for corporations to misclassify workers as independent contractors.  Currently under existing law, Senator Sanders, approximately 2.1 million workers are misclassified as contractors. So within my trade, a bricklayer working next to another bricklayer, working on a project that they have no control over, are often deemed contractors to avoid paying unemployment insurance, health insurance. That cost is ultimately borne by the community that those workers participate in because they cannot afford health care.  And it drives a race to the bottom where our employers, responsible contractors who provide health care and pension benefits, can't compete against these low-road contractors. This law, if enacted under its current language, would simplify that test and lead to an expansion of those type of contractor relationships.  President Driscoll, the bills we are discussing today would give companies a quote-unquote safe harbor that would allow them to deny workers a minimum wage, overtime, and the right to form a union. In your opinion, would these quote-unquote safe harbors help or harm workers? These would greatly harm workers, Senator. Ms. Friedman,  Astoundingly, again, we are the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and yet nearly half of older workers have no retirement savings. I've introduced legislation today that would bring back defined benefit pension plans for over 56 million American workers. What, Mr. Friedman, what would it mean if every American had access to a defined benefit pension like the one members of Congress have?  As I said in my statement, in my written statement, defined benefit plans, which are guaranteed plans that provide lifetime payments to individuals, have created a middle class in this country. If everybody had a defined benefit plan, then they'd be able to pay their bills, they'd be able to take care of themselves and not be a burden on society, they'd be able to participate  in community. I'm going to interrupt you here. Yeah, sure. Isn't it fair to say, and I trust that nobody disagrees with this, that if you are 60, 65, you're about to retire and you got nothing in the bank, which is the case for millions and millions of people, there is a tremendous level of anxiety. How do we survive?  Yeah, totally. And one of the astounding facts, we don't talk about it, I learned about it, Mr. Chairman, just last year when I was sitting where you are. 22% of seniors in America are trying to survive on $15,000 a year.  That's insane. All right. So what we are striving for here, and you tell me, Ms. Freeman, is a defined pension plan so that when people retire, they know what they're going to get also. Let me talk about Social Security. The chairman correctly mentioned we have a problem with Social Security. Right now, why don't you tell people if somebody is making $10 million a year,  and somebody's making $160,000, $176,000, who pays more into the Social Security Trust Fund? Well, if somebody, so the lower income person pays much, much more into Social Security, exactly. Because we have a cap. And what would happen if we lifted that cap for all taxable income  The legislation that I have introduced would greatly expand benefits and increase the solvency, the issue Senator Cassidy talked about, for 75 years. Does that make sense to you? Yes, it certainly makes sense to me. And the Pension Rights Center also thinks that it's a great idea. Senator, if I may just add, Social Security is this country's nearly universal pension plan. And it's completely portable. It's extremely efficient.  It's spending less than a penny on an administration of every dollar spent and returning more than 90 cents 99 cents of every dollar in benefits And these benefits have not been Thank you increase.

Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you and Ranking Member Sanders for this hearing. And to our witnesses, thank you for being here today, for sharing your experience and your expertise. I really appreciate it. I will just say, as we are discussing the importance of making sure that workers have access to health care, retirement, and other benefits,  It is worth pointing out that it's been less than two weeks since President Trump and Congressional Republicans unilaterally voted to take away the health care of millions of Americans. So I find a little bit of irony in this moment today.  I also really appreciate the focus on how to address the need to update our rules and laws to reflect a modern economy. But the thing is, the devil is in the details here, and the details really, really make a difference. Because if you have sat where I sat as governor of a state, and I've talked to a lot of people who have been forced into independent contract status,  That 18-year-old kid hired by a contractor up on a roof falls off the roof, breaks his back, and has no worker's comp and no insurance. So the rest of us bear the cost of that. That's a real issue that we have to think about and be careful about. And when we think about association health plans, we have to make sure they're not association junk health plans. Because if all you've got is people with  illness and injury in the pool, that's going to drive the cost of that pool up and they're going to discover they're not covered for a lot of things. So we got to get the details right here. Let me start with a question to you, Mr. Driscoll. President Trump's budget law will result in millions of Americans losing their health care insurance.  This bill will also cause health insurance premiums and costs to go up for patients who receive insurance through their job because the increase in the number of uninsured people turning to emergency rooms for care will drive up costs for all Americans. So Mr. Driscoll, how will increased health care costs impact the workers that you represent?  As you indicate, the devil is in the details. There's no question there will be cost shifting from what's projected to be the 20 million folks who will lose their health insurance coverage. And that will be the insured plans, such as ours, that will have to absorb those costs.  Insurance companies, providers are going to begin to need to drive up premiums in order to cover the uninsured costs. Ms. Friedman, women face many obstacles for saving for retirement, including that they're more likely to come in and out of the workforce due to caregiving responsibilities. According to a 2024 survey by the National Council on Aging, less than half of the women  and only one-third of rural women reported having saved for retirement. Can you speak to the unique circumstances that women face in saving for a secure retirement? Yes, thank you so much for that question, Senator. It's absolutely true. First of all, as I've talked about, our efforts are working to make sure that everybody gets good coverage, everybody has portability, and that's Senator Sanders' bill,  Pensions for All would certainly address that along with other approaches. But as you're saying, that the data is abundantly clear that women do lag behind men in retirement income outcomes. There's lots of factors at work. Women still earn less for comparable jobs. They take more breaks from the workforce for caregiving.  I know this because I was taking care of my parents. That leads to much lower lifetime earnings, which is going to affect how much they're getting. Widowhood, divorce, and separation can disproportionately affect women's retirement income. All of those are really important factors. Also, women tend to live longer, so they're going to have to make their retirement income last longer.  are happening that we need to address. And I just want to also say that the Patrick Wright Center supports Senator Baldwin's Women's Retirement Protection Act of 2025.  And that addresses some of the big concerns that women have. Thank you. I appreciate that. One last question for you, Mr. Driscoll. Union negotiated portable benefit plans to protect workers' rights while also supporting them with benefits that allow them to stay healthy, care for their families, and have flexibility in their work. What benefits do employers see with these types of plans, and how could we help more employers offer them?  Thank you, Senator. The beauty of these plans for our employers, and I want to clarify this up front, we have employers that employ hundreds, but in some cases we have employers who have three employees. They get access to affordable health care with low administrative costs that no small employer could take on. Growing the rate of unionization in any given area or any given occupation would give more employers access to the benefits that I think they genuinely want to provide to their employees."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 3592.33, "text": " Well, thank you.

Mr. Coleman, let's go to you next. I'm a big fan of association healthcare plans. It's something I fought for to help become a possibility. I've seen some acceptance of it. I'm surprised it's not more so, to be honest. What's keeping that from exploding in a good way, and what do we need to do to put wind beneath those cells?  Senator, thank you very much for that question. A primary obstacle to association health plans underneath legacy regulation deals with the obstacles to be able to form a  coalition of our association of businesses whose aggregate employee body can be seen as a single health plan. There's something known as the look-through doctrine, which says if you don't have the right affiliations among businesses, we're going to treat each individual business within an association as its own entity with respect to health insurance. And hence, if they have three people, they're in the small group of health insurance.  So is this a, we need to change the law or is it a regulatory issue?  Ultimately, changing the law is best because not only do you have the benefit of a very clear statutory precedent, but you also have a situation where technologists like myself or my former self are going to make investments in that market to build platforms, facilitating technology, et cetera, if it's a regulatory solution  there's more hesitation because there's the fear that the next administration may change regulation. Okay thanks and I would just ask the committee staff I'm sure you're looking at that but would love to kind of understand what we can do to to improve that situation as well. We've seen some great success in Kansas with some of these plans and again I'm surprised there's not more people utilizing it. I'll go to Ms. Friedman next and if you just briefly explain that  How under portable benefits can we ensure, can we be sure that employers are still providing benefits on par with many W-2 employees? I kind of messed it, let me say it again. How under portable benefits can we be sure that employers are still providing benefits on par with many of the W-2 employees? With portable benefits, well there's lots of, I mean look, portability has been an intractable problem in the retirement space.  There's lots of proposals that will address this. Senator Sanders pensions for all would be portable. The state facilitated auto IRAs has some portability. I think we have to ensure that we're looking at solutions. I mean, what we're trying to do is address a concern, which is portability, people changing jobs a lot and benefits going with them.  we need to be exploring those options and make sure that they're options that both protect employees and also. Thank you. So I understand the problem. Now I'm looking for the solution. Ms. Onwuka, can you take a shot at that?

I'm hopeful that this is one of those issues that we can have some great bipartisan progress on, because I think we all care about making sure that everyone in America has access to health care, but part of having access is being able to afford it.  we have a situation in this country where we spend far more. And it's not for lack of effort in terms of how much it costs to provide healthcare that we're in this challenge. 18% of our economy is committed to healthcare. That's $5.26 trillion a year, far outpacing per capita what any other country spends on healthcare. But it reminds me, I grew up very rural. It reminds me when I was a little kid, I went with my dad to buy a used car.  And when we walked up to the guy who had the car to sell, he said, my dad said, well, what do you want for the car? And he looked back and he said, well, how much do you have? Right? If you don't know the price of something, pretty hard to know whether you're getting a good deal, have a negotiation. In this country right now, we have no idea what we're paying for healthcare as consumers. Whether you're an employer, an individual, somebody buying a healthcare program, none of us know.  In most markets, we know. We know what the price is. We walk up, we know what the, not in healthcare. It's a mystery. None of us really know how much it is. And so that's, it seems to me that's a fundamental component of trying to figure this out. Mr. Coleman, you have thoughts on that?  Thank you so much for the question, Senator. I do have a lot of thoughts to that. I would say about 95% of my time now as a researcher is actually spent on the issue of the application of artificial intelligence within healthcare because it's one of the most promising mechanisms we might have to be able to curb healthcare costs. People tend to forget that our insurance costs are largely reflect... I'm sorry. Thank you, Senator.  People tend to forget that our health insurance premiums are largely reflective of the costs of medical claims, and we need to find ways to be able to reduce the costs. Right now, the costs of our hospitals, our physicians are way out of line with comparable nations in Europe. As you mentioned, 17.4 percent of our GDP is spent on health care.  we need to look at that healthcare delivery issue because that would really further enable the savings potential of the work we're discussing today on things like association health plans. Additionally, when you think about labor unions, they come together, they represent their members, they negotiate for better wages, working conditions, healthcare, all benefits. But as an individual independent contractor,  want to drive a car or have a small business? And Ms. Cavan, maybe you can answer this. Do I have the same ability to come together and negotiate under the law as you would as an employee in a business or a union?  You're talking about the health plans? Yeah, with health plans. We need better access to the group rates. Yeah. This is not my personal area of expertise, but just asking everybody knowing, you know, I've been an independent contractor for more than two decades now. We're getting killed on these individual rates, and we need equal access to the group rate plans. Yeah. Ms. Onwuka, do you have a thought on that?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 41, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 4447.166, "text": "Nothing particularly. They've said everything."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 42, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 4448.908, "text": "Yeah. Ms. Coleman?  I have much the same opinions that we need to find ways to be able to aggregate independent contractors so they have more leverage in negotiations on things like health insurance. Yeah, because if you want to get a better price, you have to have the ability to know what the price is and improve your negotiating power so that you can figure out how to get the best deal for yourself. Absolutely. It's literally the basis of the group health insurance market.  And we just, we need to do better on that front. I will, I just wanna just say that this is an issue of healthcare. When I think of small businesses, and we just passed, by the way, in the big beautiful bill, we helped social security, we helped small businesses, we helped people have more money in their pockets to be able to pay for out of it.  But health care is going up, the cost is going up so fast. And if you don't have the ability, I mean, you make so many decisions in your life as a family member based on whether or not you can have health care, where you're going, where you are, where you change. And I hope that Mr. Chairman, we'll work very closely together to improve the way that we're serving all of our customers, the people of the country. Thank you.  And I just want to note, Ms. Friedman has been saying that only 50% of workers have access to defined benefit or defined contribution plans. But I'll submit for the record a CRS report based on IRS data showing that almost 80% do. So just to point that out. Thank you very much, Senator Cassidy. I'd like to suggest that I'm talking about 50% who participate in a plan. If you're talking about access, it's a slightly different issue.  So yeah, I'd be happy to share that with you, but thank you very much. Next is Senator Blunt, Rochester."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 43, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 4566.878, "text": " Thank you, Chairman Cassidy, and thank you, Ranking Member Sanders, and to the panelists, thank you for being here."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 44, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 4573.407, "text": "Delaware has recognized how crucial continued access to benefits like retirement are to persons' economic stability and, as we heard, even the economic stability of families. I was really struck, Ms. Friedman, by the remark that you made  of individuals being more afraid of running out of money than dying, that really stuck with me. I can tell you this issue of making sure that, as you mentioned, Social Security was an anti-poverty program for our seniors, making sure that people actually can live out their lives with dignity and dignity.  and be able to feed themselves and be able to live is certainly important. And I will say in my state, in 2024, our Delaware State Treasurer rolled out a program called Delaware Earns, and it's a retirement plan that makes it easier for the 150,000 Delawareans without access to work-based retirement plans, including independent contractors,  to save for the future. Ms. Friedman, how common are plans like Delaware Earns, and are they generally successful? Thank you for that question. Yes. First of all, I want to say that the Pension Rights Center has been on the ground floor of supporting these approaches. So, we had a common ground initiative called the Conversation on Coverage in the early 2000s, and one of our recommendations was to do some sort of state-administered plan  We were involved early on with Washington, Connecticut, Illinois, and other programs. So there's probably about 20 states that have implemented this kind of plan. Again, they're modest. They're not Senator Sandersville, right? They're not offering defined benefit plans to everybody, right? But they're expanding coverage for private sector workers who now do not have access to an employer-sponsored plan.  So my understanding is that there's hundreds of thousands of now individuals who are participating in these plans, employers are getting more enthusiastic, and there's been about, I think it's about $2 billion saved overall. So congratulations on Delaware in setting up the plan, and we'd like to work with you in any way. There are additional protections we'd like to see in these plans. We'd like to be able to see the law changed on a federal level so that  employers can contribute, because certainly, as Senator Sanders pointed out, you really need, and this is part of our principles, you really need employer and employee contributions if you're going to try to get adequacy. Also, we're looking forward to seeing the savers credit that was in Secure 2.0 actually implemented. You're actually answering my next question. Oh, good. So, yeah, so because that is a government match,  for low and moderate wage earners in IRAs, 401K plans. And we think that's super important. We'd like to see Congress really working to implement the Savers match and even make it high, you know, expand it.  in terms of eligibility and also in terms of the amount. Can you talk about how the Savers Match would work in practice and why this is such a big deal for both the traditional employees as well as independent workers? Well, okay. I think that we're still waiting to see how it's going to work.  But the idea, I think, would be that if low- and moderate-wage earners put in money, then the government would match that. So, that becomes almost like an employer match. It's super important for low- and moderate-wage earners. It's something in the Patrick Wright Center, and most consumer, retiree, and other organizations have worked on for a very, very long time. We were really happy when it was passed as part of Secure 2. We now need to improve it. So, I think we have to work on what I would call  the incremental and the large, so, and that\ufffds where the Petra Knight Center is. So, we\ufffdre going to be doing a conference in 2026 as part of our 50th anniversary celebration, and we\ufffdre going to be continuing this dialogue. Thank you so much.  You know, I had the opportunity in my state to serve as the state personnel director, so the pension office was within our purview, and also benefits and dealing with benefits, and particularly health care as well is of concern to me, and I hope that we really take seriously  The fact that there are so many people in this country that still don't have access to affordable health care and that we continue to try to work together to make it strong. I think when we start chipping away at the Affordable Care Act and chipping away at Medicaid and chipping away, it moves us further away from our goal. Thank you. I yield back. Thank you, Senator. Senator Kaine. Mr. Chair, on this topic, I do think there are a number of areas where we can  We have been and can be bipartisan. There's some huge differences of opinion. With the chairman, he and I have bills together to focus on auto enrollment and private pension plans for folks who work with companies that offer them. We have a bill to change the mandatory age for if a company offers a private pension plan. Right now, it has to make that available to every full-time worker over age 21. We want to change it to over age 18.  We have social security proposals. So there is some bipartisan space, albeit some differences of opinion. Here today, it strikes me that on some big principles, we ought to be able to agree. Devil's in the details. One is a principle that I don't hear disagreement about among the panel, that folks who want to unionize and vote for a union should be able to have a union.  One of the reasons I decided to support the PRO Act is the fact that after a tough unionization campaign, so often workers who successfully vote to unionize, they never see a contract. The employer having lost the election just never enters into a contract. And that seems to completely cut against the notion of a workplace democracy where there's an election and then there's a consequence. But if workers vote to unionize, they ought to see a contract, and the PRO Act provides a mechanism for that to happen.  workers should not be misclassified as independent contractors if they're employees. And that happens every day in every state, including Virginia. I've seen examples of it. But I'm also sympathetic to the position that folks who really want to be their own boss and be independent contractors should be. And so that  a balance, not letting people get ripped off and pushed into independent contractor status, allowing people who want to be their own boss to be their own boss. Trying to find that balance is really important. Two of my three kids are artists, and they're just the classic  I mean, they wouldn't call themselves independent contractors, they would call themselves artists, and the way they make their way in the world is, you know, part-time jobs that don't have any benefits, and then sale of art, often through like an LLC or something they set up to do their artistic work, and then other  little gig work here and there. And that's what they want to do. They're not doing that because anybody's, you know, an employer is pushing them to do it. They're doing it because that's what they want to do. And I kind of really admired it. It's kind of a DIY, I want to be my own boss. And wanting to be your own boss, you know, it was a good thing. And so trying to find that balance between keeping people from being ripped off and preserving the ability of folks who want to be their own boss to be their own boss. I mean, I think that that's what we have to do.  The two most important benefits, if you just summarize it, that need to be portable are health and retirement. And I acknowledge what Senator Hassan said. We just take a huge step backwards on the health side with the reconciliation bill. The CBO estimate is about 16 million people will lose their health insurance, either because of changes to Medicaid or because of the changes to the premium support available under the Affordable Care Act.  The ACA creation of exchanges where people could buy insurance individually and get premium support if they were low income has been a huge boon, in Virginia at least, to innovation and entrepreneurship. People who were locked into a job, I really wish I didn't have to work at this job and I'm locked into it because I need health insurance, suddenly had the ability to go and buy health insurance and if they were starting out a business and they didn't have a lot of income, they could get premium support.  and premium support that would enable them to have insurance for their family. That's how my two artist kids get health insurance. They don't have an employer that gives it to them. They get health insurance because they go on the exchange, and with premium support, they're able to afford it. Insurance, at the end of the year, because of the expiration of some of the premium support that was put in place in the American Rescue Plan, is gonna get dramatically more expensive, and especially for young people.  for young working people, they're really going to see their premiums go up. And that's going to lock some people into jobs as employees when they would really want to be their own boss. So I applaud anybody who's going to bat for the artists and for the independent contractors. And I would just hope that you would be every bit as strong in supporting the availability of health insurance and premium support.  as we need to be, because we're gonna see a tsunami of people losing health insurance or seeing their premiums jack up by 50, 70, 80% when we get to year end. And that is cutting against a goal that we all share, that people should have portable benefits.  So that is my plea to everybody. And Mr. Chair, the last thing I'll say is this. I really wish this hearing was one where we were all sitting around a table and just like firing questions at each other.  This has been a good one, and a lot of ideas are out, and I'd like to interrupt somebody and challenge them, and I'd like them to interrupt me and challenge, so this is a, there is enough common ground conceptually with challenges on how do we find match on the details that sort of the traditional five minutes, and okay, now on to the next witness, doesn't necessarily get out what we need to get out, but I do think a panel like this and a discussion like this is really important.  Sometimes on the HELP committee, it's like health, education, labor, pension. You know, we don't really give the P in the HELP committee the attention it deserves, and that's why even after being on the floor till 2.30 last night, I was really glad that you had this hearing this morning. Thanks. Well, thank you for that, and in my sense from that, there's an incredible amount of common ground to help our fellow American. So, how do we get there?

We've seen the gutting and politicizing of the Merit Systems Protection Board, the NLRB, and the EEOC. And so this administration has targeted collective bargaining agreements in agencies that afford  workers due process. So today this committee, I believe, is considering legislation that would yet again undermine the American worker. So Mr. Driscoll, I have a question for you. The Senate just voted on a bill a few weeks ago that would kick millions of Americans off of their health insurance and increase costs for families. And now we're discussing a bill that would  I think further erode patient protections and increase health care costs. So can you just talk about unions again and help to educate the public about the way the unions every day work to fight for real health benefits and lower health care costs for their members and their families?  Yeah, thank you for the question, Senator. Also, Brooks. Yeah, the reconciliation bill is going to have devastating effects at the state level. As Senator Cain just referred to the support for state exchanges, which are critical not just for workers, but for independent contractors to access health care.  is going to be devastated. And in turn, those uninsured patients, because they will show up somewhere, they may not get their regular checkup, but they'll show up at the emergency room. And there's a bill to pay. And health care providers can't be doing that for free. They're going to look to other people with pockets. And that's going to be the insured plans that unions and their employers jointly designed to take care of that. So, yeah, we're going to bear the burden of that cost.  And as you've mentioned, you know, just kind of further building on that, the rising uncompensated care costs is something that's going to be really devastating to the whole system. And that, as well as the Republican reconciliation bill, will actually increase costs for working families with employment-based coverage. And can you just talk a bit more about how that costs? Because the whole theme is here that we are increasing costs for working people.  Correct. I note that the large agreement here today is the rising cost of health care and how pressing that is on families. And how we address that, I think we can agree on as a principle we should be getting what we actually do to arrive at that is going to be the key difference.  expansion of plans that don't provide for employee input, the actual beneficiaries, fiduciary obligations, union health plans actually have employee input into their design. That doesn't exist with some of these other health plans that are out there. I think we need to be careful.  in advancing a principle that at the same time should always preserve, do no harm to the existing systems. And that's my concern with what this legislation could do."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 49, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 5470.767, "text": "And finally, with the last few seconds that I have, you know, today's hearing is framed around benefits.

Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair and Mr. Ranking Member.  Hickenlooper just got in because they couldn't find my end of hearing notes. So what impeccable timing. Senator Hickenlooper.  Thank you, Mr. Chair. Appreciate your patience. Actually, I accommodate your lack of patience. You almost threw me off. Thank you all for being here. Appreciate all of your public service. This is a chaotic time in the workplace, as you all know, and we've spent a lot of time in our office working to look at how do we provide more secure retirement  futures for all workers, all different kinds. So let me start with Ms. Freedom and talk a little bit about our, we have a bill called the Retirement Savings for Americans Act. I don't know if you've had a chance to look it over, but you know, in Colorado, 80% of our workers work at very small companies. Either they're working for as gig workers or companies with less than 50 employees. They're less likely than those working in larger firms to have  literally any retirement savings through their workplaces. And when you add those very small businesses, add the gig workers to them, it becomes a significant liability to the future of Colorado and I would argue to our country.  Now, as a former small business owner, and I started a restaurant that brews its own beer, but we had a number of restaurants, it was really hard for us. We did put in a 401k program, but the cost for a small business was burdensome, to say the least. The Retirement Savings for Americans Act, I think, provides a real solution so workers without  access to an employer-based retirement plan would be enrolled in a plan similar to TSP that we have access to here in Congress and that most federal employees have access to. More importantly, these plans would be portable, would follow the workers for their entire lives. So, Ms. Friedman, how important is it that we expand access to retirement benefits for all workers? Thank you so much. First of all, Senator,  Do you have any of that beer here today? No, I'm only kidding. I could use one about that. No, I'm only kidding. Yeah, it's super important. As we've talked about today, we've talked about the fact that millions and millions of people, 54 million or something, don't even have any kind of retirement savings plan to supplement Social Security.  wrong in the richest country in the world that doesn't exist. So I want to say that, yeah, we commend you for introducing your bill. We are evaluating lots of bills right now based on our principles, some of which I put in my written statement. And we're looking forward to talking to you. We do support the state auto IRA bills, and we're  very much in support of the aspirations of Senator Sanders' bill. And so, yeah, thank you. Thank you. Appreciate that. And let me just put a final point on it. We've got 800,000 employees in Colorado that generally have nothing. They have nothing at present and really nothing in the works that will make sure that they have a  you know, a happy, safe retirement. And I think we need a number of more innovative retirement savings options so that, you know, this workforce of largely low income workers can have that opportunity. So if you're going to look at a bill like the Retirement Savings for Americans Act, which is auto enrolled, people would automatically become enrolled, the federal government would  pay the first 1% and then match their savings as they are able to save more. So how would a bill like Retirement Savings for Americans Act improve access to retirement savings for low and middle class employees, middle income workers, I guess I'd say. And within that, it's portable. It will follow them for their entire working careers.  Yeah, I mean, so again, we have to do more study on it, but it sounds like you're making a definite progress. And again, as I said in our statement, we're evaluating a number of proposals. There's the pensions for all proposal and your proposal and many others, and we look forward to working with you.  I'm out of time. So I have written questions, you'll all get your chance. I do want to emphasize that we spend about $276 billion a year in federal subsidies for retirements to encourage people to retire. And now when you look at when I started out in my IRA, my 401k, you're allowed to put $2,000 away and get that tax deductible to grow. Now it's close to $30,000.  And of that $276 billion a year that the federal government puts into subsidies for people's retirement,  16 billion out of 276 billion goes to the lowest 40% of workers. And so my argument is I think we could lower that from almost $30,000 a year for wealthy individuals, higher income earners, move that down to maybe 25,000, still very generous, but that would create the cushion that would allow us to put something like what I'm suggesting, that 1% going to every worker auto enrolled that would be portable for their lives. Anyway, I yield back before the hammer cuts me off.  I could see it coming. No, but actually I very much enjoyed your last comment, so thank you. Members, we'll have 10 business days for questions for the record. That's July 31st, 5 p.m. I thank my witnesses for being here. Again, I think it really was illuminating, so thank you.

Welcome to NewsNation. This is where right and left can come to just be reasonable. I see great irony in this situation where you've been told almost nothing, and yet the situation is so telling about everything going on in our politics. I'm talking about Epstein, of course.  Despite so little coming out about Epstein's death, his consorts, his universe, the reaction to it is a reflection of where we are in our politics, if not in our society. And by the way, I still see a difference with a distinction between those two. This country, the majority of us, still agree on most things.  We just have to get past magnified minorities that dominate our politics. It's because of them that we are in the Epstein epileptic fits.  distracted by a situation that doesn't really matter to the overwhelming majority of our of us in our lives in this country. Yes, I think the administration has screwed this up and owes MAGA folk explanations of previous promises. And they should fight the judges for what is redacted and release what they have. I believe that.  And I don't think it's going away. But it ain't the national debt. It ain't the economy. It ain't immigration. It's not an issue that affects us all for generations. It's a story that cuts right down partisan lines for absolutely no good reason.  It just cuts down partisan lines, because that's all we're about. The simple fact that we are in a binary battle to the bottom where everything gets processed as whether or not it plays to the advantage of one side over the other, even Epstein. Don't take my word for it. Look at the polling. Not big in terms of outcomes, but in terms of preferences in a moment, you can get something out of polling. 40% of Republicans support how Trump's administration handled Epstein. 36% disapprove. How?  How? When all of this negativity has been generated from within MAGA, how do you get to 40-something percent, almost 50 percent? And there's been obvious mishandling or non-handling of the situation up to this point. How can you be satisfied with the handling when there's been no handling?  because they stick with their side. Same explanation for polling on the Democratic side. Why would 83% of Democrats disapprove? Only 2% approve of the handling of Epstein. Since when? This issue has been nowhere on the left. Not for the membership, not for its leadership, and yet such extreme disapproval? Why?  because they are automatically reflexively against Trump's interests. And being satisfied with the handling of Epstein or anything good for Trump is anathema to the cause.  So we see one reality here, which is a reminder that you must reject this game of politics. And the majority has to reject what it watches and what it absorbs on social media and what it asks of its leaders. We have to push to get back to focusing on the interests of the many and not just the fanaticism of the few. You know who agrees with me, at least right now? The President of the United States.  The president is finally doing something on the Epstein case that I wish he would do on issues that actually matter a hell of a lot more, like economic policy, tariffs, immigration policy. He's telling the extremists.  who exist on harshness and far-out positions, basically, to F off. Now, this is new for Trump, telling the mega-MAGA to take a hike. So, he's kind of wading in, he's tiptoeing in, he's still trying to blame the Democrats for the Epstein situation, which ain't gonna work. But this is the first and certainly strongest rebuke we've heard from Trump of his own.  The Democrats' new scam is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein hoax. And my past, all caps, supporters have bought into this bull shizzle, hook, line, and sinker. Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats' work. I don't want their support anymore. Remember Andrew Schultz, Charlie Kirk, Joe Rogan, all the pod bros.  Past! BS! Weak! It's pretty ballsy for Trump to do that. Now, again, no way Democrats are to blame for Epstein, okay? You can blame them for jumping on the issue and trying to play it to advantage, but again, that's about hating the game, not the players, for me at least. This is going on because Trump courted extremists and harnessed their grievance and their disaffection, and that motivated the inception of MAGA.  No, what he's doing right now, I would argue, is the right thing on one level. I do believe he owes them disclosure. And transparency is something he campaigned on. We didn't get it with the UFOs. We haven't gotten it yet with JFK. Got Ana Paulina Luna tonight to talk about that representative out of Florida. There's been an advance there. We'll have it. But now you're not getting it with Epstein. So I get them being pissed off.  But this is risky for Trump because, as I've argued here before, MAGA is bigger than him. And this issue, as we saw with the vaccines and other deep-seated conspiracy, they care more about satisfaction of their cause than they do about who gets the glory. Now, with the caveat that Trump likely cannot bully the mega MAGA into forgetting about Epstein,  He can recognize that he can do this. He can forget about the loony, the loony loomers, the Kellys, the pod bros, the fickle fanatics. He doesn't have to cater to them.  I know the media likes to pick up on social media and it's this kind of incestuous cycle, but it's not really tapping him into the majority, not really. But he can do that, reject the extreme within your ranks on the real issues, immigration and the economy. If he adopts this, I don't need people who are irrational to support me mantra on those issues, we could actually make some progress.  Look at immigration. Same poll that I was reading to you earlier found that 39% of voters approve of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws. 57% disapprove. Why? Because this extremist deport them all mentality is not capturing the majority interest in this country.  Yes, we want law enforcement. Yes, the southern border was porous and a joke and it devastated Democrats in the last set of elections. But not everyone who crosses illegally should be judged the same. That's not me saying it. That's most of us, as you just saw in the poll. So there is a middle ground on deportations, a rationality. Polls show  Most Americans broadly favor deportations as a function of law enforcement. I get it. I've never said anything else. But that number of approval drops precipitously when for migrants who've been here for years, married to U.S. citizens, have a job, have no criminal record.  Then we can make some actual progress, because we can get away from the absolutism of this extremism, of what ICE is being made to do, and just focus on the bad hombres, not the headcount, quality over quantity. Instead of demonizing people who come here to work and build our country, we could form a really quick consensus on making ourselves safer, but also stronger, with whom we allow to stay, rather than just focusing on who we can force and how many we can force to leave. The same is true in the economy.  If Trump can get away from this romanticism of the extreme and going all in on one direction, the biggest tariffs, the most on everybody, everywhere, all at once, like that lousy movie, he could take something like that, what we learned about the economy this week, and work with both sides to get us to consensus.  Inflation is showing signs of flaring up, and we know why. There's price pressure. And there are other early signs of pressure, like these about the tariffs, like the PPI. Now, I know the producer price index. I know that people on the right are telling you it's proof of a boom. They're wrong. Why? Now, first, let's deal with where we are on this.  On tariffs, 39 percent, just like with immigration, say Trump's strategies on the tariffs are working. Fifty-three percent say they're not. You see where the majority is in this country? You see where those who want reasonable is? Where we are. Again, it's a party-line litmus test. Eighty-four percent of Republicans say the tariffs are working. Ninety percent say they're not. You see, you've got to get away from these extreme reckonings of us and them.  There's clearly a middle ground in how to approach rebalancing trade and manufacturing relationships that we have with the world, right? They dizzy you with data when it comes to the economy. That's why Harry Truman famously said, give me an economist with one hand, because they're always giving you another version, but on the other hand, but on the other hand, but on the other hand. So this is an issue of the economy that you can twist like no other.  But I'm telling you what this PPI is. It's not sign of a boom. The producer price index, okay, showing that prices are down a little bit, you know what it's a sign of? Producers with deep pockets, the big companies, not small businesses, which are suffering with tariffs right now, they front loaded inventory when they first heard about this. So we are seeing them pricing the last batch of goods that were priced at the old cost structure. And because  This administration catered to the extremists in terms of finding waste, fraud, and abuse in that fiasco that was Doge. We're not even sure if these PPI estimates and the inflationary estimates are right. You know why? They cut so much meat out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  that are really important to capturing an accurate understanding of our economy, that now we're working off estimates a lot more than just actual data. It used to be that 10% of the data analysis was based off estimates instead of crunching the raw data. Now it's over a third because of cutbacks, which makes our understanding of the economy even less certain. Bad time for that. And then there is the reason that Trump should take this lesson of Epstein  which is one, you better do what you say you're gonna do, and you better put out what you have. Transparency matters, especially in terms of building trust, and we need that in this country as much as anything. But there's an even better reason that may matter even more to this particular president as to why he is right to move away from the extreme. Okay, automatically, politics is always about building your base and then moving towards the middle, right? That's the difference between primary and general, all right?  That's just become much more exaggerated with Trump at MAGA, but now that he's done getting elected and he's thinking about how he'll be remembered, all this harshness, all this extremism that his administration has been heavy on, all this division, you cannot find me one great president in American history who is remembered for how he divided us. You wanna be on the wall? You wanna be on the mountain?  If you want to be on the wall, you got to be about us all, not just the furious few. I wonder if Trump has learned something from this, because if he does, there could be very, very big moves ahead. Now, today, the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took part in the Hill Nation Summit. This was a big deal for NewsNation, by the way. NewsNation's Blake Berman asked her about whom their department is targeting. Take a look.  Among those, again, roughly 320,000 who are not known criminals, who are not violent criminals, and are undocumented and working at farms, is the expectation, Secretary, that those individuals as well will be deported?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 752.765, "text": "Well, there will never be amnesty under President Trump.

And if you do it twice, it's a felony. So, yeah, everybody who enters illegally is just that, having entered illegally. But they're not all the same. And I know you know this. But I don't believe that what the secretary just articulated there is what the president is saying. He has said that the people working on the farms, the people working in hospitality, that there are people in these communities that are good, that have done the right thing, even if they came in the wrong way. And you see in the polling  that people do not favor what they are seeing.

And I think the president's on key. I mean, he says we won't prioritize public safety threats and national security threats. Now, I looked at the numbers this morning. I see the numbers every day on the border, interior enforcement. So, numbers this morning, ISIS is right around 130,000 interior arrests in interior United States, 90,000 of them.  are criminals. So 69.23%. 70%. So 70% of everybody we're arresting is a criminal. Then you look at, and I saw News Nation put a stat up today about how many people in detention weren't criminals.  But they need to understand, there are non-criminals in detention because they're mandatory detention, such as expedited removal cases, mandatory detainment by law, by statute. And so, for instance, over 200 Iranian nationals were arrested in the last two weeks, national security threats.  So, you've got to separate the two by who we're arresting, and you can't compare the two about the percentage of people we're detaining, because we detain more than criminals based on a mandatory detention statute on national security and expedited removal. But I think the big part of this, there's a lot of media out there.  that tells a bad story about us. They want to talk about the one or two cases where, look, it's emotional, it's controversial. I get it. I've done this a long time. But they're not getting the real facts on the percentage of criminals we're arresting, how much safer we're making the community, and talking about all the bad people that we have arrested, significant public safety threats, national security threats.

Tom Holman, UBU, and we'll keep talking about the policies that are in play and their arguments to be made, and we'll keep making them. Thank you very much for giving us that opportunity.  All right, four minutes and 35 seconds. Absolutely, Tom. So look, he's right to not get ahead of the president. I believe he's right, and I've heard that suggestion before. Round them all up, wherever they are, they are. I don't think that's going to stay the policy because it's not what the majority wants, and I don't know that it's best for the country. Trump turned on Mega Maga today with this Epstein stuff. What does O'Reilly make of that play? What does he make of the plus and the minus of it? But wow, look at that jacket.  Stephen A rubbing off on the big boy. Next.  All right, let's bring in the big man, Bill O'Reilly. Bill, I've been listening to what you've been saying about Epstein. I mean, you know, you and I see it largely the same way. I'm not fascinated by this issue. I get why supporters of the president expect it a lot more than they're getting. I think he should be having his people be more aggressive in terms of explanations and disclosures. But what do you make of his really first time I've ever heard him push back on the base and say, if you're really going to buy into this BS, I don't need you? What do you make of that?  He's taking it personally. And when Donald Trump takes the criticism personally, that's what he does. But let's cut through this nonsense and break some new ground tonight, Cuomo. I know you like breaking new ground, OK? Number one, there's a positive aspect to this story that's totally overlooked. And that is that the American people do not want favorable treatment being given to the rich and powerful.  Richard Nixon found that out. Okay, that's a real plus and that cuts across ideological lines So it's a good thing because we don't live in a oligarchy here where the rich and famous get away with everything and they're not held to account People want to know what the deuce happened and they should want to know nothing wrong with not wanting to know number two  It's a lot of politics injected, because that's what, as you say every night, that's what the country's about. So, for four years, Merrick Garland had these files, or whatever they are. Maybe they're not files. Maybe they're just loose-leaf sheets of paper. I don't know what they are. He had them for four years. Our pal Mo Rocco, who I like, California congressman, Democrat, said not one word.  more years, yet now he's introducing a bill to force President Trump to release everything. No redactions, nothing which is insane. Mo Rocca is the media critic. Roccana is the member of Congress. Did I say Rocca? Okay, Roccana. You know, these Italians, it just gets me. Roccana, I wish he was Italian. He would raise our IQ level four points.  Well, he wishes he were Italian. So, immediately, it's politicized, and it's foolishness, because Congress can't force President Trump to release anything. They can't. I mean, it's not in the Constitution. But they're just doing this to embarrass Trump. And that's what really teased Trump off.  That's the essence of the story. He knows that the opposition is using this bunch of phonies, because they didn't care about it for four years, to try to hurt him. And then his own people, his loyal people, are helping, helping the people that want to hurt him. So he goes, I don't need you. OK. All of this could be put to bed in half an hour.  where Pam Bondi gets out there with Merrick Garland, who probably wouldn't show up. And if he did, he'd take the fifth, as all the Democrats are doing now in the House hearings about Joe Biden. But you can put a chair and Merrick Garland's picture, tape it to the chair. And then Bondi says, here's what we found out.  in a general way. I'm not giving names, because at this point there's nobody under criminal investigation, and so it's not fair. So no names. But here's what we found out, questions from the audience, and the audience asked questions. They'll be stupid questions, because the press is generally stupid. And Bondi should be able to just float right above it.  And just say, this is what we found out. We want to have reassurance to the American people that we're not favoring any corrupt rich people. The key to this is Alan Dershowitz. He's the key. So he writes a piece in The Wall Street Journal that says, I'm  Epstein's attorney. I was privy to every single blanking thing. The man thought, the man said, the man had. No famous people involved, okay? No political component. This is Dershowitz, all right? And probably no organized files or videotapes in a bedroom or anything like that. So I believe Dershowitz when he says that, right?  And I'm going, all right, so there's no story as far as scandal is concerned. Prince, what's his name over in England? Andrew. Andrew. He's already done. They finished him, and probably rightfully so. Bill Clinton's got a little deficit. But unless there's real hard evidence,  I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear innuendo. So when I'm a fair person and I put all of this together and I say to President Trump, just have Bondi do the press conference the way we've laid it out, and that's it, then you never have to talk to it again. Make sense? Makes perfect sense. And I think they should have done it already. I love that.  I think it should be done the same time as them going to these two judges that Dershowitz refers to, Berman and the other one, and says, why did you redact these things? Unredact them. And have it out in court. And then you at least show that you're trying to do something. I don't like that.  I don't like that. I don't want to destroy human beings because it's so irresponsible. Can I get on to Homan and immigration? So here's something nobody knows. I talked to Tom Homan yesterday, who I like a lot.  And the conversation is about a guy who lives in Peterburg, New Hampshire, Peterborough, New Hampshire. And he went to Canada with his kids, and they won't let him back in because he had a pot beef eight years ago. And I said, look.  You know, we have to use here common sense. We have to. This guy is now in the wind someplace up in New Brunswick. He can't get back to New Hampshire. This is not right. And Homan listened very, and I sent him all the data on it. Maggie Hisson, a senator, you should get her on. It's a work in a case. The guy will get back. But here's what should happen, and this crazy thing, because this makes us look bad in front of the whole world.  Number one, Congress should pass a law. Now, Trump should design the law, what he wants to see, because he's the president. First part of the law, everybody here undocumented has to register within 90 days with the federal government. You have to, through the post office. If you don't, you're deported immediately. You don't pass, go, boom, out. That makes it a lot easier on Tom Holman and a federal government.  When you do register, that gives the government a chance to evaluate who you are and what you are doing. If you have a Social Security number, you have to put that in there. OK? Then we have an orderly process. So the criminals, the MS-13s, they're not registering, Cuomo. They're not. The dope dealers aren't registering. You know? Hey, if you want some crack, go visit me in Tucson at this address. Not going to do it.  Why can't the country get together and do this common-sense stuff? Why not? Why is it always chaos and accusations and all of this nonsense? I don't know. I do, because it plays to their advantage against the other side. The problem works better than fixing it. And if we can change that, if people can get a different mentality of their expectation from leadership, then they'll do what you're talking about.  Republicans would be very wise, and so would Donald Trump, to get back a new immigration law that extends green cards for the industries that need it. But the most important thing is you register. And if you don't, Tom's coming to your house. Put Tom's picture in every post office. You don't register, he's coming to your house. And who wants that, okay?  Tom the Boogeyman Homan. Bill O'Reilly, thank you very much with that resplendent jacket that you have on tonight. Stephen A will be jealous. You know, this is my day job. Four minutes, yes. Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't change, but this is my day job.

That's a big deal.  Yeah, big deal. You're kicking my butt. I gotta jump. Four minutes and 30 seconds. Bill O'Reilly continued success. Up next. So, one of the things that's going on within the immigration system that you probably haven't heard about, and it involves law enforcement, the few, not the many, but it turns out that there's another layer to the scam.  Three police chiefs in Louisiana have been charged with selling fake crime reports to help, in quotes, hundreds of illegal migrants avoid departure. Why? Because of a loophole in the law. But these guys are doing it for profit, not because it's right. I'll explain it to you, and we'll figure out what to do about it next.  There's a scam involving law enforcement and illegal migrants. It's been going on for nearly a decade. Most are just hearing about it right now. Why? FBI investigation in Louisiana. They say chiefs accepted bribes for claiming hundreds of illegal migrants were victims of armed robberies, but the robberies never happened. Why would they do that? Because being a victim of a serious felony like that qualifies migrants for a U visa and allows them to stay.  Retired Homeland Security Investigator Victor Avila has heard of this, and former FBI Supervisory Special Agent James Galliano. Jimmy understands why this matters and what has to be done about it. Gentlemen, thank you. So, Victor, you've heard of this before. You've dealt in this area of trafficking a lot. And you say that's the sweet spot, where you have to examine how this type of fraud happens in trafficking, because that's such a big part of movement of people in and out of this country illegally. Why?  Because it's a loophole that they've been using. And this U-Visa scam has been going on for a long time. I saw it firsthand many, many years. I used to issue these U-Visas for victims. When they were human trafficking victims, we got them a T-Visa, which is a little bit harder to prove and harder to attain. But the U-Visa became this kind of a loophole where if you couldn't get any other kind of visa,  Well, maybe you were a victim of a crime, whether family violence, a rape or something like that. By the way, most of the recipients of your visas are females, but there's males as well, but mostly females. And you have a lot of these groups, ACLU, other non-governmental organizations kind of helping these people. And I remember being in El Paso, Texas, investigating these cases and thinking,  Are all these people actually, you know, were a victim of a crime? And if so, exactly what happened in Louisiana, where's the police report? Because that would help them prove if the crime happened in the United States, when they claimed that it happened in their home country, well, that would be even harder to prove.  and get documentation, and then this whole scam. By the way, Texas has been looking at this for a while. I just talked to a news organization here in Texas. It is getting out of hand. And I think you have to go back and review the issuance of these U visas, because what we want is the actual victim to get the visa, not these scammers. And I'm very disappointed, obviously, with the law enforcement involved here.  Gags, obviously, the temptation is to say, oh, they must all be doing this. Cops are dirty. They're on the take. But you say, if you look at how the DOJ approached this, there is an understanding that this is pretty limited in their context."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 2047.475, "text": " Chris, completely disheartening for law enforcement folks like me to hear of something like this.

Visa fraud, you're looking at potentially 10 years. Those could be served concurrently. And then you know how the feds are, Chris. We always throw in the conspiracy because where two or more are gathered, they're in agreement. There's an intention to do something like commit fraud against the United States.  And then lastly, an overt act is committed. Chris, I guarantee you, at least one of these guys is going to be singing, but I am heartened that the acting U.S. attorney did state that this was not indicia of a problem within the police department.

How'd the subway dude get caught up in this? Everybody's a chief or a sheriff. How'd they get the subway dude, Patel, in here?  Money laundry, money laundry. You think of any business, if you think about it, the cartels and these criminal organizations have used sandwich shops and car dealerships. If you can imagine it, they've used it to launder their money. I have a feeling Subway got caught in all this. But remember, the U-Visa, I want to make something clear, the U-Visa is an immigration benefit.  that benefits an actual victim that has been victimized and merits to stay here in the U.S. because the U visa brings very, very good benefits and a possible path to a green card and maybe citizenship. That's why it's being exploited. That's why these guys made a bunch of money. And I can't believe that they doctored the actual crimes to make them qualify for these benefits.  It's unfortunate, and I agree here. It's a black eye for the law enforcement community every time we see something like this. And they'll reveal them now, and we'll see what they had. Jimmy, those guys were going to Subway, but they were getting a different kind of sandwich. They were getting a different sandwich at that Subway, Jimmy. They were getting a cash one, not a turkey one, Jimmy. All right, James Galeano, thank you very much. Mr. Avillo, appreciate you very much.

They want a little bit of the sandwich. He was saying they wanted a payoff. All right, there may finally be real evidence that the CIA engaged in a cover-up, lied to Congress in connection to the broader context of the JFK assassination. What does that mean? What has really been advanced here?  Florida member of Congress, the dogged Anna Paulina Luna, says she has the goods and there is more to come. She makes her witness next.  All right, everyone is accusing the Trump administration right now of not being transparent, but there is work being done. Florida Representative Anna Paulina Luna, Republican, has been fighting for transparency when it comes to UAPs, but also on the JFK assassination. She's got new information that claims that the CIA engaged in the cover-up, lied to Congress about their association with Lee Harvey Oswald. She is here to explain. Representative, thank you for making the time. What do people need to know?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 2263.677, "text": " Hey Chris, so this was probably one of the biggest breaks in the JFK assassination in the last 60 years. A lot of people will say that this is largely contributing to the mosaic that's been put together, that the CIA did indeed engage in a cover-up. So there's something released by the CIA, so kudos to Director Radcliffe, called the Joe Nides files, and what the Joe Nides files revealed  is that Oswald was indeed in contact in many ways and being observed by the CIA in the weeks leading up to the assassination of JFK. So, it disproves the lone gunman theory. Also, in addition to that, Joe Nides was actually using a cover name, lied to Congress about it, and then was the go-between between the congressional investigations and the CIA. And so he was intentionally stonewalling the investigations pertaining to the JFK assassination.  And then in the personnel file that we obtained was actually then later on awarded a basically an award by the CIA for intentionally stonewalling these investigations. So what I will tell you, Chris, is not only do we have admissions from a witness that stated that when Kennedy was brought to the hospital, that he was shot from both the front and the back, meaning there are multiple shooters. We also have now  evidence that the CIA lied, undermined and intentionally gave Congress false information. And, in addition to that, we have proof that the Warren Commission omitted evidence. And so everything that we have had, basically, the ability to research in the last couple of months pertaining to JFK, does prove that the federal government, rogue factions within the CIA engaged in a cover-up of the assassination. And not just that, Chris. I guess I will break it here first.  We have obtained information that the previously hidden files that the KGB actually had on JFK will be released sometime in the fall time period for the American people to go through themselves and actually I've been told that the KGB had actually observed Oswald in Russia when he was there as a citizen and he was actually not a good shot at  And this is not also the only piece of information that we have. We actually have multiple witnesses that stated to the Warren Commission and different investigators that Lee Harvey Oswald was not seen in the book depository. So, as you're seeing, the ravel on who exactly shot JFK and the whole story that was the official narrative has been blown to pieces within the last week."}, {"keywords": ["Trade", "Tariffs"], "line": 22, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 2404.39, "text": "Good for you, Luna.

And so I'm sure that you'll see that information coming out here pretty soon. But actually, back in the 90s, during one of the third investigations actually to JFK, Congress had actually reached out to the Russian government for those files. And unfortunately, they were not able to obtain them. And now there is some level of  communication. And so as a result of that, that information will now be available in the coming months to the American people and also to JFK researchers. So from a historical standpoint, what I've also been told is that shortly after the assassination of Kennedy, actually at the funeral, the Russian government did hand over documents to the American government, and we were not able to obtain those documents in our request.

President Trump's irritation over the Epstein files. Can he quell the ongoing MAGA rebellion?  Plus, Mr. Mamdani goes to Washington.

And later, we return to East Palestine, where new documents appear to show skewed testing and cherry-picked data, concealing the true level of toxins. Just how bad was it? And how bad is it still?  Happy Wednesday, everybody. Great to have you here, and we have lots to get to, but we begin tonight in Washington, D.C., where some of the biggest names in government gathered for the first-ever Hill Nation Summit today, a partnership between NewsNation and our colleagues at The Hill. We've got big headlines from former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy,  top Senate Democrat Mark Warner, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who sounded the alarm on China and that country's threat to our electrical grid and water systems. Let's first go to The Hills' Michael Schnell, who today moderated many of the sessions. Michael, you were there. Lots of names, lots of headlines. Break it down for us.  Yeah, hey, Elizabeth, good evening. A lot of news out of Washington, D.C. tonight, over throughout the day. From this Hill Summit, where a number of our reporters sat down with lawmakers, members of Congress, lawmakers and administration officials to talk about a lot of different topics. I personally spoke to Congressman John James. He's a Republican from Michigan, currently serving in the House, who's running to be the next governor of Michigan. I pressed him on why he thinks he is the right person for that job.  And if he has any apprehension about President Trump's tariffs, particularly those auto tariffs, given he hails from Michigan, which is the automobile capital. I also spoke to Congressman Byron Donalds. He's a Republican from Florida. He is additionally running for governor in the Sunshine State. I asked him about that bid, as well as some issues in the House chamber right now dealing with cryptocurrency legislation.  And I also asked him a lot about Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell. Byron Donalds sits on the Financial Services Committee. He previously worked in banking and the finance industries. So he had an interesting view into the matter. But one of the most fascinating interviews today had to be  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Christine Noem. She had sat down with our Blake Berman to discuss DHS and TSA and everything you could think of throughout this conversation. There were two bits, though, that really caught our eye. First, talking about the electrical grid, and second, talking about what Americans do every day walking through the airport. Take a listen.  I would say our critical infrastructure is extremely vulnerable. One thing that the Department of Homeland Security did not do well under the last administration was to protect our electrical grid. We did not protect people's personal information. China proved that they can hack into our electrical system and shut it down. They can shut down our water system. The future of an airport, where I'm looking to go, is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your flight."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 238.886, "text": "Just like that?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 239.487, "text": " It takes you one minute to get there."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 241.172, "text": "How far away are we until that?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 242.896, "text": "I'm working with several different companies with technologies to give us competitive bids on what they actually can do.

So, Chris, you know I'm signaling there could be a change on the horizon. If only, I hope so. Michael, Jeffrey Epstein was also the talk of the town there on the stage. You heard from two lawmakers at the summit about that controversy.  Yeah, so of course the Jeffrey Epstein saga has been consuming Washington, particularly the Republican Party, as folks debate whether or not those files should be released. What happened to Epstein when he was in jail? We were able to ask two key lawmakers about this topic. First, Congressman Jim Jordan. He is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. As we talk about potential investigations and testimony from some people involved with Epstein, that would likely fall under Jordan's purview.  We got to ask him about that. We also spoke to Congressman Ro Khanna. He's a Republican from California. He sits on a number of committees that would look into this. He also commented on the Epstein saga, as we're seeing this effort by Democrats to embrace this and push for the release of the files as it continues to fracture the Republican Party. Take a listen to what Chairman Jordan and Congressman Khanna had to say.  We think we've got dates already scheduled later this summer. Well, they'll be in front of the committee, and I've told everyone, you can ask them. You know how those things go. Yeah. Republicans are going to have questions for them. Democrats are going to have questions for them on this issue and a host of other issues. And so we've already been working on that. And I think that's how it should proceed.

Now, as much as President Trump would like this to go away, this Epstein controversy does not appear to be doing so. And giving the matter more urgency is the dissatisfaction from the American public. According to a new poll out today, more than six in 10 voters disapprove of the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein investigation. Republicans in particular are split, 40 percent approve, 36 percent disapprove.  Let's get reaction now from News Nation political editor Chris Starwald, host of The Hill Sunday. Chris, great to have you here. So Trump is accusing Democrats of stoking this conspiracy, but it was President Trump himself who said for years there was a secret file that the government was covering up. His own son, Don Jr., tweeted out during the campaign, show us the Epstein files now. Why are they protecting this scumbag?  The president was careful around the Jeffrey Epstein stuff. He was notably careful for a guy who said that Ted Cruz's father maybe was part of killing JFK, for somebody who said Barack Obama was a secret Kenyan, for a person who, with political rivals and insensitive situation, who said Joe Scarborough maybe had something to do with the death of an intern. Donald Trump  showed restraint around the Jeffrey Epstein stuff. And it was because, I assume, he and Epstein were running buddies back in the day, right? In the 90s, in Palm Beach, in Manhattan, they were men about town, they were friends, they ran in the same circles. And Trump didn't want to get too close. And we remember when Maxwell was pleading guilty and going to prison, they asked the president at the time,  Well, what do you think about that? And he said, well, I wish her well, and he stepped back. These were all signals to the MAGA universe. We're not doing this one, guys, right? This isn't one for us. This isn't like Hillary Clinton's servers. This is one that we're gonna tread lightly around. And where he finds himself now, you know, when I asked Jim Jordan about this,  Jim Jordan was noncommittal about whether he believed the Biden administration's findings that corroborated what the first Trump administration said. But I don't think he believed the Biden administration. I don't think Jim Jordan took the Biden administration's word for what happened here. So when the president tells, whether it's Jim Jordan or whomever, stop talking about this, don't ask about this, I think he's asking the impossible.  Well, it's interesting though. Jim Jordan told you, I'm going to call Pam Bondi here and she's going to answer every single question about this, which is essentially what should happen if you want this to go away. I mean, the only way at this point to handle this is to release everything you can and answer every single question everyone has.  Well, there were two realities. There were two possible realities. Reality one was the Occam's razor answer, was that whether it was Donald Trump Jr. or Pambani or Cash Patel or whomever, that they had exaggerated what was going on. They had overhyped and overblown the conspiracy for electoral purpose, that it was good. You could score points on Democrats and say bad stuff about the Clintons and do this stuff. And then you get in office and you say, well, womp, womp.  sorry guys, it's not actually that way. And what can we say? Sorry, we'll, we'll get them next time. There's that version. And what Democrats are doing about that is very cynical, right? Because they believe what the Biden administration said. They believe that there's no there there. They just want to force Republicans to say it. They want them to say that, that it was a scam.  The other reality is that there is something being covered up and there is something being hidden. The president is trying to offer a third way out for Republicans, which is there is a cover up. But what we're it's a virtuous cover up. We're preventing fake things from the Democrats, from the bad people, from coming out because it'll hurt people. And if we think back to the infamous interview that the  then candidate now president did when he was asked will you release the files from the Kennedy assassination will you release the files on that yes yes yes Epstein well there's fake stuff in there and it could hurt people very a great deal right so this is where the president finds himself now  Right, but members of his own cabinet were saying quite the opposite. I'm going to release those files. There's a secret file. He didn't kill himself. And now they find themselves in the position of saying what the Biden administration is correct. He did, in fact, commit suicide.  Or they're covering\u2014 Or they can say what the president said, which is, thank goodness that we've stopped the release of these files because it contained fraudulent information planted by the deep state, etc., etc., etc. So we're doing\u2014we're not releasing it, but we're doing a good\u2014our lack of transparency is virtuous lack of transparency.  I don't know if that washes, but it may be enough. It may be a narrow enough space where enough of the folks in the cabinet can hide. So here's what Politico writes today. Quote, this blunder was entirely self-inflicted and that the most senior law enforcement officials in the country have been evasive, defensive and intemperate in their handling of the fallout.  Ardent Trump supporters like Laura Loomer are warning today that the meltdown threatens to consume Trump's presidency. When you have, people are the worst, we're the worst. Because when you have a story that is about sex and power and fame and it's lurid, right? This is like something out of a novel. And when you have a story like this, it's very hard  for people to let it go. And you can ask Bill Clinton, you can ask Warren G. Harding. We can go through a long list of presidents who, when sex becomes part of the story, and it becomes this sort of lurid story, it's a lot more interesting than regular corruption, and it's very hard for people to let that go.  Yeah, well, it's interesting. President Trump said this afternoon that instead of Epstein, everybody should be focused on President Biden's use of the auto pen to sign many of the pardons he issued late in his presidency. Trump calls it the biggest scandal in American history. Congressional Republicans are, of course, investigating this. President Biden says, I verbally approved all these pardons and somebody went and used the auto pen to actually sign the documents. What do you make of all that?  I'm troubled by the trend. Do you remember when Barack Obama had to disappoint Democrats in 2009 and said, I'm not going to prosecute, we're not prosecuting Donald Rumsfeld. We're not going to prosecute Dick Cheney or Paul Wolfowitz or whomever for the Iraq invasion. They had their turn. They did what they thought was the best, but we're not going to relitigate that. We're going to move forward.  And what we saw with the first Trump administration and certainly the Biden administration and now the next Trump administration is, it's a self-licking ice cream cone. We just keep going back and back and back. And if they keep it up with Biden, they will keep it up with Biden and they keep doing it.  When there's a Democratic president, they're going to go back and make people take the fifth and demand testimony about Donald Trump's state of mind when he was president. And was he mentally, how was his cognitive level when he was president? And did he ever say this? And did he ever say that? Bad things lie that way. When you get into relitigating and unpacking these former things, you don't really get to the truth very often. And what you end up doing is getting stuck in a hole.  Yeah. All right. Chris Starwalt, something tells me we're not going to hear the end of either the Ida Penn or Jeffrey Epstein. So stay tuned, as they say. Thanks, Chris. Oh, by the way, I noticed on stage today you guys were giving out gift bags to all your guests. What was in the gift? What's the swag for all the lawmakers?  Well, it's just stacks of cash. It's just hundreds in a stack. But my question is for you, which is we could get all of these powerful people to come. We couldn't get Elizabeth Vargas. Nobody invited me. I would have been there in a nanosecond. I would have totally come down there. Well, next time you're coming and we're going to do one of these together.  This tape lives forever, Chris Starwell. All right, thanks so much. In the meantime, while Jeffrey Epstein continues, for whatever reason, to be the hottest topic in Washington, D.C., much to President Trump's frustration, he does have other very big and very important issues he's focusing on.  one that is arguably a lot more important to the lives of Americans, and that is cracking down on the fentanyl epidemic. Let's go right now to News Nation's Kelly Meyer now, live for us at the White House. Kelly, the president held a big signing ceremony today on this bill that Congress passed combating fentanyl. This has been a big part of his agenda.  Yes, certainly cracking down on this drug, a major focus for the president's agenda, and certainly a bipartisan one. So today he was able to sign this into law. He was surrounded by families who lost loved ones to the drug, and they held up photos of their lost loved ones, some giving that to the president to hold as well. Now, this bill is set to curb the illicit flow of fentanyl into the US. You see him signing the bill there.

He posted to Truth Social, writing, I've been asking and speaking to Coca-Cola about using cane sugar and Coke in the United States, and they've agreed to do so. Now, tinkering with Coca-Cola and its formula has proven disastrous in the past.  Back in 1985, the company introduced New Coke. Remember that? A sweeter version, which sparked such vehement consumer backlash, the original formula was reinstated just 79 days later.  That was before the Maha movement changed the game, however. Now, Coke would be just the latest food company to drop unhealthy ingredients. Welch's Fruit Snacks and dozens of ice cream producers recently promised to do away with all artificial dyes.

So what do you make of Coca-Cola and President Trump making this announcement that Coke has agreed to use cane sugar instead of chemicals to sweeten its beverages?  Well, first off, when I saw his tweet, I was speechless, to tell you the truth. I couldn't believe it. Just six months ago, I was on a stage talking about how Coca-Cola is made differently in Spain, in Italy, in France, in Australia, in the UK, and how they're using real cane sugar there. But here in the United States, they're using  genetically engineered high fructose corn syrup that's designed to withstand heavy doses of glyphosate or Roundup being sprayed on it. So any amount less of high fructose corn syrup in the American diet  is a good thing for Americans especially when it comes to cancer risk because we know glyphosate has been implicated to cause cancer. So this is one of the biggest maha wins to date in my opinion because this means less genetically engineered high fructose corn syrup getting in American diets.  Yeah, it's a big deal. And, you know, when you talk about glyphosate, when you were on the show last time we were talking about it, it's in everything. All of, I mean, our breads are, I mean, I started checking labels after you were on our show, and it literally, it's impossible to buy things that don't contain it.  That's right. Well, it's one thing you will not be able to find on the label, unfortunately. It's sprayed on our food. It's sprayed on corn, soybeans in this country. It's sprayed on oats, wheats, and beans right before it's harvested.  Americans have 500% more exposure to pesticides than other countries in the world. We use 25% of the world's pesticides, even though we're only 3% of the population in this world. So this is something we have to definitely look at.  By getting Coca-Cola, one of the biggest companies of the world and one of the most popular drinks in America, to stop using high fructose corn syrup and going to real cane sugar, that's going to reduce that in the American diet.  At the end of the day, we know Coca-Cola is not a healthy drink. It's still got sugar, it's still got caramel coloring level four in it, which is also considered a carcinogen. However, we need to reduce the toxic load that's being assaulted on the Americans right now.  It's not a great thing to drink, but the reality is millions of Americans drink it. What about the food pyramid? We heard this big announcement at the Hill Nation Forum today that the FDA commissioner is going to change the food pyramid. What are you expecting to see there?  Yeah, I mean, I think just the words, eat more real food and the dietary guidelines will have a tremendous effect on everything that is being produced in this country. Because even whether you agree with what the government says about what we're eating, it trickles down into our schools, into our hospitals, into our other government funded programs. And so we're being affected by those guidelines regardless.  because that's what's being served to us when we're in these institutions. It's really important that we get the truth about what has been done to our food, how our food has changed in the last 50 years, how it's become ultra-processed, designed to make us eat more than we should, designed in a way that provides more food-like substances and ingredients that aren't  nutritious and don't provide a nutritional value to our diet. Yeah, 70% of what our kids eat is ultra processed food. That is not a good thing. Well, we need more access to real food and this is why I started my company, True Vani. I wanted ingredients that people can trust, ingredients that people can recognize and we need more food companies doing that. All right, Vani Hari, great to have you back. Thanks so much.  All right, coming up for us, Chris Cuomo is about to speak with Bordasar Tom Homan about several headlines made at our first ever Hill Nation Summit today. Chris joins me next with a preview.

Our Fed chair's term does not run coextensive with the term of the president. The president does not have the authority to fire the Fed chair. The Fed chair is different from all of the cabinet officials.  All the Cabinet officials can say, as they have, I will do whatever the president of the United States wants me to do. I will do what is in the political interests of the president of the United States. The Fed chair sits in a different box.  He has different tools, and he is supposed to be independent and make those decisions. I disagree with him often, in this case, about how he's made those decisions, but the independence itself is of value. It's of value to the United States. It's of value to our markets.

And you have to measure two different things. One is, how much are the tariffs actually directly increasing prices? But the second is, what is the cost of creating this kind of uncertainty and chaos? And the answer, we know for certain, is that there are a lot of businesses that are not investing. Who's going to build a factory? Who's going to buy expensive equipment?

She has done it all, so she is just the person for the job. Welcome, Moena, to Merrin Talks Money. Hello.  Good of you to come on. So this week, I think we have a pretty obvious topic to talk about, inflation, central banks. We had a new CPI number out for the UK today, which was higher than expected, although you do exactly have to wonder who we ask about these expected numbers, because I think I certainly expect it to be reasonably high."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 65.771, "text": "What did you expect?  It was expected to be the same and it came in a little bit higher.

And actually, we saw the core measure staying higher  and services as well. So those two things are going to be a bit of a concern I think for the Bank of England as they're deciding what to do with interest rates. They've been under a bit of pressure to sort of cut them faster but I think the current inflationary environment means that they're going to be sticking to that cautious message because they don't want to fan it further."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 118.628, "text": " We haven't mentioned the number yet. So, to be clear, the number came in at 3.6% which obviously is very significantly above the Bank of England target which they now haven't hit for a very, very, very long time. At this point, it might be easier to change the target than to attempt to hit the target. Now, one of the things that everyone is blaming for this is food retailers. So, food prices were up, 4.4% was the number there. So, that obviously fed through into quite a large part of the overall move and the retailers have all been busily blaming, well, Rachel Reeves basically.  for minimum wage changes and changes to NI etc but maybe that's a one-off."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 3, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 155.284, "text": "Well I think that is the question and that's what the Bank of England have been counting on is that these inflationary pressures that we're seeing will be one-off and they won't be passed through to secondary effects but when you do sit to see some of those food prices they are the staples and that is concerning.  And we're also seeing it in the services industry, so perhaps some of those things are not quite so easy to brush off. And there's also the uncertainty of the impact of tariffs, and we can talk more about that in the way that it isn't being seen in data so far, but certainly that people are going to be more cautious, I think, in brushing off the pressures that we're seeing."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 195.832, "text": " I mean, certainly we've had really noisy data all over the place, haven't we?

And there's still a really clear divide between the people who think that we've got an underlying disinflationary environment and the people who believe that really we're in for a long period of fairly steady inflation at a higher level than we would like. That argument still exists, right?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 5, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 224.519, "text": " Yeah, absolutely. And what we've been hearing from the Monetary Policy Committee in their speeches recently, you know, some members are more concerned about the inflationary pressures than others. And we saw that in the vote split last time. And so I think it will be quite interesting to see how they vote when we have the next Bank of England meeting next month.

And I should add that it's been expected for quite some time that there would be a cut in August. They were on hold last time.  So, you know, they don't make a sort of flash decision on the day. Sometimes, obviously, it is more short term. But they have been guiding since February for these sort of gradual and careful cuts. So, it's not really necessarily a response to what we're seeing right now as opposed to the bigger picture and the path that they are trying to guide markets that they will be taking.  But yes, we have seen them coming back a bit for the end of the year. Overall, still expecting the same amount that we were before, still expecting two cuts before the end of the year, but certainly paring away and that's actually the opposite to what we've been seeing happening in the U.S. today where they've had their PPI has come in a bit softer than expected and that sort of reignited confidence in the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates there. So, we've also seen a bit of a divergence in Treasury and gilt yields as well today."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 347.572, "text": " So, let's talk about gilt yields in the U.K. and what this means or doesn't mean for them. And we have seen yields in the U.K. rather higher than elsewhere, thanks to a general perception that we haven't really got a grip of our financial situation, which we haven't. And when you layer onto that slightly unexpectedly high levels of inflation, what does that mean for the market?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 369.661, "text": " Well it's certainly a major pain for the government that we have got such high guilt yields. They haven't gone back down. They're higher than they were during the mini-budget crisis in 2022 and that's something which is  eating into the government's ability to actually budget. Their debt costs more to service. So, that's bad news. And then what it means for sort of other markets going forward, it's just that there's that volatility now. I think that we're getting quite used to actually, we're seeing quite big swings, particularly in the longer dated debt, which  isn't a good sign in terms of confidence in the market. And in fact, we just saw last the other week when we had the incident in the House of Commons with Rachel Reason, there was concern about her, you know, we saw how the gilt market reacted then. So there's definitely quite a bit of sort of fragility in there, which I think we'd rather not be seeing, because obviously, it has a knock on impact on quite a few other  Things including other asset prices, it affects stocks, it affects investors and it just affects the certainty as well there."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 440.772, "text": " Yeah, and of course we have the other part of that problem is that as we see inflation not coming down to where we'd like it to be, a very large part of the UK guilt issuance is inflation linked.

It felt to me like a lot of sort of rather vague announcements without any clear policy that might really lead to improvement for the UK market.  Lots of nice things like, wouldn't it be nice if everyone was better educated on investment and felt like investing more like in the US, wouldn't that be good for the market, etc, etc. But very little that you could really hang your hat on."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 501.078, "text": "Yeah, absolutely.

That was the rhetoric that we expected and that was the message that we got.  actual details of policies. I think the ring fencing reforms are probably quite interesting in terms of consumer banking compared to other areas. But then there were still going to be some protections, so we don't quite know how that's actually going to work. I think the response from the city apparently was quite positive from those who were there, based on what our reporters who were covering it have said.  But again, it seems to be largely sentiment driven. I think one other thing that came up that was quite interesting is the sort of IPO task force to try and stimulate the listings market in the UK, which has been having a terrible year after several very moribund years. And that's something that I think they're really hoping to see as they try and create this sort of more investor  friendly environment as well for consumers and I think that's one sort of other message there is trying to get people more confident and interested in investing and I think reigniting the UK stock market is sort of seen as perhaps one way of doing that too."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 589.441, "text": " Yeah, it's interesting, isn't it, that she simultaneously wants everyone to invest masses in private equity by their pension funds, but at the same time to also invest in the listed markets."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 15, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 599.465, "text": "Yes, that is sort of, I suppose, a double-pronged approach there and equally controversial perhaps.

It's the only way that people can really save tax-free right now. But the question of whether it's taking money that would otherwise be invested in the UK or whether it's actually the sort of gateway for people to be interested in what their money is doing is, I think, probably the issue that's up to the debate there. Is it the same people who are maxing out their cash ISA limit?  who are the people who would otherwise be investing in the stock market, not necessarily.

And if the standard idea is that you should have three to six months of your income in cash in case of emergencies and after that you should be invested, it would seem that an awful lot of the people who are in cash ISAs should be nudged into investing for their own sake, for their long-term wealth."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 19, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 741.704, "text": " It might certainly be better at a longer term, but the mentality isn't necessarily there at the moment.

But we're also seeing some very strong reports coming through from U.S. banks today in particular. I think Goldman had its best trading revenue ever. That suggests that they're not being impacted by the trade concerns. But then if you look at companies like ASML, they are a chip maker. They are a little bit more apprehensive and they've been dialing back their guidance. And so I think we're only just starting to see  whether the threat of tariffs and the actual potential impact of those that have already been imposed is going to sort of hit companies on their bottom line as all these adjustments are being made.

As you know, Maria, China has been absolutely obstinate about stopping the fentanyl flow. And here's why that bill was so important. You get in the weeds a little bit. What China did way back in the first term with Donald Trump, when they promised  to help us with fentanyl is they ban a certain type of fentanyl. But what the chemists do is they alter the molecular structure in ways that, therefore, it's not classified as fentanyl under their laws or ours. And it's a cat-and-mouse kind of game that's been going on for years, as close to a million Americans have been killed directly or indirectly from fentanyl. So this HALT Fentanyl Act  is really, really important. It's going to, I think, put a strong dent in the flow.

Scott Besant, the other day, the Treasury secretary, said that the deadline in August for the, you know, temporary tariffs on China is loose, and maybe, you know, it will go beyond.

The problems we face, as you know, Maria\u2014no one knows this better on television than you do\u2014it's the intellectual property theft, it's the dumping, the subsidies, the fentanyl, and just a whole range of things. The good news is, we've got tariffs now that are effectively over 50 percent on communist China, and that's a good thing. We're raising billions upon billions upon billions.  There's just a lot of moving parts in this, and I let the boss do the negotiating on it. I think the bigger news\u2014and I've said this often\u2014is that the problem we face on trade is not just with China. It's with the world. I don't know how much you've talked about that Indonesia deal, but it's kind of the microcosm of  the macrocosm where the boss wants to go. Indonesia is\u2014a lot of people don't know this in America, but it's like the fourth largest country in the world. It's a big deal. But it sells us three times as much as we sell to them. And historically, they haven't bought our energy, they don't buy our ag products, they don't buy our technology.  And, President Trump, this deal is a beautiful thing for Americans. We're going to maintain a 19 percent tariff on Indonesia. They're not going to tariff anything. They're going to lower our non-tariff barriers. And if China uses Indonesia as a transshipment point to evade our tariffs, we'll be able to impose a higher tariff on them, as well, to stop the transshipment. So, that  is the kind of deal that Jameson Greer and Howard Letnik and Scott Besson are negotiating with 100 different countries. And I think we're in a really good place on trade right now. We've raised $100 billion for the American people in just six months. And the tariffs haven't kicked in in full force yet, even. So, that's kind of the chessboard.

They all differ in different ways. So, if you look at the EU, you start with the terrorists.  And that's  for the EU to deal with. And then, of course, they have the VAT tax, which adds 19 percent, I think, to the effective tariff. The VAT tax is not just an additional tariff on America. It's also an export subsidy, the way it works under the rules of the World Trade Organization.  So, it's a difficult, difficult negotiation, because they cheat us so badly. Remember, that deficit with Europe is huge. And what's interesting to me, Maria, is that China has a surplus with Europe, which is about equal to our deficit with Europe. So, a lot of  things are coming in from China, and Europe essentially is a trans-shipment point for goods here. So it's a very complex one. I would just urge the Europeans that work with us, acknowledge the unfairness of this, and don't go down the retaliatory rat hole, because that will end badly for Europe. So this is why this one's important, why you're flagging it here. It's one of our biggest trading partners, and we have all sorts of  other things going on from NATO on down. But we'd like to see VAT tax relief. We'd like to see lower tariffs. We'd like to see an end. One other thing, Maria, this just boggles your mind. It's like we've won cases at the WTO against Europe with respect to our agricultural imports, pork and beef. They don't  Respect it. Europe did not abide by those rulings by the world trade.

If they were a very credible central bank, they could say, we're looking past this one-off change in prices. And so their hesitancy to cut rates, I think, is actually quite a mark against them. It's as if they've lost some of the credibility. Truth is, in economics and inflation, bygones are not bygones, Becky. The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them.  So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.

Credibility comes through tough times.  In the 2008 financial crisis books that you wrote about with all this outrage, I can't find anyone at the Fed who was more aggressive in trying to get to the bottom of that and pushing radical new things that you might even describe as dovish.  In the 2020 pandemic came, there was a huge shutdown to the economy. A month before, Chairman Powell and the group over there said, well, maybe we should be cutting rates. I spoke and wrote vociferously that the US should be leading an international effort to cut rates. They were slow there.  In 2018, Jay Powell and his band of brothers put out dots that they were going to continue to raise rates through a market meltdown. I said they were out of their minds. They ended up cutting. So I think experience does help.  Uh, experience means there are times to be dovish and times to be hawkish. I'll give you one example of a time to be hawkish. Uh, 2021, 2022.

Now, if you listen to the Powell Fed, they say, oh, that big balance sheet, that has nothing to do with monetary policy. The real reason why we can begin reform at the Fed with a rate cut  which is just the first step to regime change, is if you look outside this window, financial markets, financial conditions, they are hot. IPO markets are back. Credit spreads are narrow. SPACs are back. Financial conditions are very loose here.  What about the real economy? It's the real economy I talked to Ken Langone about. We're near a housing recession. Real households, first-time homebuyers, small businesses, they're having a hard time getting credit. So at the same time, what can we do? Take a little of this looseness out of financial markets by getting the Fed out of the fiscal business, out of the political business, shrink that,  and then redeploy some of that liquidity to people that need it most in the real economy.

All right, Angie, thank you so much. So much going on. Now let's turn to the White House. President Trump is now downplaying reports that he's been planning to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. So markets initially dropped, this was yesterday, after a White House official said the president would likely soon fire Powell. And this was after he received support  for that move from GOP lawmakers following a meeting on Tuesday. They said he asked them about it. What do you think? Should I fire him? They all said yes. Well, markets then rebounded after Mr. Trump, who's, of course, long criticized Powell for not cutting interest rates, denied that he was planning to oust the Fed chair. Take a listen to what the president said in the Oval Office yesterday.  He's always been too late, hence his nickname, too late. He should have cut interest rates a long time ago. We're not planning on doing anything. We're very concerned. I don't rule out anything, but I think it's highly unlikely, unless he has to leave fraud. I mean, it's possible there's fraud involved with the $2.5, $2.7 billion renovation.  Well, here with more is NBC News White House correspondent Vaughn Hilliard and Investopedia's editor-in-chief, our friend Caleb Silver. Good morning to both of you. Vaughn, I will start with you. We're going to get into that whole notion there of fraud and the renovation in just a moment.

This is something that the president has floated now for months. His ire for Jerome Powell is only increased with the passing of time, with the Fed refusing to largely lower interest rates. And that is what has led the president to go behind closed doors with Republican lawmakers  back on Tuesday afternoon and tell them that he was considering firing the Fed chair. But that's when, less than 24 hours after that, you heard there from the president directly saying that it's highly unlikely that he will. That said, there's a Republican Florida lawmaker who was in the meeting there with the president.  who said that she was told that it was 99% imminent that he was going to go through with this here.

One, lower interest rates means cheaper money, means more spending by consumers and by businesses. More spending could stimulate the economy, probably more record highs for the stock market. But the real reason is because of the interest we pay on our national debt, which is some $888 billion. A lot of that is due to high interest rates. If interest rates were lower, those payments would be lower. That would free up more money for the Trump administration to pursue  whatever they want with that money, spend it on the anti-immigration policies potentially, offset some of the impact of the tariffs that are supposed to come into place August 1st.

Also, we've never had a president fire a Fed chair before. And it's not as if Fed Chair Jerome Powell makes the decision on interest rates himself. There is a committee of Fed governors, the FOMC, that makes this decision. So if he fires him, you'll get a lawsuit probably by Powell. That'll go on for months. The vice chair would be appointed.

Caleb, thank you. Vaughn, thank you. Covered a lot for us. Well, in a dramatic reversal, President Trump is now slamming some of his own supporters who have called for the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Yesterday on social media, the president called the whole thing a hoax. And this all comes after the Justice Department published a memo earlier this month stating there was no evidence of a, quote, incriminating client list. NBC News correspondent Alice Barr has the latest from Washington.  As a rare rift divides MAGA world over the Jeffrey Epstein case, President Trump growing increasingly frustrated with some of his own supporters. It's all been a big hoax. It's perpetrated by the Democrats. And some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net.  In a lengthy post on social media disowning supporters, he called weaklings for buying into what he terms BS. But while the president blames Democrats, right-wing influencers and some members of his own administration were among the loudest voices perpetuating conspiracy theories, believing that Epstein, who was charged and died by suicide in jail during the first Trump term, did not kill himself and that he left an incriminating client list.  Here's FBI Director Kash Patel two years ago. Put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are. President Trump made a campaign promise to release the Epstein files. But last week, the Justice Department and FBI contradicted the swirling conspiracies and said they would not release more evidence. Attorney General Pam Bondi has been taking the heat from angered MAGA allies, with some now directed at the president himself.  If you talk about this, I'm going to excommunicate you. Well, you're not the pope, bro. Some Republican lawmakers calling for more disclosures. The FC files need to be released. I would say, make it all public. As President Trump stands by his attorney general. She says, I gave you all the credible information. And presses his base to move on.  Multiple federal law enforcement officials tell NBC News the memo reaffirming Epstein was not murdered behind bars and that he did not keep a client list accurately describes the investigation's findings. President Trump says if the Attorney General does find more credible information, she should release it. Savannah?  All right, Alice, thank you so much. Well, as she just mentioned, President Trump has forcefully dismissed this recent interest in the Epstein case when he's tried to distance himself from Epstein. But three decades ago, the two were members of the same social circles in Florida. News Now anchor Hallie Jackson takes a look back at their history together.  President Trump dismissing the interest now in the Epstein case. I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of interest to anybody. It's pretty boring stuff. And distancing himself from the convicted sex offender, as the president's been doing for years. I had a falling out with him a long time ago. In the Oval Office in 2019, making clear his feelings on Epstein at that point. I don't think I've spoken to him for 15 years. I wasn't a fan.  There's no evidence the president is connected to any of Epstein's crimes. We do know the two did have a relationship. The president acknowledging both men crossed paths in Palm Beach back in the 90s. NBC News archival video from 1992 shows the president with Epstein at a Mar-a-Lago party alongside cheerleaders for the Buffalo Bills and the Miami Dolphins. Mr. Trump greeting guests, including Epstein.  The two chatting and gesturing to those in front of them. At one point it appears Mr. Trump leans over and tells Epstein she's hot. The video taken more than a decade before Epstein's plea deal which made him register as a sex offender in Florida. Between 1993 and 1997  Flight logs released in the trial of Epstein's now convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, show Mr. Trump flew on Epstein's plane multiple times. In 2002, Mr. Trump told New York magazine, I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. Adding, it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.

Of course, President Trump is not the only powerful person who spent time with Epstein. Former President Bill Clinton, former VP Al Gore, Bill Gates, all named in court documents as being connected to Epstein.

They wanted to target a lot more in cuts. You'll remember on the campaign trail, Elon Musk, back then when he was friendly with the president, was saying that they would cut close to $2 trillion.

But the first order of business, Jason, was to win baseball games, to get a World Series championship. At that time, it had been 84 years. We finally got over the hump in 2004, and that really did propel us. It gave John and Tom and myself  in terms of the business of sports, the confidence to say, wow, if we can do this, get the right people in the right place with Theo Epstein as our GM and Tito Francona as our manager, perhaps these skills could be replicable in other environments.

Like you want to throw out an idea to buy Liverpool Football Club when it's headed to bankruptcy in 2010. That idea came from someone in our corporate sponsorship group. They read about it in the Sports Business Journal. They loved Liverpool Football Club and they sent us a note saying, save our club.  And that's how the conversation started.

And those two words have, I think, stuck with us, stuck with John, with Tom, with everybody in the organization.  And so bold decision-making doesn't mean you're reckless, but bold decision-making means sometimes you need to do things that are not going to be perceived as popular. I can tell you lots of things that we've done from a business perspective that have not been popular, lots of things from a baseball perspective.  The decision to trade Raphael Devers in the month of June, on the day that we swept the New York Yankees to get back into this thing, was timing that we could not control. But a decision rooted in what we felt was best for the organization in the near term and in the long term. Because we couldn't find alignment, just to be direct.  We've had an amazing relationship with Rafi. He grew up in this organization. Probably a lot of mistakes that we made along the way, but ultimately, because we couldn't find alignment in the near term and for the longer term,  from our perspective, we made the decision to move on.

We couldn't find alignment on what we needed, and so we moved forward.  We've got a few players back in return. It does give us some flexibility here as we go into the deadline.

But there were a lot of people who looked at English football and European football back in the day, back when you were looking at it and said, hard pass. Like, there's no way we're going to do this. You were intimately involved in that. What do you recall from sort of those key decisions to get that deal done?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 13, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 870.072, "text": " Well, our purpose at Fenway Sports Group is to elevate brands and clubs and institutions that really matter. Liverpool Football Club matters to its global supporter base as much as any club, as much as any sporting institution on planet Earth, just like the Boston Red Sox. And so we thought our experience in Boston  with really a public trust, not a sports franchise or even a club, it's a public trust. And what do I mean by that? We have an obligation to doing everything in our power to win games at Fenway Park and to win matches at Anfield.  After we got that famous Save My Club email, we started to study Liverpool, we started to study the English Premier League, and things just started to click and really made sense. And I'll never forget  one of the first meetings we had with the investment bankers for the deal. And they were describing what needed to be done at Anfield, because Anfield needed a lot of investment and improvement. And they actually raised the idea of a new stadium.  And I pulled the guy aside and I said, listen, don't ever bring that up ever again. We've just spent a decade preserving and protecting the Mona Lisa of baseball parks in Fenway. If we're going to go into Liverpool, the hallowed grounds of Anfield, we're going to want to preserve and protect it.  So we made that very clear. And then it was literally like a light bulb went off with John Henry as he started to get into it. And I remember him saying, well, if we're going to do this, we're going to have to be prepared to beat Manchester United. Those are the Yankees. Those are the Yankees. We have to get over the hump and beat the best of the best. And so for John,  it's always been about winning. Little known fact, Alex knows this. He started his career, he was an LP with the Yankees. He was an LP with George Steinbrenner in the New York Yankees in the early 1990s. And so while they have very different personalities from what I remember about Mr. Steinbrenner,  The fierce competitor and the desire to win is always there. And thankfully, with unbelievable leadership from Mike Gordon, who's the owner who's here, who spends the most time on it, Billy Hogan, our CEO, Michael Edwards and the group over there in the football side. We've been really, really good on the pitch. We won the league title this year. And it's just been a privilege to be associated with Liverpool. But that's what we saw. We saw this club that needed  investment and it needed really professional management to come in and help it achieve what it had achieved decades prior and sort of restoring the club back to greatness."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 14, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 1055.444, "text": " I really admire John Henry and Tom Warner, and I think they're both brilliant, but they're both very different. You as the CEO, kind of describe the cadence. How often do you talk to them? How are they different? What are their collective superpowers and how do they kind of check each other?

I have a fancy title as CEO of Fenway Sports Group and CEO of the Boston Red Sox. But really, the CEO of the enterprise is this collective superpower, as you say, John Henry, Tom Werner. I would add Mike Gordon to that list. The three of them manage the partnership.  We've, you know, 2021, Jerry Cardinal from Redbird came in and has been an awesome partner as a, as an institutional investor, bringing a different lens. All four of those guys who I work for are very different personalities. But I would say if I had to boil it down, you know, going back to John,  um, and, and, and Tom, like who started this thing back in oh two, they have this incredible, um, humility about them. Um, and you know, it's, it's just amazing for people that have achieved so much. There's not this desire to, um, make anything about them.  It's always about the team, the club, the employees, the players. They really just have their priorities in order. And in terms of their personal lives, their families, they just really, really are model citizens in their lives. And so hopefully, as CEO of the organization,  We build teams of people that share those common values. And it's really, I love the old saying, humility is life's greatest achievement. And I see it every day. I mean, look, at the end of the day, John Henry is our principal owner, largest shareholder. Alex, you know him well. It's hard to find a more humble person than John for what he's achieved. I mean, he is one of the most fascinating people you'll ever meet. He's very,  introverted, quiet, but when you sit down and you talk to him, he's a business and sporting savant and his life is so interesting. I mean, it really is so interesting. He's been in so many different businesses and had success at the highest level wherever he's been. And, you know, I kind of laugh when he takes a lot of grief in the media, either Liverpool or  in Boston or Pittsburgh when the teams aren't performing well. Because when you work with them every day, to your question about cadence, we talk every single day, 365 days a year. Yeah, 24-7, WhatsApps, texts, calls, Zooms, Teams, whatever. And most of that, honestly, is rooted in  the passion for what we're doing. And I'll tell you, we focus a lot on what's going wrong. We don't focus on celebrating the success. Maybe we should a little bit more. But I think that I mentioned that healthy paranoia.

But when Commissioner Butt-Steele gave us permission to talk to you guys, it was John Henry who took the lead in recruiting me. And I spent about three hours with my former wife Cynthia, the mother of my two girls,  who's still, you know, one of my closest friends. I went to Boca and I spent three hours with him. And the next week he drove down to South Florida and spent three hours with Cynthia and I. And Cynthia was over the moon. She said, I want to be a Red Sox because of John Henry. But what stood out was his humility. His passion for baseball was second to none. That was quite surprising. How much he knew about the history of the game.  And really, I knew that the Red Sox had big things coming, because the way he articulated his vision and his passion to winning and to bringing championships to the fans of the Red Sox was infectious.

Like he's, you know, as principal owner, the buck stops with him. Our job in management is to  make certain decisions that we have the authority to make, but the really big ones, um, acquiring a football club or, you know, trading Raphael Devers, you know, we, obviously we need ownership approval. And so he is involved in every aspect of the business and, um,  I would say the other thing about him, Alex, is the sense of humor. He is really funny, dry, wit, sarcastic. We do like to laugh at ourselves. A word I can't say on the air, but we always say we're going to write a book called You Can't Make This Stuff.  up because as you know, the stuff that happens every single day in sports is just, it's crazy. Just an anecdote the other day, right before we had an off day in Washington, I was with my family right before the 4th of July holiday. I'm like, all right, it's going to be a chill day. I get a text from our head of PR at the red Sox. Did you know this? And it's social media of our players strolling through the oval office in the white house with president Trump. I'm like,  First of all, it's awesome that they got that experience. They're there. But there was a family day with the club. They had the choice of going to the White House with their families or going to the zoo or a couple of guys play golf, whatever. But so, you know, in sports, it's like just when you think you're going to have a quiet couple of hours, the media is going crazy. You know, the Red Sox are in the White House. What's going on?

You know, we've had Josh Harris on the show and David Blitzer, both of whom you know well. We've had Ted Leonsis, obviously, who you know well as well.  There are different models for this multi-club ownership, and I do wonder, from your perspective, the opportunities are clear in terms of rising valuations and a lot that you can learn, but how do you cope with sort of the challenges of a different market, of being able to sort of give the time and attention to the clubs when they need it most,  knowing that you can never get it totally right.

But I'll tell you, and Alex will agree with this, nothing, nothing replaces winning. I mean, winning on the pitch, winning on the ice, winning on the field. We never get complaints in Boston about Liverpool Football Club or the Pittsburgh Penguins or the PGA Tour if we're winning 95 games and we're, you know, winning the American League East and playing in the postseason and,  And so that really has to be our focus, is investing the resources into the right player personnel and winning games. And everything, everything fuels or runs off of that. But it is hard. It's a lot of time on an airplane, and we do sort of divide up our time and attention and energy.  John and Tom will tell you, no one from the management group within the ownership, those three guys, John, Tom, and Mike, no one has spent more time on Liverpool Football Club than Mike Gordon. I mean, this guy has just lived the last 15 years of being the Fenway Sports Group owner. It's sort of in charge of the day-to-day over there, bringing in Jurgen Klopp, putting in Billy Hogan as our CEO.  So, and again, it's just, we're all constantly in communication. Tom spends a ton of his time on English Premier League matters, but also on Nesson because of his media background. And John and I have probably taken the lead, I would say, on our golf investment the last year and a half. So we find time. We have incredibly supportive families that are all in. And look, I'll tell you, John,  Linda Henry's an investor and very involved in all aspects of Fenway Sports Group. John and Linda have this amazing relationship. It is like a family.

But one in particular who stands out is a woman named Ann Finucane, who ran Bank of America for a long time.  Came in in 2002, and I met her. So she's been 24 years a mentor. And I said, Anne, give me some advice for coming into Boston, but leadership in general. And she gave me the absolute best advice. It was, listen, there are two types of people in the world. There are people that give you positive energy, and there are people that suck the life out of you.  stick with the energy givers and the energy providers. And that's probably the best leadership and management advice that I've ever gotten because people that suck the energy out of you just they have to go and they can't be a part of an organization. You really need to be a positive force.  Ann has been incredible. A guy named Mark Flaherty, who is the vice chairman of Wellington here in Boston. Good friends of another mentor, Ed Herlihy, has been terrific. I think of Todd and Tim Laiweke, who just have done amazing things in sports. Commissioner Manfred has been incredible to me. Theo Epstein, you know, we're the same age, but I consider him a mentor. So had this just incredible group that I've been fortunate enough to  be around, probably like you, Alex, different version of a clubhouse, but just being around these people have done amazing things in business and so lucky to be exposed to different people in the sports industry.

We had an amazing relationship with Ed Herlihy, who was the chair of the board of  The PGA Tour, I mentioned Mark Flaherty, Mary Meeker, Randall Stevenson. There was a group of people on the PGA Tour policy board. And of course, Jay Monahan, who is a personal friend from Boston. He actually worked here at Fenway, became PGA Tour Commissioner. And we watched what had happened around the framework agreement.  It just didn't add up to us. It didn't make any sense. And what we realized was that this was being reported as a merger or a takeover of the PGA Tour by the Public Investment Fund. But in fact, that's not what it was. It was a very smart deal that the tour had done and the Public Investment Fund had done to drop the lawsuits against each other and endeavor to work towards a partnership.  And so we thought at the time, maybe we were crazy, but we thought that if we got involved with a consortium of US-based sports investors led by John Henry and the Fenway Sports Group, we could make progress and help out the PGA Tour.  And what do I mean by that? Well, if we come in shoulder to shoulder, provide capital, stand up a business, create equity for the players, which we did, and offer advice, suggestions, counsel on sponsorship, broadcast, event management, we might be able to help the management team and help the players as we go forward. So we stood up a business called PGA Tour Enterprises.  It was close to a $13 billion valuation at the time. We invested $1.5 billion from Fenway Sports Group, from Steve and Andy Cohen, the owners of the New York Mets, Arthur Blank, owner of the Atlanta Falcons, Wick Grosbeck, Mark Lasry. The list goes on and on. Really blue chip sports team owners that have a passion for golf, that want to be long-term partners with the players.  We thought that that might be a great path forward. We were very fortunate to be selected. They had a lot of people who are bidding and interested in helping them. And like with our other investments, whether it's Red Sox, Liverpool, Pittsburgh, Roush Fenway, I'm sure we've made every mistake in the book as we start here in the first couple of years. But as we learn the business and get involved, hopefully we'll be able to help improve the tour.  incredibly excited. We just hired Brian Rollap as our new CEO. He joins later in July, and he's a proven leader in the sports industry, great career at the National Football League, and we think he's going to do great things at the PGA Tour.

I don't think our country is ready for a communist, but we're going to see.  We are going to see, because the communist is winning. President Trump reacting to New York City mayoral candidate Zoran Mamdani coming to Washington for a breakfast hosted by AOC this morning as he tries to win over skeptical Democrats, let alone Republicans. Joining us now, the host of the Ruthless podcast that just joined the Fox family, going to Christmas party. We got their dental covered. Josh Holmes, John Ashbrook, Michael Duncan, and comfortably smug. They will sit this way for your entire tenure.  Congratulations, guys. Welcome aboard. Thank you. And I really feel like I discovered you more on that later. First off, what is it like on the outside as you watch Josh Mamdani win this primary and now has a 20-point lead over Cuomo, who decides to stay in the race? Well, it's the disintegration of the Democratic Party in many ways. It's nice to see, by the way, the renaissance of the Politburo breakfast happening.  Is anyone showing up? I mean I wouldn't show up but actually if Donald Trump did show up it would break the internet. What is a communist breakfast between AOC and Mamdani? It's probably just a bread line.  And one loaf of bread, and they just pass it down, take a bite. We'll see how it goes. Comfortably smug, tell me what you think right now that Cuomo, Adams, and Slew are all staying in the race. So I'm thrilled. I could not be happier. I think Democrats need to get what they deserve. They need to feel consequences. And if they're going to vote for a communist, they get a communist. They saw what this town was like with Giuliani. The streets were clean, everyone was safe. Bloomberg, too. Bloomberg, too. Now they need Mamdani. John, you had an interesting post. Essentially?  Yeah, well basically we were a little bit worried. We weren't gonna be able to get groceries because we haven't knocked any doors for mom Donnie We haven't made any phone calls, so we haven't gotten our voucher yet And I think it's gonna be a system kind of like if you ever sold magazines in school And then you sell enough magazines you get a prize at the end I think that's what he's gonna do with groceries in New York the most interesting answer I've ever heard was what do you think about billionaires? I don't really think we should have them  OK, good luck with that. They're the ones paying most of the bills. Now, I don't know how you guys, what you guys pretended to do to get to college. I assume all you guys went to college legitimately. Well, remember Rick Singer was the one who went with celebrities and made up different athletic feats that they made, and then got them into college. It ends up being this huge scandal. Well, now they're calling it Varsity Blues. The mastermind was opening up a new college counseling service, even though he went to jail for this, for college kids. Your reaction?  Well, I would say the whole system is corrupt when it comes to higher education, what they're charging these kids these days. So you know what?  Ain't that America? He can go right back into it, you know? I mean, like, think about what your average American family has to save to put a kid through college these days. It's outrageous. So now pay an extra fee to a guy to allow you to pay that much. Yeah, I think people are fed up with it. There was a great Fox poll just a couple weeks ago showing how many more kids are going to trade schools because they know they can have a better career as an electrician, something where they can use their hands for a living and actually earn a paycheck. And be productive.  Exactly. All right. So, Smug, tell me what it's like. You're now going to be on a digital roster. You're going to be part of the Fox family. Yeah. I could not be more thrilled. I mean, I think we've earned our keep. You know, maybe the 8 o'clock hour is a little flexible. I'd be happy to step in for Jesse, whatever's needed. 8 p.m. So, Joshua, how did this start?  Well, I mean, the podcast started four years ago. That's what I mean. And it was during COVID. They wouldn't let us into Washington, D.C. You had four bored buddies, right, who were sitting around on Zooms, having a cocktail after work. You guys have been friends for a while, or is it just, this goes back a while? Yeah, I mean, we worked together for 20 years, at least 11 with Michael, and we've known this guy for six or seven. But we're friends, like, genuinely. And we got bored during COVID. We had to start recording something, do something, because they wouldn't let us into the city. And next thing you know,  We're here. Yeah.

Then he was screaming at Tom Holman. Remember he got in Tom Holman's face when he was trying to arrest people as well. So let's not have a double standard for the next mayor of New York because he's a Democrat. So here's his clarification.  When he was on with Kristen Welker saying that, then the clip we just showed you, that was a few weeks ago. And now, according to the New York Times, they're saying that he says he'll discourage the term, globalize the intifada. The article says, Zoran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee in the race for mayor,  of New York City moved to distance himself from comments that sparked outrage during the primary. Why is he distancing himself possibly from this? Is it because he knows this is not a winning message for many people in America? Does he know that there's so many Jewish people that live here in America? Is he saying this because he believes it or he wants to win an election?  That's not distance either. We're asking for a full condemnation. We're asking for a full, we want, as they tell us with every issue, moral clarity. Say that the Jewish state has every right to exist, that you don't want to globalize the Antifa. It's definitely not a statement that we believe in either. Not one that we use every day.  But I'll add to this. He still wants to defund the police. When asked about it, he says he wants to build up mental health services. He wants social workers to go out to domestic disputes. He said, domestic disputes should be given as a traffic ticket. I was doing that police village thing over the weekend. I said, how do you view domestic calls? He goes, the most dangerous calls you can ever get. Do you think a social worker goes to college to say, now I want to go do domestic disputes, knock on a door because there's screaming on the other side?  wants to raise corporate taxes, wants to raise taxes on the rich. The rich pay the taxes for New York City. There's going to be a mass exodus. Businesses are going to leave because they don't want that 11% corporate tax on top of the city tax, on top of the state tax, on top of the federal tax. It's going to be expensive, more expensive to live here. More cops die on calls for domestic violence than any other call. And you want to send social workers there to kind of negotiate things? I'm not sure that's going to work.  Vivek Ramaswamy, Super PAC, recently debuted this billboard in Times Square. Look at this. The ad goes, tears into Mamdani with radical socialists and urges New Yorkers to flee to Ohio. Ramaswamy is the GOP candidate for governor of Ohio. And he's in focus now. Great to see you, Vivek. First of all, I mean, having him go to Capitol Hill today, your reaction to that?  Well, look, the question is, where does the Democratic Party go from here? Do they go a direction that's much more moderate, sensible, even if they disagree with us on certain policies? Or do they go the direction of a socialist party in the United States of America? That's a choice for them to make. But my own view, Harris, is that capitalism is the greatest system known to the history of man to lift people up from poverty. And we on the Republican side ought to embrace that rather than apologize for it.  One of the things that Mamdani has said in New York is that he wants to eliminate billionaires or that billionaires shouldn't exist. My view's a little bit different. The question we should be asking is how does every American child born in this country able to enjoy the most important things that billionaires do?  access to world-class education, the American dream, a place where we actually celebrate success rather than to villainize it. That's my vision for the future of our state, for our country. That's where the Republican Party, I hope, is headed. And the Democrats are lost in the wilderness, but we'll see where their chips end up landing, whether it's in the socialist lane that he's taken New York City.  Look, Vivek, I know a big part of what you talk about, too, is public safety. I mean, it's not just in our vernacular right now. It's part of life after an open border for four years with millions of people coming in that we couldn't vet.

I was one of those people, Harris. I grew up in Ohio. I went to Harvard for college. But when I graduated, I went to a New York City that was the seat of positive ambition and success and achievement in America.  Sadly, that New York City is now behind us with de Blasio, now maybe with Mamdani completing the curve. But it also shows in the country that local and state leadership actually does matter. And on a positive note, Harris, this is what makes America great, is that you could still move. I mean, we have mobile citizens across the country. People have left New York in droves. That's part of why I'm running for governor of Ohio, is that I think we need new homes.  in the heart of the country that celebrate that spirit of ambition. That's exactly what's going to happen in New York City if a guy like this becomes mayor. But the beauty is in the United States, there are still going to be other places, including like my home state of Ohio that I'm going to lead, where people can actually head to to still celebrate that American spirit. That's what I want to see. And on the rule of law, which you brought up, that's something that unites us as Americans.  I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican. Most people in this country don't want crime on the streets. Don't want the abandonment of the rule of law with crime and property theft. Most Americans agree on that. That's actually something that unites us.

What's your take on his point of view, his radicalized socialism? The president says he's communist, not too far from that if you're reading the definition.  What's your take on if this spreads to other cities? Yeah, look, I don't know him in particular, but what I will do is speak about the broader ideology. There's two competing visions for the future of the country. One is a vision where we celebrate success and we embrace it. The alternative vision is one where we penalize success and celebrate victimhood instead.  That's the direction that, sadly, the country has gone for so much of the last four-plus years. That being said, we have an opportunity to choose a different vision. And I do think that the fact that he's the Democratic frontrunner, the Democratic nominee now in New York, is actually helpful to the country to see that contrast.  Because historically, what you might have is Democrats talking out of two sides of their mouth, confounding that vision. Frankly, I think we now have an opportunity to see a stark choice and leave it to the people, not just in 2025 in New York, but in 2026 across the country. This is what the 2026 midterms are going to be about. It's a fork in the road for the future of the country. And if you want to turn achievement into something that you distribute, if you want to turn success into something that you villainize,  Great, the Democrats and Mamdani, they've paved that path. The voters deserve that choice. I don't think that's the choice that most voters are going to go for. And you mark my words, Harris, right now, if he wins this, and I think he probably will in New York City right now, that is going to be the defining rift for the 2026 midterms.

Well, look, obviously there's going to be a selection bias on the kinds of people that would participate in that kind of interview. And if you look at the polling on the other end, he is at number one. So I take the positive side of this, Harris, for the longer run. I love New York City. Frankly, it's a city where I spent nearly a decade of my life. It's America's leading metropolis. And it would be sad to see New York head in a socialist direction.  On the other hand, there's the bright side. I'm running to lead states like Ohio back to greatness. And so for America, I think there's a real positive in this, is this sets up a choice, answering the question of who we really are as Americans. Are we a people who celebrate achievement? Are we a people who are ambitious, who celebrate and embrace free enterprise and capitalism? I believe that's who we are. That's how we made America great the first time. Or are we the direction of a socialist version of a prior era of Europe?  That's a stark choice ahead. And I personally believe it is a positive to put that up as a clear choice, a defining question, a litmus test for who we are as a country, who the Republican Party is, who the Democratic Party is. So we're not just doing politics by vibe anymore, but we're actually doing politics on the basis of serious policy differences.  I think it's positive for America, as long as we have a culture of free speech and open debate, to be able to debate those differences respectfully and in the open.

My concern is  To start to walk down the line of language and making clear what language I believe is permissible or impermissible takes me into a place similar to that of the president, who is looking to do those very kinds of things.  And now it appears Mamdani is trying to walk it all back. He told New York City business leaders yesterday that he would not use the term globalize the Intifada and would discourage others from using it. He acknowledged that he used the term to express solidarity with Palestinians, but he changed his mind after speaking with Jewish New Yorkers.  Lisa, I find this hard to stomach because this entire time, Jewish New Yorkers have been expressing how frightened they are for this individual. He had the chance to condemn this from the beginning. He wasn't born yesterday. He didn't enter New York yesterday. He's been an assemblyman for a long time. So too little, too late.  Yeah, I mean, he believes it, right? I mean, we know he believes it. He's said it repeatedly. And we know what globalize the Intifada means.

There's a quote of him going around on the internet saying, if I ever run out of money, my family would be able to support me.  And then you look at things like Washington Monthly finding that a lot of the anti-Israel activity post-October 7th happened on wealthy universities, or New York Post looking into the Columbia students who were arrested, a lot of them living in multi-million dollar houses and coming from very rich families.

I want to pick up on what John Yoo said. And what follows from his economic proposals are high taxes that will strangle the middle class right out of the city. And every person I've talked to who owns a business, owns an apartment, or has a vested financial interest in New York City, they have all talked about moving out of the city, moving their businesses out of the city if Mamdani is elected.  because, you know, he's got a list of free things that he has promised if he becomes mayor. You know, free bus rides, free education, rent freezes, state-run grocery stores, and all of those things are very, very expensive. The MTA alone  It would run an $800 million shortfall every year if bus rides were made free. So who's going to pick up that burden? The taxpayers. The rich who are mobile, they will leave. So the middle class who are less financially mobile, they will be the ones stuck with that bill. And what follows from there, it's pretty ominous. Great point.  All right, Sandra, Hugh Hewitt is the host of the Hugh Hewitt Show on Fox News Radio. He's also a Fox News contributor. Hugh, good to have you with us today. I wanted to ask you, first of all, about all of the secrecy surrounding the Mamdani visit.

I'd tell the audience, if you just Google  A Politico story from June 22nd, it assembles all the evidence of Mr. Mamdani's anti-Semitism and the fact that he's going to discourage the use of the term globalize the Intifada.

Well, he's generating a lot of enthusiasm among young left-wing Democrats. We'll see where this all goes. Hugh, always great to see you. Thanks for stopping by. I appreciate it.  All right, Sandra, Zoran Mamdani takes to D.C. today to rally Democrat supporters. Party tensions flare over his socialist feud mayoral bid in New York City. One of Mamdani's top backers, AOC, says he was well-received. Mark Shorts, former White House legislative affairs director during the front's first Trump administration. Megan Hayes is a former director of message planning for the Biden White House. So, Megan, let's  Why all the secrecy about Mom Donnie's appearance today? They changed the location at the last minute, left our Ayesha Hasni trekking around D.C. to try to find out where it was. They put butcher paper up on all the windows of the restaurants so nobody could peer in.  If you like this guy and you want to get him out there, why hide him? And sometimes I think that both parties get a little too cute by half here. And it sounds like this is what was happening. I think that he is trying to plead his case to some of the established Democrats that he wants to have endorsed him. And I think that that's why they're there. And I'm sure that I don't know if Chuck Schumer was there or if Jeffries was there, but I'm sure that they probably don't want it to be running on Fox News that they were there today. So that's probably a little bit behind the secrecy. I mean, they even wished him out the back door.  Look, the visuals of him with AOC and Ilhan Omar and Bernie Sanders are great for Republicans. And I think that's what Democrats want to avoid. But it's also, I think, good for the growing anti-Semitic, anti-police, pro-sex worker caucus of the Democrat Party. Because now that you've got multiple candidates in this race, John, all he needs to do is hold on to his fervent 30%. And so his visuals of him with AOC actually continues to keep that support in lock. But it also helps Republicans a lot, too.  Well, she certainly has been the cheerleader in chief. This is what she said earlier today. Listen here. Get to know him. Get to know him. You know, this is not about having any kind of hard line. I think that if anybody is skeptical, I would say get to know him. And once you get into a room with him, kick the tires yourself and make your own assessment instead of just kind of making assessments from what you may see on television.  Don't make assessments from what you may see on television, which just happens to be words that are coming out of his own mouth. Absolutely. He has a lot to explain for some of his policies. And I don't think a lot of moderate Democrats and I don't think a lot of moderate New York Democrats and even some moderate Republicans appreciate his views and his socialist views. I think they want to see different solutions. I do think they agree with his problem of affordability. That is a major problem in New York as it is a huge problem in the rest of the country. I think the solutions are what is  I remember when my older daughter first moved to New York and she said, Dad, come and see my apartment. And it was all I could do to not pull her out of there and bring her back home. I mean, the conditions that young kids are living in these days is just extraordinary because it's just so expensive.  And they'll have a real problem. 50% of their tax comes from the top 2% of earners. So if you start losing a lot of these really wealthy New Yorkers because of his policies, they are not going to be able to afford even putting in place policies that are already there. But high costs are usually driven by government programs, less by free markets, John. And I think the reality is that having a solution to say that the government should own all the grocery stores in New York is not the way to go. And I agree with AOC. I think it's good for all Americans to get to know him, because I think that's the direction the Democrat Party's going now.  So, he did tell, he made some news yesterday, talking to New York City business leaders, in which he said, I'm going to discourage people from using the phrase, globalize the intifada. But on all his other policies, he stuck to his guns. The New York Post wrote, mayoral frontrunner Zoran Mamdani stuck to his socialist guns during a highly anticipated powwow with Big Apple business leaders Tuesday, doubling down on his plan to raise their taxes if elected.  Asked about his intent to lean on the ultra-wealthy and corporations, Mamdani told the executives that taxes had been raised on those groups in the past without it resulting in an exodus of high earners from the Big Apple.  running a business in the Big Apple and you see this guy coming along and it's going to cost you a lot more. Do you want to stay there? Do you want to move to Nashville or Dallas or Orlando or someplace like that? Their tax bracket is also extremely high in New York City. As you know from your daughter, I've lived there before. It's extremely high and it's unaffordable for people who are even  upper middle class. You can't raise a family. It's extremely challenging. So I don't think that raising taxes is going to go over very well to pay for some of his socialist policies, but get to know him. And I agree with you that people do need to get to know him and understand what he is about. And I think that this is really where the divide is going to come. Are people going to push Adams or the Republican out of the race to have it be a Cuomo-Mandami matchup, or are they going to stick with Mandami?  All right, so even if they did manage to push Eric Adams out of the race, this talk that maybe Donald Trump would benevolently give him a position in the administration to get him out of the race, can Cuomo win? I mean, he's really disliked in New York.  It certainly has huge negatives. I think that his policies towards senior citizens during COVID leaves a lot of questions. Sexual harassment, I think, is certainly going to be hanging over his head. But he'd definitely do better in a two-person race as opposed to a multi-candidate race. And a multi-candidate race favors Mondani. Are you sort of resigned to the fact that Mondani is going to win?  No, I don't think so. I think we'll have to see. I think there's a long three months ahead of us, and I think it just depends to see how the other candidates shake out. It doesn't help Democrats a lot, though, to have Cuomo back to face their party either. Right. She'll be burning two candidates.  Thanks, good to see you.

I mean, this is really frightening for the party and, you know, the party should not be a big tent that takes anyone. The party should be a tent that believes in progressive free enterprise, not in socialism.  So Mark Meadows, there's a lot of discussion about what the reaction among the GOP should be to this. And I want to pull up what Brett Stevens wrote about in his editorial yesterday.  He talks about, he says, Mamdani for mayor if you want to help the Republicans. And this is the quote, remember when Ronald Reagan ran against the San Francisco Democrats in 1984 and carried 49 states. Get ready for the GOP to run against Mamdani Democrats for several election cycles to come. What's your take on that?  Well, obviously, it is extremely troubling for the Democrat Party. They have no leader. And so as we look at that, it could be good for the GOP. But I want a bit of caution there, Martha. One of the keys, we've got a huge, huge operation. The DNC has millions of dollars. You didn't have to look any further than getting rid of Joe Biden.  in putting in Kamala Harris to understand the power that they have, and yet to underestimate that they have no captain of their ship. It's a rudderless ship that AOC took on Joe Crowley back in 2018 and became now the voice. And now they're bringing in a candidate, not even an elected official,  as this charismatic leader. I think it'll be good for the GOP only because they're embracing socialism, they're embracing these extreme ideas, but we ought not just sit back and take it for granted. These ideas are becoming part of the mainstream of the Democratic Party and we need to call it out for what it is.  So Mark Penn, I'm curious what you think about the Democratic Party embracing him on Capitol Hill today and getting involved in this fight in New York City for the mayor's race. And then President Trump was asked yesterday what he thought. And we know that he's had some friendly.  interactions with the current mayor, Eric Adams, in the past, but then he was asked about Cuomo and he said, well, I think he should stay in the race. What do you think about, you know, sort of the big tops of the parties involvement in this race and about Cuomo and Adams?  Well, this is really something in which I hope Democrats, Republicans and independents will come together on that. The fact that he won the primary doesn't mean that he got elected. Normally in New York City, we would have had a runoff among the top two candidates.  You've got Cuomo and Adams who are still in the race. I think this is an opportunity for actually bipartisan centrist action to prevent a major city from going into socialist hands.  And I think that's something that a lot of voters can agree upon."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 51, "speaker": "SPEAKER_00", "start": 2417.911, "text": "And that party that you saw today that was the left wing of the party.

This Mom Donnie thing, in some ways, I'm like, I don't want to do it. It's a New York story. In other ways, I'm like, Mom Donnie, like, he's a radical. Is he really representative? And the answer increasingly is yes. Yes, he's representative of Democrats. Yes.  Well, I think your instincts were spot on with us. And to prove that point further, they're trying to use this guy as a way to redefine what a socialist is. One of the giveaway quotes was from this Democrat out of California, Mark Takano. And he was telling the press, well, the problem with these older voters and why, you know, Ma'am Donnie is struggling with them, the 40 and up, is that they just have this outdated view of what a socialist is. You know, they think of Castro and they think of Venezuela. They don't think of people like AOC.  Tell me where their policies are different. That's what we're talking about. When you don't even know how grocery stores run, when you think that the government owes you an existence and should own your grocery store and buy your food for you, yeah, that's a major problem. And we've seen that fail in every single country where it's been implemented. So your instincts are right, because they're using him as this vehicle to try to rebrand socialism. But I don't think it's going to work outside of Manhattan.  That rebrand, that's interesting. They're taking an old idea, a failed idea, an idea that many times throughout history has resulted in death. And they are wrapping it up in a hipster, new, cool image. And it is working to some degree, Dana, in that young people have always flirted with Che t-shirts or something of the kind. But even people like Andrew Schultz, who you could presume fairly recently voted for Donald Trump, are kind of singing the praises of Zoran Mamdani. And it makes me worried.  whether or not you're right, whether or not this is a self-confined thing to New York City.  Yeah, I feel like some people are just going to be seamsters. And you're right. The youth are always going to\u2014because it's like it has the hot new energy, right? I mean, it's, you know, the hot new thing. Be like a, you know, kind of a fake socialist or whatever. They always go with what they think is trending. He's honestly skating by because people are overlooking how dumb he is on policy because of his youth and because he's got all these bells and whistles on in Manhattan. He's rubbing shoulders with Bernie Sanders and AOC. I mean, this idea, though, that his policies are going to work\u2014I mean,  I mean, there's a reason why Wall Street's kind of turning up their noses at him. I don't think that he's going to be further consecrated by a visit to D.C., but we'll see. Crazy things have happened, Will, as you know. So, I would actually be shocked if he doesn't win. It feels weird to say it, but I think that the more moderate, if we want to define Cuomo and Adams as being more moderate, I think that they've split that to the point where it's going to allow for this guy to win, and then New York City is going to have to deal with that in the years to come.  OK, really quickly, Dana, 30 seconds, though. Then do you share a similar, I'll call it optimism, that this type of politics doesn't have a home outside New York City, and then, therefore, an AOC actually isn't a realistic Democrat candidate for president? No, she's not. Her district, I mean, comparable to the rest of the districts in the United States, is actually quite small. I think what works on the internet doesn't work in real life. And I think that she's proven that a couple of times already. She's the hype man. She's like the Flava Flav. That's what she is for this.  Dana Lash, great to see you. Thank you so much.  It was a socialist meet and greet in DC. AOC hosting a breakfast with Zoran the Destroyer. Let's call it coffee with the commie. Dems lined up to schmooze with the radical who could be the next mayor of New York City. And from the looks of it, he's already made some comrades.

And the other thing that they did is those members that you saw came out the front door.  The AOC and Mamdani left out the back door. He doesn't want to take any questions. I can't remember who it was. Was it Debbie Dingell or maybe it was Prayal Pal who said, people just need to get to know him better and then they're going to like him better. OK, well, here's the thing. His meeting with business leaders, Wall Street guys, did not go well. And that's where he's pledged to stop saying globalize the Intifada. It wasn't because it was like at the  meeting with the Jewish community, and that meeting didn't go well for me either. So I'm not buying it that the more you get to know him, the more you actually like him. I think that the more you get to know him, the more you are maybe terrified about it. But I wanted to also say this. So AOC and Zoran are kind of similar in that she caught the establishment candidate flat-footed. And he saw an opportunity, and he zoomed in. OK, that's great. They connected with voters where they are. They were young and fun, and they were  talking to them on social media, TikTok, whatever it is. But here's the difference. AOC is one of 435 members of Congress. If he wins, and it's likely that he will, then he will be in charge of the largest city in the country, the most important city, I think, financially, in the world, and it's 8 million residents, and that is different.

And there was one promise that they were looking for that they got. He's saying that he's not going to reduce NYPD headcount and has said very nice things about police commissioner Jessica Tish. It was also  I believe her dad was at the meeting the business leaders meeting as well. So that's something that has kind of allayed fears there. But Catherine Wilde who's a power broker they call the CEO of the Partnership for New York and she's kind of the lead liaison between  public servants and the business community said that the crowd was very guarded, recognized how smart he is, what a good communicator he is, still has a lot of concerns, but that there are a lot of comparisons that they can make to de Blasio, that the policies are actually not that different. And they did survive the de Blasio era. So people are trying to focus on what he can actually accomplish versus what he's talking about. Like, he can't raise our taxes. The state has to raise our taxes. Where he can really do a lot of damage is in the world of real estate.  And so people who work in the real estate sector are the ones that are particularly concerned with that. As for Trump getting involved, I thought it was interesting that he seemed to throw his support behind Cuomo and not behind Adams. Cuomo's obviously, you know, to take whatever he can get at this particular moment. But I agree with Dana. It feels as if mom Donnie is going to be the guy.  Well, it's very nice of him to say that he won't fire any cops after he called them racist savages. Isn't that nice? And he said he wanted to completely defund NYPD. I think it's interesting watching national Democrats trying to make him national already, even though he hasn't won the mural race. Obviously, New York City is a big player on the world stage. But they're trying to already get him to his next gig. And you have these Democrats coming out of this meeting saying, he's a small C capitalist.  He says that he hates capitalism, and that he doesn't like it, and that he is more of a socialist. And C is also the first letter of the word communist, which the president has pointed out. I'm very curious about what they discussed behind closed doors, whether they talked about whether suicide bombing is legitimate resistance, whether globalizing the intifadas, coming to Washington, D.C., which means  blowing up cafes, blowing up concerts, et cetera. Young people losing their lives for the sake of a political movement. And I doubt that they talked about communism as a movement that has killed over 100 million people throughout the course of history. So these are the ideas they don't want to really talk about, which is why they're changing the language to things like small C capitalists. But these are the things that he has said he believes in. Now he's trying to change his tune because he needs to get elected. But there's a lot of tape of him.  pushing these ideas and saying he's not a small scene capitalist. He is for these very radical ideas. And that's why Jeffries and Chuck Schumer aren't completely endorsing him, because they would be endorsing these insane ideas, which are completely antithetical to even the Democratic Party's position on a number of these issues. Let's hear from the Small C co-host Greg Gutfeld. What does that C stand for? Co. Oh, thank you.  Here's the problem. I would be for this guy if they if he walked the walk. He doesn't. He admits that if he wasn't working it wouldn't matter because his parents would support him. They held this event at a private space. It's a very swanky club. I checked it out on the Internet. They wouldn't let me in.  Shouldn't they be doing this like as a bag lunch at the DMV? I mean, isn't that how he envisions the way we should be eating? At this place, they have a wine of the month club. They have a golf tournament. These are basically country club socialists. This is how socialism can exist because they're exempt from the actual results of it. But his rise speaks to the hollowness of the current party.  You know, all it takes is a young, charming leftist to win you over, even though his ideas are old and destructive. It speaks to the party's abandonment of mainstream America. Part of that is because, you know, they don't want to be seen agreeing with Trump, so they'd rather just destroy a city. But this is how ideology works. You can't make it less ideological.  or else it wouldn't exist. It's just frightening how these beliefs can just be reborn. He's pure, unadulterated Marxism, but it's being relaunched as something new. They're basically giving Chairman Mao a makeover. And the libs and the media, they fall for it every time because it's always the same thing. This type of ideology survives through the disguise of compassion.  You know, the rhetoric is easy. Anyone can do it from a high school freshman to a midwit congresswoman. But it's no less deadly. If you see every issue where they push compassion as persuasion, it's always exploitation. Homelessness outreach.  ends up in billions in corruption. COVID relief led to billions in corruption. BLM led to mansions for the BLM leaders. Unscrupulous doctors made money off gender affirmation. Activists now defend bosses who use cheap labor to grow pot. And this guy, Zoran, you know, champions sex trafficking as a feminist choice.  You know, they didn't care about Epstein as a moral problem, but now they care about it because it's a political issue to exploit. There's no compassion here. It's all about getting power under the disguise of helping you. Jessica, I'd give you the last word, but I doubt you have anything better to say.  I do have something to say. You can judge if it's better. I thought that Bret Stephens' op-ed about the mom Donnie effect was really interesting, where he said he will become the poster child for the Democratic Party, and they will continue just to go back to it every single time, no matter what kind of candidate is running. And I think that that is spot on. You will have boogie mans, left-leaning boogie mans for any race, whether it's in Michigan, Nevada, et cetera. Or boogie women. I'm your boogie man. Small B.

And what studies have shown is that when you throw 17 million working class and low-income people off the health care they have, up to 50,000 Americans will die every single year. And on top of that, it's a disaster for rural hospitals.  for nursing homes and for community health centers.

And so the independence of the Fed is really the highest priority for everybody in this White House.  We have policy, the president has policy disagreements.

And if the Federal Reserve had acted at the same pace that the ECB had, then rates would be maybe about 2.5% lower than they are today. And so when people look at the fact that while several banks around the world are reducing rates this year, that the Fed hasn't changed rates since President Trump was inaugurated, then there's a concern, a legitimate concern, that the independence of the Fed is not being respected by the Fed members themselves. And so when the president speaks up about interest rates,  He's actually talking about something that market participants are talking about, too. Because if you look at the normal correlation between ECB policy and Fed policy, we're at a really, really big, unusual outlier that the US rate is so much higher than Europe's rate, for example. And so I think they're seeing inflation go down. We saw today a producer price index print where inflation was actually zero for the month. And yet, the Fed has continued to keep rates much higher.

I first want to start off by just advising that witnesses should definitely come here with the facts. One of the witnesses today stated that I was arrested, and that's a complete lie, and I want to put that on the record.  Mr. Chairman, this hearing is a shame and a complete disgrace. Just because Republicans don't want to see it doesn't mean it's not true. The charities the majority is targeting are doing the Lord's work, quite literally. Republicans are trying to misrepresent and undermine and attack the work of these charities  excuse me, these charities do to assist the most vulnerable and underserved all while quoting scripture from the Bible. No matter what narrative my colleagues across the aisle try to spin, the truth is that these religious organizations and other nonprofits are not political.  They seek to provide aid to those who are fleeing violence and seeking asylum. To every person working at the charities, religious organizations, and other NGOs that are the subject of this hearing, I say this to you, thank you, and I am sorry. Thank you for providing the services and resources that our government has failed to provide to desperate people who are in need. And I am sorry that Republicans are trying to intimidate you and prevent you from carrying out this critical work.  I am appalled that this hearing is being used as an attempt to target religious organizations and prevent them from serving their communities in accordance with their faith. Meanwhile, the Republican majority has not done an ounce of oversight of the Trump administration, even as Trump and his administration tear apart DHS.  In January, Trump installed unelected billionaire Elon Musk as the leader of Doge and empowered him to derail and demonize critical functions across the government, including at DHS. Elon has long had massive unexplained ties to China. He did not file any kind of financial disclosure, even as he took a role in overhauling the federal government. But did the Republican majority demand any information on Musk's conflicts?  Did they ask questions about his ties to the Chinese government, a topic that draws their interest in just about every context, every week on this committee? No, they did not. Instead, they turned a blind eye to DOJ, and DOJ installed unqualified staffers across DHS, gained access to sensitive security systems, and drove off untold members of dedicated civil servants carrying out important missions to secure our homeland.  DOJ has been dismantling and reshaping DHS for six months now. Has the Republican majority held a single hearing or called a single witness to examine these massive changes to the department? No, they have not. More recently, Elon Musk and Donald Trump had a very messy breakup. Perhaps men are just too fragile and emotional for these jobs. But I digress. We did, in fact, learn a few things during this breakup. On June 6, Musk tweeted,  Time to drop the really big bomb. Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT. Wow, now that's some inside information. Elon Musk, Donald Trump's right-hand man, who spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help get Trump elected, says the president is tied to the notorious child sex predator.  And look what we're talking about today. And indeed, over the past several days, Trump has moved to permanently squash the release of the Epstein files. Now, my Republican colleagues have long expressed a desire to fight human trafficking, woohoo, talking about it today, but yet scared to call out  to ask the administration to release the Epstein files. Surely that must be something we can all get behind. Surely we can all agree that if Elon Musk has evidence that Donald Trump is or has ever been involved in child sex trafficking, then Musk should be compelled to come share his evidence with this committee and the public. Now I'm sure some of my colleagues may argue that Musk is just blowing smoke, but who's to say? Let's find out.  I might have my doubts, but if you think that under oath, Musk would admit he does not actually have any evidence to back up his claims, then great. Let's find out.

Welcome to Mad Money. Welcome to Kramer. If you ain't friends, I'm just trying to make you a little money. My job, not just to entertain, but to educate, teach it. Call me at 1-800-743-CBZ. Tweet me at Jim Kramer. Maybe you hate Jay Powell. Maybe you love him. Maybe you have no idea who he is. Regardless, what you need to know is that he's in charge of the Federal Reserve. So he controls what's known as short rates. That means the short-term interest rates there are like the ones you borrowed today and pay you back tomorrow.  The president appointed the head of the Federal Reserve, but in this case it was President Trump who hired Powell during his first term. Trump now thinks Powell's doing a terrible job because he won't cut interest rates. So the president takes jabs at him every chance he gets.  And unfortunately, this presidential obsession has a lot of impact on the markets. Today, for example, we got hit on rumors that Trump will fire Powell. And then the market came back when the president said it's not true. Dow only gaining 231 points. It has to be advancing 0.32 percent. Now it's that climbing 0.25 percent. Now, I thought the sell off on the rumor and the sharp rally on the news of the president letting Powell alone was dispositive. And I'm going to tell you why.  The president wants Pell out, but when we got a whiff of the rumor that he'd take action, longer-term interest rates went up with the sacred 30-year Treasury going from 4.97% to 5.07%. Now, that was done in an hour. I know it's small, but you know the directions. Directions for interest rates to go higher. Bad. At the same time, the S&P 500 went from 6,254 to 6,201 on the rumor, but then rallied back to 6,263 after the denial. Good.  So clearly the stock and bond markets don't want Powell getting ousted. Isn't that, that's night and day, right there, boom. Now, is Powell the issue here or is it that Wall Street's terrified of the idea that the president might be able to fire the Fed chief, something he's not supposed to be able to do? Lately, he doesn't have the authority, but the Republicans control all three branches of government right now, and Trump's their guy. Of course, there are still institutions that are concerned about Federal Reserve independence, but they're financial institutions, not the political ones. The financial institutions don't have as many divisions as the political ones.  And they never will. What is rarely talked about is why Powell even bothers to stay. What's the point of taking this? Now, as someone who's had his share of national ridicule, it's not something you look forward to. But when you look at the action in the stock and bond markets today, how we went down when the rumor was first floated and went up when the president walked it back, it's worth asking why stocks didn't soar when we thought Powell was getting fired. Soar!  Stocks are supposed to benefit from lower interest rates, right? You cut rates, you get better business formation, you get stronger employment, housing market gets stimulated by teaser rates. So why didn't stocks blast off when we heard Powell, who is standing in the way of all that, was sacked? Why didn't the market go up? Legit question. One that I think the president has to be pondering. But therein lies the problem. The market, at least today, is saying that Trump might be very wrong about firing Powell.  What's the case for firing this man? We spoke to Presidential Advisor Peter Navarro last week and he thinks a good reason to fire him is that he's got a terrible track record, according to Navarro. 2018, Powell took rates up in the face of incipient weakness. 2021, he didn't take rates up because he thought that inflation was transitory. I'll admit that Powell's not perfect. Nobody bets a thousand. But we have to ask, should we judge him harshly for holding rates steady right now?  Or to put it another way, why hasn't Powell started cutting rates again? We had a cooler than expected PPI number today. That could make it easier to justify a rate cut, right? But how about inflation? The incredibly important Consumer Price Index from yesterday had some prices that had some signs of inflation from the president's tariffs. Higher prices for clothing, furniture, cleaning products, food away from home, meats, poultry, coffee, gasoline, even soft drinks. That's a long list.  Now is the tracing right? Appliances and canned fruits and vegetables went up because the tariffs were certain. We know from ConAgra that the price of tin cans went higher. Tariffs on aluminum make cans, including soda cans, more expensive. Korean and Chinese appliances went up in price because of that steel tariff. That helps give Whirlpool an edge, but it hurts you because you're going to have to pay more.  Coffee, imported, so the fall of the tariffs. Meat and poultry, that's more problems with due to the herds and flocks. Furniture, the move out of China, raised prices, same thing with clothing. Tariffs are the issue. Against all this though, if you know where to shop, not something that they put in these numbers, Amazon, Walmart, TJX, Costco, the prices are tame, come on. Score one for the president.  However, we don't know how high the tariffs are going to go, and he seems to roll out new ones every day. We don't know if there's going to be doublings or even triplings on some countries. We haven't seen the car and truck tariffs that we all fear. We haven't seen how much the imported parts of a house drove up the price of homes. We're nowhere near finishing tariffing.  And that's what Powell wants to wait for. That's why he's on hold. He's prudent. Score one for Powell. So what's the case against Powell's patience? If you believe the economy's about to fall apart, then there's no time to wait. But we just heard from the big banks over the last two days. Not one of them said the consumers heard. A lot of that's because it's still incredibly easy to find a job. Sure, there are lots of layoffs at the banks themselves, but there aren't a lot of white-collared workers without jobs. I find it very hard to worry about a downturn when employment's at 4.1 percent.  That's the problem with President Trump's position. The Fed's supposed to cut in a slowdown, but we don't have a slowdown. And the only thing that might cause one is the president's tariff policy. It's paradoxical Mexican standoff. If Powell doesn't wait, if he cuts, front-running the August set of tariffs, he'd be caving. And if he's wrong, he'll look like a fool. He has absolutely no reason to cut other than to stop the hackling.  What's in it for President Trump if he tries to fire Powell? I think we saw it today, nothing. The stock market would get rocked, long-term interest rates would rise. What president would want that to happen? If I were President Trump, I'd wait to see what happens with his tariffs. As long as inflation's stable, two and a half months from now, then by all means, bash Powell for refusing to cut rates. But today should have been a real wake-up call. For who? For the president. He does himself no favors if he fires Powell. Even if he thought Powell was a doofus, which he most decidedly is not,  You still wouldn't still be fighting all the usual enemies who cherish the Fed's independence. I'm one of them. It's been good for it's good. Good policy for our great nation. It's worked. Ain't broke, don't fix. So, Mr. President, write down this one. May 15th, 2026. That's when Jay's done. His loyalty is clear to the country. Can't beat that.  Plus, this whole rap about how Powell may have spent too much money on the Federal Reserve renovation? What is he like, that guy is like, it's not his house. Trump's credibility is hurt by this. Does Powell look like a guy who cares about this stuff? Does he look like a contractor? Honestly, the guy's so intense about his job that if you told me he didn't even choose the color of paint in his own office, I'd believe you.  Bottom line, I hope today is the last day that Trump goes after Jay Powell, whose term ends in 10 months anyway. God, if a Powell only hurt Trump the same way it hurts the markets. And I don't think the president's a masochist. At the end of the day, we're either going to see more inflation or not. If inflation really does pick up, firing Powell won't matter because the rest of the Federal Open Market Committee won't let him cut either. Mr. President, sometimes  He's a genius by me. It's better to leave well enough alone. Hey, let's go to Tom in Illinois, please. Tom! Hey, Jim. Thanks for taking my call. My pleasure.

The four big money centers, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, and the two big investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Every time earning season kicks off, I like to go over the big banks because you know what? They tell us a great deal about the economy, what's going on, whether the Fed should be cutting or raising. You get the picture. This time the banks came into earning season hot. I mean, like maybe even way too hot.  with year-to-date gains ranging from a 7% one for Bank of America to nearly 25% for Goldman Sachs. In other words, the bar was high. So even though most of them reported good numbers, sometimes they weren't good enough to satisfy Wall Street's elevated expectations.  Let's take a one-by-one, start with J.P. Morgan, the biggest bank on Earth. By the way, three times bigger than the next. I mean, that's kind of crazy, isn't it? Before on Tuesday morning, delivering a clean top and bottom line beat. Loan loss provisions were lower than expected, although their net interest income came in a tad light. CEO Jamie Dimon proclaimed that, quote, each of the lines of business performed well, unquote, though technically the two largest segments, consumer and community banking, and the commercial and investment bank, beat expectations handily.  While the smaller asset and wealth management business was basically in line with expectations, nothing wrong with that. At the same time, JP Morgan raises full year net interest income forecast by $1 billion, also raises expense guidance by $500 billion. For once, Jamie Dimon had good things to say about the U.S. economy, taking out the big, beautiful budget bill, but also throwing some cold water on  citing risks from tariffs, trade uncertainty, and the budget deficit, Fed independence. What else? JPMorgan just announced a $50 billion buyback last month after the stress test results were released, and they could do more, but would rather not if the stock gets too high. There's a lot on the one hand or the other stuff right here. John Ford would love this back. Look, the shares dropped two bucks yesterday, but there was nothing really wrong here at all. It's another good, solid quarter from industry leader JPMorgan.  Wells Fargo reported the next one, and this one really ruined my day, because we owned it for the charitable trust and Wall Street hated the results. Even though the sales and earnings were better than expected, some of that was from lower provisions for credit losses of setting the bank softer than anticipated net interest income. Wells even cut its four-year forecast for net interest income, caused people to dump the stock in droves, and me to hit the linoleum floor, always dirty, with the cheap scotch.  Now, on the company's earnings call, management tried to explain this change was intentional. Now that Wells Fargo is no longer limited by the punitive asset cap, they're prioritizing their institutional business, think sales and trading. So whatever they lose in net interest income, they expect to make up in fees. Still, the change clearly caught everybody off guard, and I didn't think they really explained it that well, hence why the stock dropped more than 5% yesterday. Still, I'm sticking with Wells Fargo for the Chapel Trust, which you can follow by joining the CBC Investing Club, I hope you do.  In fact, after yesterday's pullback, the trust upgraded Wells. We had it as a two. We took it up to a one, meaning we think the stock can be bought right now. Ultimately, I trust Wells Fargo's CEO, Charlie Scharf, who's really good. I think you can get the bank back on track. It's never really off track, but you know what? It had that asset cap, it went away, and now I think they got so many things going, it wasn't communicated well. They need an analyst meeting. With the asset cap gone, Wells has a bright future. It's just they have, I call it, a messaging problem.  Now, also on Tuesday morning, we heard from the Sainted Bank, which is Citigroup. This ended up being the best received bank quarter of the day with the Dow, with the stock jumping 13 points, 3.7 percent and hitting a 16 year high. We're pulling back a bit today. Not only did Citi report a big top and bottom line, big.  Their net interest income was much, much higher than expected, more than a billion dollars above the consensus, but I don't know why the estimates haven't caught up yet to what's going on with this bank. That's the real issue about why it keeps surprising. All five of Citi's segments grew in the quarter with the best growth coming from the wealth management business up 20 percent, their investment banking business up 18 percent, and their markets business up 16 percent. I've got to hand it to them.  Even better, management says they've made some good progress on their turnaround efforts and higher costs from the turnaround should start to come down next year. That's a big reason the stock caught fire. CEO Jane Frazier's turn is working. And as long as the bank keeps avoiding big setbacks, doesn't get injured, I bet the stock can keep climbing. After all, Citi's still the cheapest in the group by a pretty wide margin. It's got a lot more to run.  Next this morning, Bank of America put a good quarter, but it was the weakest of the four majors, while the bank managed a bottom line beat. It was the only one of the four that missed on the top line, thanks to a nasty net interest income miss, but it wasn't that big a miss. That said, Bank of America managed to maintain its full year net interest income forecast, which helped blunt the impact of the miss and why the stock didn't get hit that much. I was a tad disappointed with B of A's markets and banking segments, both of which fell short of expectations. And a quarter with so much volatility, their sales and trading business should have been printing money.  But it didn't happen. The company shares had already declined nearly 2% yesterday, fell a little bit more today. I don't know. I can't get excited about it, I guess. Now, the single best report of the big banks came from Goldman Sachs.  Another travel trust holding, they really bailed me out of this one. Now, it got me off the dirty linoleum floor, sipping this stuff, they changed the owner of this, the CEO of this today, and back with what I like. Pouring the best of the best to celebrate what was the best of the best. Goldman blew away the numbers.  I think they may have the best quarter ever for most of the divisions, thanks to the Red Hot Global Banking and Markets Division. That's the investment bank in the sales and trading operation. Investment banking up 26 percent year over year. Equities trading grew 36 percent. Fixed income currency and commodities, which sometimes really blows up the joint trading, grew 9 percent.  Big story, though, right now is the return of M&A, as M&A advisory revenue grew a staggering 71% year over year, 48% just versus the previous quarter. And it appears that CBC this morning's CEO, David Solomon, explained that Goldman's corporate clients gained confidence as the quarter went on, indicating that the strength in M&A is just getting started. That is so terrific for stocks, I've got to tell you. We're going to see some big M&A now that we've got common sense regulators.  In the end, the stock rallied more than six bucks today. You know what? I think it's going to be up much, much more. You know why? Because it is just the cheapest when it comes to EPS. More on this one later. Also this morning, we heard from Morgan Stanley. A healthy top and bottom line beat. All three of the divisions, institutional securities, wealth management, investment management, beat expectations. And by the way, the wealth and investment management business here is on fire. They continue to see big inflows. They now have $8.2 trillion in combined total client assets.  Sticky, fantastic business. Overall, very solid set of numbers in Morgan Stanley. Well, why didn't it work? Well, I think the company was actually hurt by the fact it reported the same day as Goldman Sachs. Goldman had a stronger performance than everybody in investment banking, sales, and trading spaces. Yet even Goldman couldn't rally all that much today. So it's no surprise that Wall Street shrugged at Morgan Stanley's report. The stock pulled back 1.27%. That's not a lot at all. Again, nothing wrong here. It just looked like less enticing right now than Goldman's numbers. Bottom line,  Overall, I'd say that we had a generally strong reports from the big banks, overshadowed, by the way, by the speculative stocks, the stocks that are somehow related to Ethereum or Bitcoin. It's that kind of thing that's winning, even as the banks, to me, showed me that they could go up for a very long time. You can throw this stuff away. It's all this.

He'll be back with his opinion quicker than it takes to browse the menu. Next."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 12, "speaker": "SPEAKER_02", "start": 1177.969, "text": "This market's got a lot of winners that feel like they came out of nowhere, don't they? I mean, stocks are always checking, trying to figure out what they are. I mean, last time they talked about IMAX.  Well, we're just making a fortune because this is the best way for struggling movies theaters to sell tickets. Today I got another one for you just kind of popped out of nowhere on my screen. Cheesecake Factory. Yeah. It's up over 31% year to date. Chancing the 6.5% gain in the S&P 500 over the same period. Cheesecake Factory.  So once again, I'm asking, what the heck is going on here? It's not obvious that GCH Factory would be cleaning up right now, is it? They have 350 locations across the US and Canada, anchored by their flagship brand, of which there are 215. Although they've got a bunch of others, like a North Italia and upscale Italian chain, Flower Child, fast casual chain where everything is locally sourced, all natural, made from scratch, and the Fox Restaurant concept, which is more of an innovation lab for new brands.  So what's the secret sauce that's driving this thing? Whether you're a regular customer or not, Cheesecake Factory is infamously, it's infamous for one thing, it's ridiculously large menu. It's over 20 pages long, roughly 225 different items at any given time. Of course, when you take away the roughly 45 different cheesecakes and other desserts, it's slightly more manageable. But they've still got a sprawling lineup of foods. You can't get enough of those avocado egg rolls.  Basically, Cheesecake Factory covers all the bases, making it a good choice when you're looking to go out with a group of friends. This is quite literally the safest option because nobody's such a picky eater that they can't find something to order here. As analysts at Goldman Sachs put it, this diverse menu eliminates the, quote, no vote when deciding where to go out to eat. Plus, with its wide variety of price points ranging from $12.95 for a cheese flatbread to $31 for steak frites, there's a value here for everybody.  That's crucial in this environment. Throw in Cheesecake Factory's massive portions that I believe in with leftovers, plenty of leftovers. And the value proposition here is clear. If there's one thing the winners in the restaurant space have in common right now, it's that they offer a great value proposition. I mean, given the size of this stuff, it's almost like you get two meals in one provided you use the doggy bag, which is what my father's business was. And look, even if you're not a fan, it's hard to argue with Cheesecake Factory's annualized unit volume of  $12.5 million. And that's what they make per share, and it's an obscenely large number for the restaurant industry. Everyone does marvel at these guys' profitability. High average unit volumes are great, but converting them to higher profits is even better. Luckily, management's been focused on doing just that by investing in their workforce with the goal of making the Cheesecake Factory a better place to work in order to retain talent.  On the last conference call, management proudly shared that they once again have been named a Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Places to Work for the 12th consecutive year. They got the same strategy as Costco. It's only cheaper to pay your people well because hiring new employees and then spending months to train them is a huge waste of money and really hurts the profits.  At the same time, if you consistently retain your best people, that's generally good for the numbers. As management explained on the last conference call, recent operational performance and notable results were driven by our talented team and our ongoing focus on staffing and retention.  Legend went on to say, quote, during the first quarter, we saw further improvement in our already industry-leading manager and staff retention, which we believe directly contributes to outstanding guest experiences, overall restaurant performance, and ultimately sales growth. And in fact, first quarter guest satisfaction scores improved both sequentially and year over year, end quote. Hey, look, it's hard to argue with those results. The customer's always right.  I'm calling this the Costco philosophy, but this is also very much what we heard from Kevin Hoffman. He's the CEO of Brinker, parent company of Chili's, when he was executing his big turnaround. And look, Cheesecake Factory hasn't just been relying on improved service to jumpstart this recent rally. The company's also been making changes to the menu, something they usually do to keep things fresh, just in case you were sick of the 225 items already.  Part of the main reason, really, that these semi-annual menu changes help the company is they stay on top of any hot food trends. As one JP Morgan analyst astutely noted in the last conference call, citing his hard-hitting research of going to the restaurants and trying all the new items, much of these new dishes are very vegetable-heavy. That's smart.  I can confirm that this analyst is right, although here at MadBunny, we use the more cost-effective method of looking up the changes online. Jamie Dime might have to revoke that analyst company's card. But it's true, they added a ton of vegetable dishes, giving you a few more ways to avoid that no vote from your more health-conscious friends or my vegan daughter. At the same time, Cheesesteaks Factors also changed the menu to offer their customers better value, something that they're planning to stick with going forward. The result?  When Cheesecake Factory poured its most recent quarter at the beginning of May, they delivered impressive unit level margins of 16.6 percent. Wall Street was only looking for 15.8 percent. Meanwhile, they're planning to open 25 new locations that are in growth mode this year across all their brands, although only three or four of these will be Cheesecake Factories, which isn't much given that they currently have 220 locations.  The other concepts are doing the heavy lifting. Management expects to open 6 to 7 of these North Italia locations, 6 to 7 of that Flower Child location, and as many as 8 to 9 FRC restaurants. Those of these other concepts, they're no joke either. North Italia is unified with 7.75 million. Flower Child is 4.6 million. So adding new locations will be meaningful to the overall earnings. This comes out to 7% unit growth overall, which is enough to make this a pretty compelling restaurant growth story.  So I like the company, but where do I come down the stock right now? This thing has been red hot.  Although with Cheesecake Factory set to report earnings the Tuesday after next, it might be wise just to wait and see the latest results. While performance has been strong, management's remained conservative in its outlook, so the stock might sell off even if they have a real good quarter. Despite delivering a top and bottom line beat and these impressive margins when they last reported, the stock slipped the day after earnings thanks to management's commentary that, quote, the environment doesn't feel as robust as maybe three months ago, end quote, with their second quarter revenue outlook coming in below consensus expectations. So let me give you the bottom line on Cheesecake.  Even though management's been pretty conservative in their outlook throughout this rally, I don't know if it would be prudent for me to tell you to buy Cheesecake Factory ahead of the quarter, given that the stocks rallied 30% since those comments about deteriorating the environment. And it's done so on very little news. There's a lot to like about this story, but let's see how they did last month, last quarter. As much as I want to say, let them eat cake, maybe let this one cool off before you take a bite.  Let the meat cake. You think I didn't do this whole thing so I could do that?

Commercial real estate, which actually contracted on us in the second quarter, will start to grow again and people will start new projects, whether it be in warehouse or industrial or whatever it happens to be.

I know that sounds like a really ridiculous orthodoxy, but it sure makes sense when I see, like, on my screen, the banks and what's going on. Take Goldman Sachs, a company I worked at, know very well. One reason we honor for the Chapel Trust. Whenever I get with fellow Goldman alums, and I do, or current members, I do that too, among the first things that come up after you talk friends and family is how cheap the stock is. Remember, lots of people use really sophisticated metrics involving return on transferable equity and the efficiency ratio to measure banks versus banks.  I never paid, I don't pay it that much mind. I am at heart a price to earnings multiple man. I spent about two dozen pages in the soon to be released How to Make Money in Any Market on how brilliant the P.E. multiple is when you're trying to compare apples to apples. Craziest thing is that Goldman  The fabulous firm trades at a big discount to the average stock in the S&P 500, because its earnings used to be so episodic. Notice, used to be. This is something that CEO David Solomon has worked hard to change. And this quarter showed how the company's become much more of a well-oiled machine, where you're going to get a number that doesn't swing wildly good, bad, or indifferent.

That's called pyramid style of buying. Gradually getting more bigger as it goes down.  Why did I have to give that instruction? Because when a stock starts to go lower, it will often keep going lower until all the people who don't know anything are done selling. And you get a terrific price from their ignorance. We saw that with Goldman today as the stock eventually rebounded and finished the session up more than $6. This was their best trading quarter in history.  And it's a great trading firm. Very strong wealth management, beginning of a turn in M&A and IPOs. That's really all you can ask for from Goldman. And it's the stuff that's going to make the stock a much higher multiple stock.

The good ones will tell you what lines may have been a disappointment.  Ask it to compare Goldman to the others in the industry.

How about that? I doubt if there are any fraud charges that are going to wind up sticking to J-PAL's Taj Mahal on the Potomac. In a very long FAQ of frequently asked questions published by the Fed, they made it clear that while they do work cooperatively with the National Capital Planning Commission, the board generally is not subject to direction from the NCPC.  And the review authorities are, quote unquote, advisory only. But it's a major embarrassment for the Fed in an era where the new zeitgeist is to downsize the federal government rather than make it palatial. President Trump and Doge aim to significantly reduce the federal headcount, stop using buildings or spaces that are cost inefficient, and in general, curtail the power of the deep state.  Unfortunately, Jay Powell and the Fed are infected by deep state anti-Trump sympathies, but his term will finally end next spring. And Treasury man Scott Besant has a process to choose a new Fed chair. Meanwhile, the biggest issue is how well the U.S. economy is doing without inflation.  Since January, the CPI has increased only 1.8% at an annual rate. And as I told Edward Lawrence, the producer price index has increased only two-tenths of 1% at an annual rate. And there is no convincing evidence that tariffs are inflationary.  In fact, tariff revenues are coming in at about a $300 billion clip for this fiscal year, and that's going to reduce the deficit by a significant amount. Meanwhile, the true cause of across-the-board inflation is always a combination of excess government spending and excess Federal Reserve money printing. So here are some positive facts.  Federal spending has slowed to only four point two percent over the past year. And even as a share of GDP, it's actually declined from twenty four and a half percent in twenty twenty four to twenty three and a half percent through the second quarter of twenty twenty five.  Meanwhile, the M2 money supply only rising at a four and a half percent pace over the past year. Those are counter inflationary macro numbers. And on top of that, the one big beautiful bill is basically a pro growth supply side formula of lower taxes and lower regulations.  Not only will that add to higher real wages for working folks, but it will increase productivity as new factories are being built and onshoring investment is coming to America. The AI revolution adds to productivity and we are already in the midst of a tremendous business investment boom.  All of that is also counterinflationary. And every one of these reasons argues strongly that the Fed's target interest rate should be coming down, as President Trump himself has argued.  You'd think with all those economists at the Fed in their new palace at Versailles, somebody would at least understand some of this good news. Unfortunately, we're going to have to live with Chairman Chair for a few more months. And that's the riff.

She's Bloomberg News Economics Editor. She joins us here in the Bloomberg Businessweek studio. I want to start with retail sales because a big rebound in June, a broad advance, 10 out of 13 categories posted an increase. Does this answer all questions about the health of the U.S. consumer? Are we all good?"}, {"keywords": null, "line": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 240.263, "text": " God, I wish it was that easy, Tim. It's not?

I think this is a really important point. The consumer power is the economy, but services are what they spend their money on.  Bingo."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 6, "speaker": "SPEAKER_01", "start": 269.61, "text": "Okay."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 7, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 269.89, "text": "Yes. So not to say that a third of consumer spending is nothing, but it is not the majority of where consumer spending is really directed at. So that's one thing. Second thing, these are not inflation adjusted. So when you see these increases, you can kind of do a little bit of the math since we did just get the CPI to see where prices were rising or not. But generally, if you see a number that's up, it could be up because prices are up or because actual spending activity is up.  or both. So in this case there's probably a bit of a mix of that. And either way though the takeaway from economists was definitely positive that you know we just had two months of declines in retail sales coming into June. So to see a rebound especially of this magnitude was definitely reassuring in some ways. You know that maybe tariffs are not totally sapping consumer demand at least as of yet.  But not the end all be all here which you've clearly spelled out for us here. What were some of the highlights that you saw in this print. I think I don't know if I would call it a highlight so much as a surprise that that motor vehicle sales were up as much as they were especially because we saw the administrative data from Ward's automotive groups showed that.  Car sales dropped again in June and the CPI report showed that car prices were down. So that to me would spell an overall negative for car sales. Economists are saying probably a seasonal adjustment issue because I'm not really sure how else you would get a positive number out of that. But there was also this pull forward in the earlier part of the year because consumers were very worried about what tariffs would do to automobiles. Is that part of this equation at all? Is that why it's surprising too?  I think that there's probably still, you know, there's been so many, obviously, as we know, whiplash with tariffs. Are they on? Are they not? Is it delayed? What date? So I think, you know, there was a bit of a pullback in June when like we had, you know, put to rest the idea of 100 plus percent.  tariffs on China."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 8, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 381.667, "text": "You know that was like a pact that was reached in early May and that we've had a bit of this pause until the now we had this announcement in the past week that the real more significant tariffs are going to kick in next month. At least that's the plan right now."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 9, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 394.508, "text": "So who knows. We could be going through another one of those you know lulls right now with the tariff talk that could be boosting spending and sentiment in the meantime.  Well let's talk about the job market right now. Of course we got that weekly print that we always get which is jobless claims data that came out today. We saw that the estimates were two hundred and thirty three thousand but it actually came in at two hundred twenty one thousand. So a slight miss here. But what are you really seeing when we think about the broader economy as it relates to jobless claims.  Well, it's a good thing when we see a miss on jobless claims, trying to point that out. At least fewer people are filing for unemployment. So that's a good thing. Yeah. Assuming that we're in the camp of not wanting people to lose their jobs. So that's good. And at that level of overall claims of where the initial ones have been coming in, in this like 220,000 area, that's very much in line with like the pre-COVID economy and would suggest like a pretty solid labor market overall. Granted, where  More of the concern is happening is in continuing claims. So these are people who are continually receiving unemployment benefits, whereas the other number is just new filers. So the continuing claims number is kind of been flirting with around like that two million number for a while now, kind of like up around the highest levels since the end of 2021. That one has definitely been trending in a worse direction. So for a while, it used to be bad news is good news. Where do we sit now? What do we say?  Oh, gosh. I want to say that good news is good news. I mean, it's. I think, well, a lot of it is because you're thinking from the perspective of like what happens to Fed rates, right? So, I mean, right now, all of this data is telling you that, like the economy is solid and that this is also supporting why we're not expecting to see rate cuts in July, at least July for now. Who knows? September still seems to be a wildcard.  OK, so so on this, I just want to end with you on the Fed and play some sound from one of the Kevins who is vying to be the next chair of the Fed. Kevin Warsh, former Fed governor, was on CNBC earlier today.  I think the president's language is this could be a golden age. And frankly, I think they all could be right. Good policies could advance this U.S. economy. What we call A.I. in a couple of years we'll just call business. And A.I. is going to make almost everything cost less. And the U.S. can be a big winner. If I were the president, what I'd be worried about is a central bank that doesn't see any of that.  a central bank that is stuck with models from 1978 governance from a prior period and don't recognize we could be at the front end of a productivity boom. And if I were the president, I'd be worried that they might not see it. Kevin Warsh, former Fed governor on CNBC earlier today. Molly, I want to ask you about this idea that a central bank with this dual mandate in Kevin Warsh's view might be stuck on old models and old priorities. What's your view on this?  I mean, I still think the priority for the Fed is definitely the dual mandate, as you said. So that's ensuring price stability and maximum employment."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 10, "speaker": "SPEAKER_03", "start": 579.3, "text": "And I think those are still good goals to have, no matter if you're in 1970 or if you're in 2025. There are a lot of central banks that don't have both of those. You know, they just have an inflation mandate or an employment mandate, but not both. So I think that, you know, and that's also something that for us comes from Congress. That's not the Fed's own idea. This is a mandate from Congress as to what they're meant to achieve here.  That said, I mean, yeah, the economy is rapidly evolving."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 11, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 604.625, "text": "AI certainly has a lot of promises, but I don't think that's really had any widespread impact yet in terms of like taking out jobs that were, you know, at a really widespread level here.

And of course, when those things are going to be happening a bit more notably, yes, the Fed wants to be acting forward looking, but like  You can't also be like, you know, acting in advance of like, if this is still perhaps years or decades away from now, who knows?  All right, good place to end it. Molly Smith, Bloomberg News Economics Editor, joining us here in the Bloomberg Business Week studio. We mentioned stocks are moving higher. One of the stocks getting a nice boost today is PepsiCo. Shares popping higher, as much as 7.4% earlier in the session. Right now, they're up 6.9%. The company reported organic sales growth of 2.1% in the second quarter. It outpaced the average analyst estimate. Earnings per share was $2.12, also higher than market expectations. The company maintained  its annual outlook. Let's bring in Kenneth Shea senior analyst for consumer products for Bloomberg Intelligence. He joins us from New Jersey this afternoon. I want to remind everyone can Pepsi owns Gatorade Lipton Quaker Frito Lay and a lot more. The company is working to overcome though a trend toward healthier less processed foods as well as lower cost private label options. Is it succeeding.  Yeah. Tim I think it's making progress. Sure. You know we say succeeding. It's never ending a battle to keep up with consumer shifts and tastes. But PepsiCo has been monitoring the consumer for many many years. It convinced the street I believe on the call today that it's making positive strides in keeping in tune with what you're suggesting here. First of all it's just coming off the May acquisition of Poppy a company that makes a proba prebiotic sodas and so on in saying  It is looking to increase more avocado and olive oils in its mix. It made the case that later this year, it's gonna relaunch its huge Tostino and Lay's platforms with healthier ingredients. And I think we're really excited investors also is that later this year, it's gonna expand its line of protein drinks, which are very much in sync with the GLP-1 drug user need to replenish with protein.  So all the above are signs that companies very much in tune to where the consumer is going. I think that's behind a little bit of the optimism in the share price today. Hey Kenneth, what does this all do to margins though?  Well today the company beat on the margin line and I think that was another positive. You know sentiment was pretty low with PepsiCo. The first quarter you know it was not a good one. I think you know they lowered guidance. And today you know they beat low expectations. And that is margins.  Now, the company's always been, you know, stressing productivity. And I think what gave more credence today in that call is that when they realigned their business segments earlier this year, that is they're combining the Frito-Lay franchise with Quaker, and they made the case that, you know, you had two standalone big entities and with a lot of redundancies, and they see opportunities to reduce those and to take those savings and to reinvest in some of the initiatives that I mentioned before.  So I think expectations for margins going forward are actually probably going to be raised going forward.  Pepsi also said that it was removing synthetic dyes from its U.S. school foods by the start of the upcoming school year. It plans to introduce what it calls, quote, extensions of Cheetos and Doritos with no artificial colors or flavors. I look forward to seeing Cheetos with no artificial colors. I wonder what those will look like. Oh, I'm so curious. But what's the idea? What are extensions here? What does it mean by extensions? They're not gonna change that core brand that we know. They're gonna launch different versions of these iconic brands?  Yeah, that's right. I guess they're still in the late innings of the increased spice, you know, the heat, Lay's and Cheetos. It seems like consumers can't get enough of the, you know, spicy and heat products, but they experiment with new flavors. You know, there was the promotion they had a few years ago about  of consumers writing in about the different flavors for lays. And that was a big hit. I would suspect that part of the launch we're going to see later this year may include something like that. And that gives them an opportunity to have some fun with these brands and increase consumer engagement with new flavors.  Okay, so now's the time we want to talk to you about what I think a lot of people are familiar with as Mexican Coke, the idea of Coca-Cola not being made with high fructose corn syrup, but rather real sugar instead. The president announced yesterday that Coke has agreed to use cane sugar in Coke beverages. Coke says, hey, stay tuned. You're skeptical, though, about a full-fledged change from high fructose corn syrup to sugar. Why is that?  It really comes in economics. They moved over to H.S. high fructose currency big years ago for cost savings. You know they made the case that for me you know sugar standpoint it's basically the chemical equivalent of sugar.  but it can be delivered much more economically. You've got to remember, corn is probably the most heavily subsidized commodity in America, and as such, they can obtain corn very plentiful. A lot of suppliers of corn syrup in America, and they can formulate their product very economically compared to sugar. I hear that  corn syrup. Also the shelf life is longer. So for a lot of reasons the company will be very reluctant to move away from what it's doing right now. The other quick thing I point out is that Coca-Cola most of its business is supplying concentrates to its affiliated and independent bottlers who make the finished product. It  If you switch from high fructose corn syrup to sugar, you're going to not only bear a cost to Coke, but to all its bottlers. I find it highly unlikely that Coke would want to incur that and the wrath of all its bottlers in making such a switch. It'll be interesting on Tuesday when they have their second quarter call, and I'm sure they're going to elaborate more on the details here that everyone's looking for.  My guess is that they may expand some of the sugar products, cane sugar and beet sugar, whatever products in the U.S. to complement the high fructose corn syrup versions. But I really doubt they're going to just, you know, switch all of it away from corn. So, I mean, I think it'd be really interesting, especially when you talk about these alternatives to just doing a complete switch.  But as people are having discussions what does it seem that the impact would be if there were a complete switch. Just how expensive would that be for the company.  that's tough to say. I mean, like I said, it would not be on Coca-Cola. It would also be all the bottlers. And it's a good question. I don't know the details. And I would say stay tuned to Tuesday to find that level of detail. Like I said, I'm very skeptical that this is going to be a reality, though. Was there anything on Pepsi's call that sort of alluded to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the president yesterday making this call with regard to Coca-Cola? Was there any talk of  them removing high fructose corn syrup or supplementing products with real sugar? They alluded that they were open to, you know, add more complement sugar to their portfolio. But I don't think these companies would be, you know, you know, open to a complete switch. And I think that's kind of what they conveyed today. We only have 30 seconds, but you you said they wouldn't want the Coke, for example, wouldn't want to face the wrath of its bottlers. But in a sense, they might have to face the wrath of the president.  I got to thread this needle. Stay tuned to Tuesday. The drama's building. I wish I had all the answers on this one. Tuesday it is. I hope you're in the office or at home next week following the Coca-Cola earnings, because we're certainly going to have you back, Ken, to weigh in on those.

Over the last year, not including the second quarter, Netflix was plagued with the SAG-AFTRA strikes, the fallout from that, as were the movie theaters and all the studios, really,  There just wasn't a ton of content to go around as productions had been stalled for a while. Now we're seeing in the second quarter, and we should see through the rest of the year and throughout the following year,  really good content quality, content and volume. And Netflix has so much cash to spend on that 18 billion it's earmarking for the year, likely going even higher next year.

One, they had Squid Game that brought back a lot of people that was really watched more than most shows. And then you have the WWE. I think that has kept people on the service in a way that, you know, other on-demand content  can't necessarily because for the people who watch that, it's live and it's live every week and there's a lot of shoulder programming around that. So people who signed on for that or also like that in addition to their normal content, they're going to stay on that service longer and turn out less.  Also, you have children's content, family content, and these are, you know, a portion of the population that will watch the same shows over and over and over, same movies, and you just can't really do without if that's something that your kids want to watch.  Beyond that, we've seen over the past couple of years now that just having the advertising tier has reduced churn overall. And you've seen that with such phenomenal subscriber numbers over the past couple of years because it limits churn. You just trade down for a little while when you don't have quite as much to watch.

So the subscriber numbers were phenomenal. This year, what we expect to see is, you know, the price increases driving that revenue growth as the ad share continues to move toward accretion.  And I think it's close to accretion in the North American market, but it has a ways to go in the other markets. But we'll start to see that as we go into 2026, where there's just better targeting, at least in the UCAN region, you're gonna have really significant targeting, so much more programmatic partners, and just options for advertisers that are gonna want to be on the Netflix platform, and that should drive accretion and more profitability in 26."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1571.313, "text": " Alicia Reese, thanks for joining us this afternoon.

It is our simulcast just after four o'clock when those Netflix earnings are expected to cross.  Let's stick with technology, though, because shares of the EV maker Lucid Group rising their most ever intraday after investors learned that Uber is making a 300 million dollar investment in and teaming up with Lucid and the self-driving car startup Neuro to launch a robo taxi fleet. So Uber said Thursday that it or  It's third party partners will purchase and operate lucid gravity SUVs that are outfitted with neuro driver technology on its ride sharing network. Lucid interim CEO Mark Winterhoff spoke on Bloomberg surveillance and said he's not worried about the increased demand for vehicles. We have enough  capacity to accommodate both. So we don't think that we will have that problem. I mean it's I spoke about it right now. We are still in ramping up and we have some issues to overcome. By the time there are no issues anymore with capacity. I'm very certain about that. So I don't I don't foresee any any shortages and then having to decide or are we giving it to Uber or are we giving it to customers. We will be able to satisfy both both areas.  Lucid Interim CEO Mark Winteroff speaking on Bloomberg technology earlier today. Let's bring in Mandeep Singh. He's Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Tech Industry Analyst.

And look, I think there's always that risk that right now Waymo is partnering with Uber in two cities and they're not doing it in the top five cities in the US. Austin and Atlanta aren't in the top five. So it just goes to show that Uber just didn't have the control over AV supply by partnering.  with Waymo or Pony AI and other players. Now that they have made this minority investment, they have skin in the game in terms of doing this end-to-end with Neuro and Lucid. And look, 20,000 vehicles is a pretty big number, although it's spread out over six years. But  If you're talking robotaxis, right now Waymo's total number of cars are around 1,500. So from that standpoint, 20,000 is substantial, more than 10x. And so in terms of AV share, if AV takes off,  I mean, Uber is setting themselves up for a substantial share in AVs. They already have a share of the human rights, but now with 20,000 vehicles, they can say at least we'll be a formidable player in AVs."}, {"keywords": null, "line": 25, "speaker": "SPEAKER_04", "start": 1757.326, "text": " Well, share returns for investors of Uber are looking pretty healthy to say the least.

So it may actually help Uber more on the delivery side.  And look, there are two ways to go about delivery. You could do drone delivery or you could do, you know, a vehicle delivery. But with that being said, they have one million miles driven to validate their software and their sensor suite. Compare that to Waymo, which now has around 100 million miles. So clearly they are not at the same scale, but Tesla doesn't even have published data.  around how many miles they have validated. So the number of validated miles is a very important metric. And from that standpoint, you could say Uber didn't have a lot of choice. Neuro is one of the companies that was independent, that they could invest in. Everyone else is sort of already either bought or they have folded, like Cruise. I mean, Zoox is another one. They have a partnership. And that's Amazon. That's Amazon.

Tim Stenevik and Norm Malinda in our Bloomberg Businessweek studios in New York. But let's go to Victor, Idaho now, just northwest of Jackson, Wyoming. From war, from the Rocky Mountain Economic Summit, that's where Bloomberg News international economics and policy correspondent Mike McKee is joined by former Federal Reserve governor and vice chair for supervision, Randall Quarles. Mike.  Thank you Tim. And hello to everyone who wishes they were out here in Victor Idaho. It's a beautiful day. We thank Randy Cross for taking the time to sit down with us. Obviously you you run a investment firm now in Salt Lake City and New York. When you're looking at what's been going on in Washington for Christmas worry about that. It's credibility cases.  I'm not fundamentally worried about the institution. I think that the desire of presidential administrations for the Fed to follow a common monetary policy is almost universal. The Trump administration is neither unprecedented nor unique in that at all. That's been almost every presidential administration. Mr. Trump goes about it in a somewhat more public way, but the Fed institutionally is  very able to process that in a way that doesn't compromise its independence. So I'm not fundamentally worried about it. Every Fed person I've ever talked to says politics never enters the conference room when you're making decisions. Scott Besant, on the other hand, said the other day on Bloomberg Television that what Trump is doing is working the refs, trying to get a favorable decision. Does that have any impact?  Not really. I really don't think so. If as when I joined the FOMC, I mean, I knew the Fed pretty well. I'd been a Treasury official. I'd worked with Fed in private sector capacities. I thought I knew the institution pretty well, but I'd never obviously been in an FOMC meeting where those monetary policy decisions are being discussed and made.  I was very gratified as a citizen to see how absolutely unpolitical the decision-making process was. The discussions are open. They're intelligent. People of different political backgrounds agree with each other. People of the same political background disagree with each other. The politics do not drive the decision-making.  really at all, which is what you would expect me to say. But I was I was very pleased as a citizen to see how true that was. The president has been very personal in his criticisms of Jay Powell. You work with Jay Powell for years. Is the president off the mark?  I've worked with Jay Puff for a long time. In the first Bush, Bush 41 administration, we were treasury officials together. And Jay is extremely, is much more than capable. He's a rare public servant for this country.  Now, as you look at the state of the economy from the state of Utah, what do you think in terms of the rate level now and when or if they should be cutting rates?  So I believe that over the course of next year, the economy will evolve in a way that will allow some further loosening of rates. I think that the sort of the fundamentals of the economy support a higher short-term interest rate than we had before the pandemic, than we had in the first Trump administration.  you know not wildly higher. I think that that rate will be entirely consistent with a dynamic and growing economy. And I think that the you know the economy is responding very well right now to monetary policy which suggests that the policy is not too restrictive at the moment. And given my view that I think that the terminal short term rate is likely to be materially higher than the pre pandemic rate.  You know, I don't think that you could, you know, if I were in the room, would I have a view as to whether the Fed should begin cutting in July or September or later in the year? That I don't know. But I don't believe that they're causing any significant harm to the economy with their current monetary policy. Randy Quarles, thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you. Thanks for having me.  All right, there you have it. Michael McKee, Bloomberg News international economics and policy correspondent, standing by with Randy Quarles, the former Federal Reserve governor and vice chair for supervision. They're both down or over, I should say, in Victor, Idaho, just northwest of Jackson, Wyoming. It's the Rocky Mountain Economic Summit.  It's an event that takes place each year with the top policymakers, the Federal Reserve officials, former central bankers and the like. And of course, it comes just ahead of the meeting next month in Jackson, Wyoming, where we will hear from Fed Chair Jay Powell. Had to cut that interview a little short just due to the wind. But if you missed any of it, you can check it out at Bloomberg.com and, of course, on the Bloomberg terminal.  Taking a look at equity markets on this Thursday afternoon, the S&P 500 set to close at a new record. The S&P up 6 tenths of 1% right now, as is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The NASDAQ up 8 tenths of 1% as we speak. Also keeping an eye on what's happening with Netflix, because we're gonna hear from Netflix after the bell. Those numbers typically cross right at four o'clock. We'll be doing our simulcast with Bloomberg Television, so be sure to tune in on radio and TV  for those numbers as soon as they do cross. Shares of Netflix up 1.7% as we speak. We should note that shares so far this year have been soaring. Expectations are high. Shares up 43% so far this year. And Nora, shares have close to doubled over the last year as a result of optimism around the way that Netflix has just really owned this new space.  really on a tear as you've really laid out for us. And of course we had our previous guest, Alicia, talking a bit about what it looks like heading into this earnings season and how we're actually seeing a lot of churners coming back for Netflix's ad component, that ad tier component for the company. So it seems as though people are coming back for the shows like Squid Games and all these other ones that people would like to tune into. They're willing to pay a buck or two. What's your favorite thing to watch on Netflix? You're putting me on the spot here. Let's see. I'm making a point here. I'm making a point here.  You can't name it, right? I can't name it. I think there's this, I don't know if there's this different relationship that people have now with where content comes from than that they used to have. And I think that's a challenge for a lot of people who don't follow the space extremely closely, like analysts. Right. Because, for example, you know, if my wife and I want to watch something, my wife will say, OK, I want to watch this. I don't even remember which service it's on. There's not really the association that people have like they used to with, you know, an HBO, for example, like Sunday nights on HBO when we were growing up.  We did speak a little earlier to a Wedbush analyst who talked to us a little bit about what to expect in earnings. That's Alicia Reese, Senior Vice President of Equity Research. She covers media and entertainment at Wedbush. She mentioned something that's interesting. This is another quarter, and this is how it's going to work for Netflix moving on. They're not going to be doing the guidance anymore or reporting the number of subscribers they have. That is the thing that moved the company's stock historically.  Wedbush did their own research and they found that there's strong retention that even when there's churn, people are coming back and people are coming back for the content. And, you know, if you've been following Netflix for a while, you understand that Netflix is a company that for years said, we're never going to do live programming. We're never going to do sports and we're never going to do advertising.  And we're doing it all. And they're doing it all now. We're doing it all. I mean, when you look at Wall Street, we have 42 buys on the stock, 18 holds, and only one sell. So, I mean, I think that this is really a stock that has proven itself. It's made it very comfortable across the street. Everyone's really behind it. And I think it's gonna be really interesting to see what we get from these reports, especially in comparison to all the other streaming outlets that'll be coming out with their metrics as well.  Okay, be sure to tune in. Netflix earnings, four o'clock Wall Street time, right here on Bloomberg Businessweek Radio and on Bloomberg Businessweek TV. Year-to-date shares for Netflix up 43%, shares up 1.7% on this earnings day. It is Thursday, July 17th. We are just about an hour and 10 minutes away from the close of equity trading.

We're joined by Bloomberg News earnings reporter, Red Brown.  Red, lots to choose from. Yeah, it was. You know, lately we haven't been so had such a bounty to pick from. So it's easy for me today. First one I'm looking at is Lucid Group. The ticker on that one is LCID. The big news today, besides that, Tim, we have to test drive another self-driving car. Is that? Yeah, maybe in 2026. I don't know. You tell me.  I mean, with Lucid, there is a lot of question marks around exactly that, whether or not, you know, in the past, they have struggled to actually kind of hit some of their production targets. But this go around. I know you guys are speaking with the CEO of the company today and saying that they will have the capacity to get these cars out. The news today, obviously, was the 300 million deal that Lucid signed with Uber to launch self-driving cars by next year. So it's another one of these deals that Uber is doing to do to just kind of flood the market with as many options as they can.  Have either of you been in a self-driving car? I actually haven't. I don't know how I feel about them, to be honest. Okay, Red? I'm afraid. I feel like I've been on this show saying exactly that. I was once like you, too. I was once afraid.

It's in Austin, Miami. They're going to do it in D.C. They're going to test here in New York. I'm talking about Waymo specifically.  I think the big question is whether or not they can pull this off. Waymo or anyone else can pull it off in a city like New York. They're pulling the highways in San Francisco. What else are you looking at, Red? Another one on my radar is Pepsi. Obviously they had earnings today. They came out quite strong. They were organic growth.  beat expectations. This company hasn't had a ton of momentum heading into this report, but now up 7% at the moment. That's the highest since April this year. They have had some good days so far. What caught my attention with this one was the reasons why they were doing well. It's things like, people are getting healthier, they want more protein, they want smaller serving sizes, things like that, which I don't think we always associate with Pepsi and Coke and things like that.  It's kind of the momentum right now is behind the healthier options and companies are making sure that's available to their consumers.  poppy. Have you guys tried poppy? I was just about to bring that up. I always mix poppy up with the other one. There's, it's, it's, I'm blanking right now.

I mean, it's a bit, but in that same sort of thematic vein of like, how can we be healthier? Right. So that is what consumers have been shouting out for so much. I mean, I will do it after, you know, I, you want something sweet after like a workout or whatever. It's like, you know, instead of getting a Coke, you get a poppy and you don't feel so like you just wasted your last hour.  Makes you feel better about yourself, right? Speaking of health. Yes, last one on my radar today is actually one of the worst performing stocks in the S&P 500. That's Elevance Health. They are down around 12% at the moment. That's right now trending towards the lowest points in four years. That came after the company cut its profit outlook for the year.  And this is another theme that we've been tracking through all of the healthcare insurers, is they're just having a really hard time dealing with healthcare costs at the moment. United Healthcare, obviously the biggest name in this space, has been, for me, one of the most important, I think, stock stories of the year, just considering the amount of market cap that that company has lost. And we're just seeing it kind of play out through the rest of that industry, through the smaller players as well.  And what's interesting, I saw Vital Knowledge, they put out a note essentially saying that the space has been beaten up, valuations are cheap. So there's not much of a reason for people to buy the dip because fundamentals aren't likely to improve anytime soon. All right, Bloomberg News earnings reporter, Rhett Brown.
